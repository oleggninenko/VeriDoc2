This initial section contains  brief introductory remarks.  In subsection A, I provide a high- level \noverview of my meeting with Mr. Thomas.  In subsection  B, I summarize the instructions I \nhave received from my instructing solicitors in preparing this F irst Supplemental Expert \nReport.  Finally, in subsection C, I lay out the organization of this  First Supplemental Expert \nReport.  \nA. My Meeting with Mr. Thomas \n2. On 21 February 2022, I met with Mr. Thomas, the expert appointed by Claimant to value the \nDnipro Stadium, the Dnipro Training Center, and the Airfield, by video conference.  Joining Mr. Thomas on the video conference call was his colleague Ms. Ludmila Simonova  who \nassisted Mr. Thomas with the valuation work in this matter.  Joining me on the video conference call was my colleague, Mr. Gabe Perkinson, who assisted me with the valuation work in this matter.  W e identify the matters upon which we agree and the mat ters upon which \nwe disagree in our joint statement issued on 14 March 2022 (“PTBK JS”) .   \nB. My Instructions  \n3. Solicitors for the First Defendant , Fieldfisher LLP (“ Fieldfisher”) , have instructed me to \nprepare this First Supplemental Expert R eport to address th e value of three Transferred Assets: \nthe Dnipro Stadium, the Training Center, and the Airfield.  These are Transferred Assets that \nMr. Thomas has valued on behalf of Claimant.   \n4. Insofar as possible, I  have been instructed to refrain from repeating points or issues set forth in \nmy First Expert Report.  Instead, I have been instructed to expand upon or provide additional details which would further inform the Court of my opinions and the reasons for my disagreements with the valuations submitted by Mr. Thomas .  I am further instructed to submit \nany additional documents to the Court in support of my views with  this First Supplemental \nExpert Report.  \nC. Organization of th e Remainder of this  Report  \n5. The remainder of this report contains ten  additional  sections.  In Section II , I provide an \nexecutive summary of my opinion s contained in the remainder of this report.  In Section III, I \nprovide additional commentary concerning the appropriate  standard of value  in this matter.  In \nSection IV, I explain my reliance on the NBU- approved valuations that were the product of a \nD24/1/6\nPage 6 \n tripartite agreement between the Bank, independent valuation firms retained to value the \nTransferred Assets, and the NBU .  In Section V, I  provide additional commentary on  the EY \naudits of PrivatBank and the restatement of the 2016 F air Values of the Transferred Assets.

In \nSection IV, I explain my reliance on the NBU- approved valuations that were the product of a \nD24/1/6\nPage 6 \n tripartite agreement between the Bank, independent valuation firms retained to value the \nTransferred Assets, and the NBU .  In Section V, I  provide additional commentary on  the EY \naudits of PrivatBank and the restatement of the 2016 F air Values of the Transferred Assets. In \nSection V I, I respond to Mr. Thomas’s rejection of the Cost Approach as a valid valuation \ntechnique .  In Section VII , I provide detailed commentary on the valuation reports prepared \nprior to 31 December 2016 for the Dnipro Stadium, the Training Center, and the Airfield , a \nsubset of which form the basis for th e initial 2016 Fair Values  of these Transferred Assets.  In  \nSection VIII, I provide additional commentary  on the valuation reports underlying the Restated \n2016 Fair Values of the Dnipro Stadium, the Training Center, and the Airfield.  In Section IX, I provide additional commentary on the valuations pres ented by Mr. Thomas.  S ection X \ncontains my  expert declaration.   Finally, in Section X I I provide my statement of truth.  \n6. This report is filed in conjunction with my  Second Supplement al Report, which further \ncomment s upon my agreements and disagreements wit h Mr Bezant regarding our respective \nviews of the value of the  Kyiv and Dnipro Office Buildings, the Zirka and Mir Hotels, 246 \npetrol stations and 74 oil storage facilities.  \n Executive Summary \n7. In the following subsections , I provide summary comments reflecting the content of Sections \nIII to IX of this Supplemental Report. \nA. Standard (or Basis) of Value  \n8. In Section III, I explain my view that Mr. Thomas was instructed to adopt the wrong basis of  \nvalue – Market Value rather than Fair Value.  The three Transferred Assets had to be valued \nin accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) which reflects the \nbasis upon which the Bank prepares its financial statements.  Specifically, IFRS 13 applies to \nthe valua tion of the Transferred Assets and IFRS 13 reflects the rules applicable for  \ncalculat ions of  Fair Value.  Mr. Thomas was instructed to apply  Market Value in accordance \nwith the IVS 2013 guidelines .  While IFRS 13 and IVS 2013 have a great deal in common, I \nexplained in my first report dated 24 January 2022 that IFRS 13 is more prescriptive.  As such, if Market Value and Fair Value are applied to a particular asset, deviations can result.    \n9. Moreover , it is the Bank’s balance sheet values of the three Transferred Assets ( i.e., Fair Value ) \nwhich  must be included in the Bank’s capital adequacy calculations.  As the purpose of  \nD24/1/7\nPage 7 \n transferring assets to the Bank was to improve its capital adequacy ratio under the \nRestructuring Plan, I consider it illogical to apply a different basis of value in this case .  I note \nthat Mr. Thomas and I agreed in the PTBK JS  that Mr. Thomas’ instruction to rely upon the  \nMarket Value basis of value and IVS 2013 and my instruction to rely  on the Fair Valu e basis \nof value and IFRS 13 is a material difference in our analyses.1 \nB. My Reliance on the NBU Approved Values    \n10. Mr. Thomas takes the view in the PTBK JS that the NBU were only in “receipt of [valuation] \nreports ” from the independent valuers retained by the Bank and the NBU to determine the Fair \nValue s of the three Transferred Asse ts.2  I contested t his position in the PTBK JS.3  Based \nupon my experience working with bank regulators, I would have fully expected t he NBU to \ncritically evaluate the independent valuation reports.  Although I recognize that the role the \nNBU played  in the valuation process is ultimately a question of fact, I have been shown the \nwitness statements of the Deputy Governor of the NBU – Ms. Kateryna Viktorivna Rozhkova .  \nI have revie wed relevant sections of her witness statements pertaining to th"}

Although I recognize that the role the \nNBU played  in the valuation process is ultimately a question of fact, I have been shown the \nwitness statements of the Deputy Governor of the NBU – Ms. Kateryna Viktorivna Rozhkova .  \nI have revie wed relevant sections of her witness statements pertaining to the Transferred \nAssets.  Ms. Roz hkova indicate s that she oversaw a team at the NBU that reviewed the third -\nparty valuation reports , and that the NBU was required to “verify the value ” of the Transferred \nAssets.  \n“Pursuant to Resolution 103/BT, the NBU needed to verify the \nvalue of the assets transferred to the Bank as part of the Asset \nTransfer, in order to confirm that the transfer of  those assets \nwould improve the Bank’s capital position by the required \namount . The NBU had a list of independent valuers whose \nvaluations it would accept, which was a necessary measure given pervasive problems in Ukraine at the time with fraudulent valuations of property.” [emphasis added] \n 4  \n11. Ms. Ro zhkova’s statements would appear to indicate that  the NBU  did not merely “ receive” \nthe valuation reports  as Mr. Thomas presumes.  Given that the Bank was the largest Bank in \nUkraine and systemically imp ortant to the overall financial system in Ukraine, it would \nsurprise me significantly if the NBU merely “ received the valuation reports.”   The valuation \n \n1 PTBK JS, ¶ 5.1. \n2 PTBK JS, ¶ 6.2. \n3 PTBK J S, ¶ 6.2. \n4 First Witness Statement of Ms. Kateryna Viktorivna Rozhkova (“Rozhkova I”), ¶ 168. \nD24/1/8\nPage 8 \n reports were a critical aspect of the Restructuring Plan which aimed to resolve the alleged \ninsolvency of the bank (i.e., the  capital adequacy ratio of the Bank following the transfer of \nthe Transferred Assets to the Bank).  \n12. I have worked on many bank failure,  restructuring , and privatization matters over the course  \nof my career in several different countries and most often in role as a financial expert for the \nrelevant bank regulator.  Ms. Rozhkova’s explanation of the NBU’s role in reviewing and \n“verify[ing] the value”  of the Transferred Assets is consistent with my ow n experience.  Asset \nvaluation is a critical component of calculati ng capital adequacy ratios and monitoring bank \nsolvency.  It would have surprised me greatly if the NBU would not have conduct ed their own \ncritical review and appro val or disapproval of the  value of the Transferred Assets.  \n13. Accordingly , I considered it appropriate to rely upon Fair Values verified by the NBU  as part \nof the Restructuring Plan.   \nC. The EY Audit s of the Initial and Restated 2016 Financial Statements of the Bank  \n14. I explained in my f irst report dated 24 January 2022 that EY qualified its audit opinion on the \n2016 financial statements of the Bank in several respects and one such respect was the Fair \nValues assigned to the Transferred Assets (described as repossessed collateral in the financial \nstatements).  In short, EY indicated that they did not have suf ficient information upon which \nto express an opinion with regard to the Transferred Assets.   When the Bank restated the 2016 \nFair Values for the Transferred Assets as part of its 2018 financial statement preparation , EY \nissued an unqualified opinion of the  new, and substantially lower 2016 Fair Values  for the \nTransferred Assets.    \n15. Claimant and its experts appear to interpret EY’s  initially  qualified opinion to mean that the \nFair Value calculations and the valuation techniques originally employed in 2016 were rejected \nby EY .  I have seen no specific evidence that would support this view.  Moreover, as Ms. \nRozhkova explained, the NBU had a team of people evaluating the Fair Value  calculations \npresented in the reports of independent valuer s and the NBU “ verified t"}

Claimant and its experts appear to interpret EY’s  initially  qualified opinion to mean that the \nFair Value calculations and the valuation techniques originally employed in 2016 were rejected \nby EY .  I have seen no specific evidence that would support this view.  Moreover, as Ms. \nRozhkova explained, the NBU had a team of people evaluating the Fair Value  calculations \npresented in the reports of independent valuer s and the NBU “ verified the value” of a \nsubstantial portion of Transferred Assets after its review.  I would find it rather unusual for an \nauditor to reject valuations verified by a central bank  because a primary role of the  central \nbank, as I explained earl ier, is to monitor the solvency of every bank in the system.  It would \nbe even more unusual  for an auditor to reject verified valuations of the NBU when the Bank \nD24/1/9\nPage 9 \n was undertaking a Restructuring Plan being monitored by the NBU to improve its capital \nadequac y ratio  via the transfer of assets to the Bank’s balance sheet.  \n16. I believe a more plausible explanation for EY’s qualified opinion on the Fair Values of the Transferred Assets in the 2016 financial statements of the Bank is that th e Fair Values were \nderived from outdated valuation reports .  Specifically, the Fair Values for 5 of the 7 Transferred \nReal Estate Asset s contained in the Bank’s 2016 financial statements  correspond to valuation \ndates in 2015 rather than dates closer to the balance sheet date of 31 December 2016 as shown \nin Table 1 below.   \nTable 1 – Summary of the Initial Fair Value Calculations  for Transferred Real Estate Assets  \nReflected in the Bank’s Year End Financial Statements  \n \n17. However, all 7 real estate assets were valued under  tripartite agreements to support their \ntransfer to the Bank and approved by the NBU (except in the possible case of Mir Hotel).   \nTable 2 below shows all of the updated 2016 valuations that were performed and approved by \nthe NBU in 2016.

The Bank should have updated its financial accounts to reflect all of the updated 2016 Fair \nValue calculations and submitted those reports to EY for their audit.   However, this did not \noccur.  Regardless, the 2016 qualified audit opinion could have been remedied in my view by \nproviding EY with the updated 2016 valuation reports  and the Bank updating it s accounts.   \nThere would have been no logical reason in my view for EY rejecting updated 2016 Fair Value \ncalculations knowing they had been approved by the NBU.  Relying upon the updated 2016 Fair Value calculations would have made it unnecessary to commis sion new valuers in 2019 \nto restate the 2016 financial statements because the Bank already had valuation reports for those assets.    \nD. Mr. Thomas’ Rejection of the Cost Approach  \n19.

IFRS 13 states that the chosen valuation technique(s) to apply is a matter of professional \njudgment.  IFRS 13 also indicates that th e valuation techniques to implement must be based \nupon sufficiently available information.  The Cost Approach is , in my view, an appropriate \nvaluation technique to apply to a ny asset that can otherwise by constructed with the same \nservice capacity by a wil ling buyer . These criteria  are met with regard to all three of the \nTransferred Assets that Mr. Thomas and I are valuing.  \n21. As I explain in Section VI, the use of the Cost Approach can be and often is a critical element \nwhen  analyzing assets that could otherw ise be constructed by a willing buyer.  The EY Report \nalso confirms  the relevance of the Cost Approach to the assessment of  each of the three \nTransferred Assets discussed in this report .  While the Cost Approach may not be the only \nrelevant valuation technique to apply to the Transferred Assets,  there must be sufficient \ninformation to conduct  any alternative valuation techniques such as the Income Approach.  I \nnote the EY Report indicated sufficient information wa s not available to implement the Income \nApproach for the three Transferred Assets.  I a m also of the view that insufficient information \nwas available to the valuers retained by the B ank to support the restated 2016 Fair Values  with \na reliable implementatio n of the Income Approach.  Nonetheless, the valuers forced an \nimplementat ion of the Income Approach in calculating the restated Fair Values which I \nconsider unreliable. Likewise, I am of the view  that insufficient information was available to \nMr. Thomas  for him to reliably implement the Income Approach in this matter.   No new and \nmaterially relevant information has been produced or obtained since 2016 which would support a more reliable implementation of the  Income Approach.     \n22. Given the above, I am of the  view that the Cost Approach is the only valuation technique which \ncould have been implemented  reliably either in 2016 or in 2019 when the 2016 Fair Values \nwere restated, and I believe that it is the only technique that can be reliably implemented now.  \nLastly, as explained in subsection B above, I find additional  comfort in the NBU’s verification \nof the Fair Values for the Transferred Assets that were based on contemporaneous independent \nvaluation reports which implemented the Cost Approach.    \nE.

Original 2016 Fair Values  \n23. In Section VII, I provide the Court with a review  of the Original 2016 Fair Value calculations  \nthat is more detailed than the  high- level analysis contained  in my First Report. Table  3 below \nD24/1/12\nPage 12 \n summarizes key information regarding the six valuation reports, two for each Transferred \nAsset, that were prepared prior to the date on which these assets were transferred to the Bank .   \nTable 3 – Summary Information: 2015/2016 Valuation Reports8 \n \n24. I wish to make s ix further comments on the Original 2016 Fair Value calculations. \n25. First, as is evident from Table 3 above, the Original 2016 Fair Value calculations were \nperfo rmed at valuation dates in late 2015 by the valuation firm  UCE or in  June 2016 by the \nvaluers Veritas and Kreston  and were approved by the NBU under tripartite agree ment s.  As I \nexplained earlier, t he Fair Values entered into the  2016 financial statements of the Bank in \nmid-2016 are those performed by UCE.   I do not know why the UCE valuation conclusions \nwere entered into the financial statements rather than th e values concluded by Veritas and \nKreston, but the chaotic situation of the Bank during 2016 may simply have prevented the \nBank from updating the values to those reflected by Veritas and Kreston .  I remain of the \nopinion that the values concluded by Veritas and Kreston are more appropriate and they \ncorrespond more closely to the timing of the transfer of the three Transferred Assets  discussed \nin this report . \n26. Second, as is also evident in Table 3 above, the Veritas/Kreston Fair Value calculations are all \nlower than the UCE Fair Value conclusions with the exception of Dnipro Stadium which is \nmodestly higher by UAH 26.5 million (US$ 1 million) or 1.7 percent. \n27. Third, the NBU was justified in rejecting the UCE Fair Values and verifying or validating the \nVeritas/Kreston Fair Values  given that the valuation dates utilized by Veritas/Kreston for their \nFair Value  calculations correspond more closely with the dates upon which the Transferred \nAssets were transferred.   I remain of the opinion that the UCE Fair Value calculations should \nbe rejected and su bstituted with the Veritas/Kreston Fair Value calculations  due to the ir \n \n8 Kaczmarek I, Sections VII.E -VII.G.

Fourth, I remain of the view that the Cost Approach is an appropriate valuation technique for \nthe three Transferred Assets  because the nature of these assets indicates they are substitutable  \nvia the construction of  similar asset s with the same service capacity of the three Transferred \nAsset s.  This is the primary criterion, in my view, which renders the Cost Approach applicable.  \nIf an asset with a similar service capacity to the asset being valued cannot be constructed due \nto, for example, an asset having significant "}

Fifth , I remain of the view that there is sufficient information and data to implement the Co st \nApproach.  This is a required criteria for the calculation of Fair Value under IFRS 13.  I also \nremain of the view that there was insufficient information available in 2016 to implement the \nIncome or Market Approaches.  As I have mentioned, the  EY Repor t concurs with this view.  \nAs such, the Cost Approach was the only IFRS 13 compl iant valuation technique that could \nhave been implemented in 2016.  By verifying or validating the Fair Values concluded by \nVeritas/Kreston, the NBU implicitly accepted the Cos t Approach as valid.  \n30. Sixth, it must be recognized , as articulated in my previous report, that valuations performed by \nmore than one valuer will almost always differ due to legitimate matters of professional \ndisagreement o ver various inputs  that are required for  the implementation of a valuation \ntechnique .  This means that there is a range of potential value outcomes that can be regarded \nas compliant with IFRS 13.  This is particularly so  when the valuations must be performed a s \na Level 3 valuation.  Accordingly, I do not believe it would have served to assist the Court in \nperforming my own version of the Cost Approach with my preferred valuation inputs .  Rather, \nI considered it more helpf ul to provide the Court with my opinion as to whether or not the Cost \nApproach, as implemented by Veritas/Kreston , was reasonable and compliant with IFRS 13  \n(this is often referred to in the valuation world as a “fairness opinion”) .  I remain of the view \nthe valuations performed by Veritas/Kreston were compliant with IFRS 13 .  As such, there \nwas no need for me to perform de novo Fair Value cal culations for these three Transferred \nAssets.  \nD24/1/14\nPage 14 \n F. Restated 2016 Fair Values \n31. In Section VIII, I provide the Court with ad ditional detail concerning the Restated 2016 Fair \nValue calculations. Table 4 below summarizes key information related to the three valuation \nreports on which the Restated 2016 Fair Values are based.  \nTable 4 – 31 December 2016 Restated Fair Values  \n \n32. I wish to make seven  further comments on the Restated 2016 Fair Value calculations.  \n33. First, the Restated 2016 Fair Value calculations, all performed in early 2019 , were unnecessary \nas valuations had already been performed in 2016 unde r tripartite agreements and verified by \nthe NBU.  Instead of merely updating its accounts to reflect the updated 2016 Fair Values, the \nBank waited approximately 2 years to perform a restatement.  \n34. Second, a comparison between Tables 3 and 4 above reveal s that the Restated 2016 Fair Value \ncalculations are substant ially lower than the updated 2016 Fair Value calculations.  \nSpecifically, with respect to the Dnipro Stadium, the Restated 2016 Fair Value calculation  was \nreduced  by 99 percent.  With respect to the Training Center, the Restated 2016 Fair Value \ncalculation was reduced by 57 percent.  With respect to the Airfield, the Restated 2016 Fair \nValue calculation was reduced by 90 percent. \n35. Third, Table 4 indicates that the Bank decided to commission two enti rely new valuers to \nconduct the valuation analysis supporting the Restated 2016 Fair Values.

With respect to the Airfield, the Restated 2016 Fair \nValue calculation was reduced by 90 percent. \n35. Third, Table 4 indicates that the Bank decided to commission two enti rely new valuers to \nconduct the valuation analysis supporting the Restated 2016 Fair Values.  I have previously explained that I found this decision to be rather unusual since it would have been much more \nefficient and cost effective to use the Veritas/Kre ston valuation reports prepared in 2016, and, \nif necessary, have the valuers update the valuation analysis from mid -2016 to 31 December \n2016 (the Bank’s balance sheet date).  \n36. Fourth, Table 4 above reveals that the valuers commissioned by the Bank (Sineks and Asset \nExpertise) did not rely upon the Cost Approach.  Instead, both valuers relied upon the Income \nApproach and Asset Expertise also employed the Market Approach.

Fifth, my previous review of Sineks’  Income Approach for both the Dnipro Stadium and \nTraining Center revealed that Sinek s relied upon information that was not known or knowable \nas of the valuation date.  Specifically, Sineks utilized several inputs to its Income Approach \nthat were derived from data in 2018.  As I explain ed in my original report dated 24 January \n2022, it is a cardinal rule that market valuations must be executed only using information that \nwas known or knowable at the valuation date.  This is because the purpose of a market -based \nvaluation is to determine the price for an asset that a willing buyer and willing seller would agree upon on a specific date.  By incorporating factors subsequent to the valuation date of 31 \nDecember 2016  which neither the willing buyer nor willing seller could have know n, Sineks \nviolates this principle.  As such, the Sineks valuations do not comply with IFRS 13 (or IVS \n2013) .  Nevertheless, EY issued an unqualified opinion on the Restated 2016 Fair Value \ncalculations prepared by Sineks.   This indicates to me that EY was more concer ned with having \nFair Value calculations near the balance sheet date of 31 December 2016 than having a \nvaluation that was compliant with the substantive requirements of IFRS 13.  This fact must \ncall into question the validity of EY’s audit opinion on the re stated 2016 financial statements \nof the Bank.  \n38. Moreover, the fact that Sineks had to resort to information post- dating the 31 December 2016 \nvaluation date indicates that Sineks did not have sufficient information as of the valuation date \nto conduct the Inco me Approach.  My detailed review of the Sineks  valuations also reveals \nthat they did acquire any new material information or data about the income or expenses of the \nStadium or Training Center to enable them to execute the Income Approach.  As such, Sineks \nattempted to force an implementation of the Income Approach despite  lacking sufficient \ninformation  in contravention of IFRS 13.  \n39. Sixth, Sineks states tha t it considered the highest and best use of the Dnipro Stadium to be a \nfootball stadium.  However, Sineks’ valuation report does not attempt to explore additional or alternative manners  in which Dnipro Stadium could be utilized if not owned by FC Dnipro.  In \nessence, Sineks values the Dnipro Stadium as if its use would be unchanged if owne d by a \nthird  party.  The divestiture of the Dnipro Sta dium  as an asset utilized predominantly for FC \nDnipro opened up many other possible uses for the stadium that Sineks does not consider , \nhowever .  I discuss additional or alternative uses for the Dnipro Stadium in Section IX.     \nD24/1/"}

I discuss additional or alternative uses for the Dnipro Stadium in Section IX.     \nD24/1/16\nPage 16 \n 40. With respect to the Training Center,  Sineks does consider that the use of the Training Center \nwould be altered to operate more akin to a football camp with onsite lodging.  However, \nSinek s’ highest and best use analysis wrongly centers on the lodging facilities  as the key asset \ndriving the Training Center’s use .  As I will explain in greater detail in Section IX, the Training \nCenter would be optimal ly operate d as a membership -oriented sports club that would make \nuse of the lodging facilities and football pitches to provide ancillary revenue.      \n41. Seventh, Mr. Thomas and I have agreed the Sineks ’ Fair Value calculation for the Dnipro \nStadium is neither credible nor reasonable .9  This shared view  casts further doubt upon the \nreliability of EY’s unqualified opinion on the restated 2016 financial statements of the Bank \nwhich accepted Sinek s’ Fair Value calculation as compliant with IFRS 13.   \nG. Mr. Thomas’ Market Values  \n42. I wish to make four  further commen ts on Mr. Thomas’ Market  Value calculations.  \n43. First, although Mr. Thomas and I agree that the Sineks restated Fair Value of the Dnipro \nstadium is not credible or reasonable, Mr. Thomas’ valuation of the Dnipro Stadium is not \nsignificantly different from the Sineks valuation relative to the Original 2016 Fair Value calculation.  Mr. Thomas values the Dnipro Stadium at UAH 125.4 million (US$ 5 million) or 92 percent less than the Veritas Fair Value calculation.  I therefore  conclude that Mr. Thomas’ \nvaluation of the Dnipro Stadium is also not credible or reasonable.  \n44. Second, like Sineks, Mr. Thomas also does not consider the ramifications of divesting the Dnipro Stadium from the FC Dnipro  common ownership.  If the Dnipro Stadi um were owned \nby a third party rather than as an integrated asset of FC Dnipro, there are many additional potential sources of revenue the Dnipro Stadium could generate even if it remained largely a football stadium.  I give a number of additional possibilities in which the Dnipro Stadium could \ngenerate additional revenue in Section IX.  Examples include stadium naming rights, hosting \nfootball matches for clubs affected in the Donbass region, serving as a regional hub stadium \nfor several football clubs in the region with less desirable stadiums, host ing professional and \namateur tennis tournaments, etc.  Mr. Thomas also does not consider alternative uses of the \nstadium if converted to an alternative real estate asset.  For example, the Dnipro Stadium could \n \n9 PTBK JS, ¶ 7.4. \nD24/1/17\nPage 17 \n be converted to a multi -purpose real estate project with residential apartments, a retail shopping \ncomplex, commercial real estate, and a hotel.  As Mr. Thomas has not considered such uses \nfor the Dnipro Stadium, it is difficult , in my view, for him to claim he has valued the Dnipro \nStadium under its highest and best use.  As such , I remain of the view that the Cost Approach \nremains the best valuation technique to measure Fair Value.  \n45. Third, Mr. Thomas considers the highest and best use for the Training Center  to be a s ports \ntourism property.  I consider this concept to also be flawed  because, like Sineks, the concept \nconsiders the lodging facilities as the critical asset at the Training Center driving  its use.  As I \nexplain in Section IX, a higher and better use for the Training Center would be a membership -\noriented sports club .  Members would pay an initiation fee and monthly dues fo"}

I consider this concept to also be flawed  because, like Sineks, the concept \nconsiders the lodging facilities as the critical asset at the Training Center driving  its use.  As I \nexplain in Section IX, a higher and better use for the Training Center would be a membership -\noriented sports club .  Members would pay an initiation fee and monthly dues for access to the \ncore facilities  such as the gymnasium, pool, and restaurant.  As  is typical for s uch sports clubs, \nadditional revenue could be generated from non- members by leasing the football fields and \nlodging facilities.  These assets would be capable of hosting events such as football camps and \ntournaments and would generate anci llary revenues for the Training Center.   Mr. Thomas’ \nconcept relies upon a very difficult and likely expensive marketing campaign to attract \npotential tourists seeking a sports tourism experience.  My concept would  require less costly \nmarketing to Dnipr o area residents interested in becoming  a member of a private sports club  \nand specific outreach to youth football organizations  to let them know of the availability of the \nlodging and football facilities  to host tournaments or camps.   My concept also provides \ninitiation fee revenue and a more dependable and steady flow of revenues from members.   \nRegardless, as I explain in Section VI, the Cost Approach would serve as a valid valuation \ntechnique to determine the Fair Value of the Train ing Center absent specific marketing studies \npertaining to either Mr. Thomas’ concept or my concept that would be needed  to reliably \nimplement the  Income Approach.     \n46. Fourth, Mr. Thomas considers Kreston’s Fair Value calculation for the Airfield to be non-\ncompliant with  IFRS 13.  I disagree.  Nevertheless, Mr. Thomas does not appear to \nacknowledge  that Kreston valued the buildings and structures at the Airfield at UAH 7.7 \nmillion while he  valued the same at UAH 5.7 million , a UAH difference of 2 million or just \nUS$ 80,000.   The primary difference between Kreston’s valuation of the Airfield and that of \nMr. Thomas is that Kreston included a component of value associated with the land use rights  \nof the Airfield amounting to UAH 26.3 million.  Mr. Thomas assigned no value to the land use \nD24/1/18\nPage 18 \n rights upon instructions fr om the Bank.  I consider it a factual matter as to whether the land \nuse rights were transferred to the Bank  and should be valued.  I note the EY Report indicated \nthe land use rights had substantially more value than Kreston assigned to them.  \n Additional Commentary on the Appropriate Standard of Value  \n47. The PTBK JS reveals that the experts have applied different bases of value.  Mr. Thomas was \ninstructed to utilize the Market Standard of V alue and the International Valuation Standards \n2013 (“IVS 2013”) in conducting his valuation work.10  I was instructed differently and  \nindependently confirm my instruction to be  appropriate from a valuation perspective.  I was \ninstructed to consider whether the Original 2016 Values co ncluded by independent third- party \nvaluation firms complied with the Fair Value standard as stipulated in IFRS 13 .11  Mr. Thomas \ndoes not dispute either : 1) that IFRS 13 sets forth the rules and guidelines for the proper \nmeasure of Fair Value or 2) that the Bank was required to utilize Fair Value in the preparation \nof its financial statements.  Nevertheless, the experts have acknowledged in item 5.1 of the \nPTBK JS that their use of different bases of value is a primary contributor to the differences in \ntheir respective opinions of the value of the Transferred Real Estate Assets.  I have four \nadditional comments to offer to explain  why Mr. Thomas’ instruction to use Market Value and \nIVS 2013 is incorrect and why Fair Value and IFRS 13 represent the correct standard"}

I have four \nadditional comments to offer to explain  why Mr. Thomas’ instruction to use Market Value and \nIVS 2013 is incorrect and why Fair Value and IFRS 13 represent the correct standard of value \nand implementation guideli nes, respectively . \n48. First, a s I explained in paragraph 5.5 of the PTBK JS, the overall purpose of transferring assets \nto the Bank was to improve the capital adequacy of the Bank.  More specifically, the NBU had \ndetermined that the Bank had negative capital and was required to, as a first phase in its \nRestructuring Plan,  transfer UAH 31 .13 billion of assets to the Bank to improve its  capital \nadequacy rati o to a positive level .12  These Transferred Assets had to be valued by the Bank in \nconformity with IFRS 13  for inclusion in its financial statements.  Moreover, the same Fair \nValues recorded in the balance sheet of the Bank are utilized for the purpose of measuring the \nBank’s capital adequacy ratios.  \n \n10 First Expert Report of Paul Thomas (“Thomas I”), ¶ 1.9.  \n11 First Expert Report of Brent Kaczmarek, 24 January 2022 (“Kaczmarek I”), ¶ 17.  \n12 Rozhkova I, ¶¶ 157 and 159.  \nD24/1/19\nPage 19 \n 49. Second, Mr. Thomas states in item 5.5 of the PTBK JS that se veral of the underlying valuation \nreports prepared in 2016 for the purpose of transferring the real estate assets to the Bank \nindicated that they were measuring  market value.  I acknowledged this fact , but it is not \ndecisive .  The experts do not dispute the fact that Fair Value is a “ market -based ” standard of \nvalue.  Fair Market Value is also a “market -based” standard of value.  The term “market value” \nis often utilized in a generic sense by valuers, such that the use of the phr ase does not alone \nindicate the actual standard of value applied.  What is more important than the terminology is \nwhich bases of value and accompanying guidelines should be applied when measur ing “market \nvalue.”   \n50. I noted in paragraph 5.5 of the PTBK JS th at many of the valuation reports  do not indicate \nwhether they follow IVS 2013 or IFRS 13 guidelines.  In any event, the valuations performed \nby third- party valuers in 2016 had to comply with IFRS 13 for inclusion into the balance sheet \nof the Bank.  In paragraph 6.2 of the PTBK JS, I noted that the EY Report  specifically \nexplained that they employed  the Fair Value standard in their desk review  of the Transferred \nAssets and the third-party valuation reports. \n“According [to] the terms of engagement of our Val uation \nAssignment, EY was engaged to: \n perform a desk review of the fair value  of acquired tangible assets \nbased on SOD [valuation company] valuations which were \nsubsequently verified by the NBU. A complete revaluation of such properties is not required.”\n13 [emphasis added]  \n51. Third, I noted that Mr . Thomas ’ auxiliary  instructions indicate he was asked to evaluate the \nvalues in the original and restated 2016 financial statements of the Bank.  \n“Mr Thomas has been instructed to comment on contemporaneous third -party valuations regarding the Real Estate Assets including: \n(i) valuations which support the values at which the Real Estate Assets were recognised in the Bank's original 31 December 2016 financial statements; and  \n \n13 EY Report  (PB0092834_00001_English),  p. 38. \nD24/1/20\nPage 20 \n (ii) valuations which support the values at which the Real Estate \nAssets were recognised in the Bank's restated 31 December 2016 \nfinancial statements (PT1/1.12 and Appendix A2).”14 \n52.  In order for Mr. Thomas to both comment on and make a like- for-like comparison of his \nvaluations  with the valuations  in the original and restated 2016 financial statement"}
{"start": 45500, "text": " the Bank's original 31 December 2016 financial statements; and  \n \n13 EY Report  (PB0092834_00001_English),  p. 38. \nD24/1/20\nPage 20 \n (ii) valuations which support the values at which the Real Estate \nAssets were recognised in the Bank's restated 31 December 2016 \nfinancial statements (PT1/1.12 and Appendix A2).”14 \n52.  In order for Mr. Thomas to both comment on and make a like- for-like comparison of his \nvaluations  with the valuations  in the original and restated 2016 financial statements of the \nBank , he would need to rely on IFRS 13 and the Fair Value basis of value, not IVS 2013 and \nthe Market Value basis of value because the experts do not dispute the fact that the financial \nstatem ents require the use of Fair Value and IFRS 13.  However, Mr. Thomas s tates that the \napplication of IFRS 13 and the Fair Value basis is inappropriate  for his valuation work.15  He \nalso opines  that his use of Market Value and IVS 2013 is a material differen ce in our respective \ninstructions , and acknowledges that his use of Market Value and IVS 2013 may lead to \nmaterially different valuation outcomes from Fair Value and IFRS 13 .16  These represent \nconflicts in Mr. Thomas’ analysis.  \n53. Fourth, and finally, Mr. Thomas reasons that the appropriate basis of value should be  Market \nValue as set forth in  IVS 2013 because the Transferred A ssets “were intended to be sold by \nthe Bank within a relatively short period of time.”17  I agree that the Restruct uring Plan \nindicated that the Transferred Assets were expected to be sold within 2 years (i.e., a relatively \nshort period of time).  However, this fact does not militate for a departure from the Fair Value basis of value and IFRS 13.  As I indicated in par agraph 5.5 of the PTBK JS, international \naccounting standards require that assets held for sale should be measured at Fair Value.   \n“In particular, the IFRS requires: (a) assets that meet the criteria to \nbe classified as held for sale to be measured at the  lower of carrying \namount and fair value less costs to sell, and depreciation on such \nassets to cease.”\n18 \n54. Given the foregoing, it is my view that Mr. Thomas has employed the incorrect basis of value – i.e., Market Value as set forth in the IVS 2013 guideli nes – and has reached materially \ndifferent valuation outcomes that are not relevant given the context of this valuation exercise.  \nAt all stages of the process dealing with the valuation of the Transferred Assets (e.g., initial \n \n14 PTBK JS, ¶ 2.8. \n15 PTBK JS, ¶ 5.5. \n16 PTBK JS, ¶¶ 5.1, 5.5. \n17 PTBK JS, ¶ 5.5. \n18 IFRS 5, “Non -current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations”, 2004, p. 250.

Another significant difference between my approach in determining the Fair Value of the \nTransferred Real Estate Assets and Mr. Thomas ’ approach in determining the Market Value of \nthe same is that I place significant evidentiary weight on the NBU’s verified  Fair Values while \nMr. Thomas does not place any on them at all.  The NBU had signed tripartite agreement s with \nthe Bank and third -party valuation firms to conduct the valuation s of the Transferred Assets  \nand the NBU was obviously afforded an opportunity to review such valuations .19   \n56. In my First Expert Report dated 24 January 2022, I explained my  experience in disp utes \ninvolving bank failures, restructurings, and privatizations.

In my First Expert Report dated 24 January 2022, I explained my  experience in disp utes \ninvolving bank failures, restructurings, and privatizations.  Almost all of my work  in this regard  \nhas been for the state and/or the bank regulators in these matters.  For example, I have been \nretained by and worked with bank regulators on such  matters in the Czech Republic \n(concerning every major bank restructuring in the country), Bulgaria, Cyprus, Sweden, Peru, \nand South Korea.  I have also worked with shareholders on such matters in the Slovak Republic, the Russian Federation, Serbia, and Ar gentina.   \n57. In my experience, bank regulators  take a very involved and serious role in the restructuring of \ninsolvent banks, particularly with respect to those like PrivatBank that are systemically \nimportant to the entire banking sector.  I would therefore expect the NBU to scrutinize  the \nvaluation of the Transferred Assets carefully to ensure that the Bank was fulfilling the \nRestructuring Plan by acquiring  UAH 31.13 billion of assets to improve its capital adequacy \nratios (i.e., its primary solvency ratio).   \n58. Mr. Thomas appears to take the view that the NBU’s  verified  Fair Values for the se three \nTransferred Real Estate Assets were not the result of a serious  and involved process .  Mr. \nThomas s uggests the NBU merely “received” the third -party valuation report s prepared for the \n \n19 EY Report, p. 13.  \nD24/1/22\nPage 22 \n purpose of acquiring the Transferred A ssets and improving the Bank’s capital adequacy ratio  \nunder the Restructuring Plan and did not verify them . 20 \n59. I would be very surprised if that had in fact been the case, and I do not believe that it was.  T he \nNBU “ verified ” Fair Values for all three Transferred Real Estate Assets that Mr. Thomas and \nI have been instructed to value.  All of the Fair Values verified by the NBU correspond to  \nvaluation conclusions reached by independent valuer s commissioned under tripartite \nagreement s for the Transferred Real Estate Asset s.  For the Dnipro Stadium, the NBU verified  \na Fair Value of UAH 1,544 million corresponding to a  valuation report prepared by Veritas .  \nVeritas implemented  the Cost Approach to value the Dnipro Stadium .21  For the Training \nCenter, the NBU v erified  a Fair Value of UAH 332 million corresponding to a  valuation report \nalso prepared by Veritas .  Veritas  also implemented the Cost Approach to value the Training \nCenter .22  For the Airfield, the NBU verified  a Fair Value of UAH 34 million corresponding \nto a valuation report prepared by Kreston.23  Kreston also implemented the Cost Approach to \nvalue the Airfield .24 \n60. My review of Ms. Rozhkova’s witness statements confirms both my experience and \nexpectations of the seriousness with which a bank regulator would oversee the valuation of \nassets incorporated into Bank’s  balance sheet to facilitate a restructuring plan for an allegedly \ninsolvent bank, particularly a systemically important bank like PrivatBank.   \n61.

It appears to be common ground that the values initially recognized by the Bank for the re al \nestate assets was U AH 7,379 million.25  However, the values for Dnipro Office and Hotel Zirka \nwere subsequently amended in mid -2016.  Table 5 below shows the details of the initial values \nrecognized by the Bank and as amended with updated values for the Dnipro Office and Hot el \nZirka.  \nTable 5 - Fair Values a t Initial Recognition and as Amended  \n \n63. It is also common ground that the values as set out on the right hand side of Table 5 above are \nthe values that were reflected in the Bank’s year end 2016 financial statements.26  I have two  \ncomments on Table 5 above. \n64. First, all of the initial values were derived from valuation reports prepared by UCE with valuation dates in 2015.  Indeed, some of the valuation dates are as early as the first half of 2015.  These valuation dates would be considered too outdated for inclusion in the 2016 financial statements.   The valuations for all 7 Real Estate Assets needed to be updated in 2016 \nfor inclusion in the balance sheet of the Bank.  All Fair Value calculations in the balance sheet need to be updated regularly to reflect unrecognized gains or losses in the income statement . \n65. Second, as noted above, only two valuations were updated in relation  to the Dnipro Office and \nHotel Zirka.   However, updated 2016 valuation r eports were prepared for all seven Transferred \nReal Estate Asset s in mid -2016 under tripartite agreements between the valuers, the Bank, and \n \n25 See Report of Mark Bezant on Transferred Assets , 24 November 2021 , Table 3.2 . \n26 See Letter of Instruction to Mark Bezant, ¶ 5.5(a) .

I note that EY replaced PwC as the auditor of the Bank in late \n2016 during the period of the Bank’s nationalization.   \n67.

However, given that sufficient and appropriate audit evidence was available in the form of the \nupdated 2016 Fair Value calculations and the approval of those values by the NBU , it was \ninappropriate for the Bank to leave outdated Fair Va lue calculations in its accounts.  \n69. The Bank did not address the qualified audit opinion on the 2016 financial statements until \n2019 when it commissioned new valuers to restate the 2016 Fair Values.  It is unclear to me \nwhy the Bank did not use the updated 2016 valuation reports prepared in mi d-2016 under \ntripartite agreements  to rectify the matter prior to 2019. \n70. Mr. Thomas also does not accept a s reasonable or valid the updated 2016 Fair Value \ncalculations verified by NBU.  Instead, Mr. Thomas places greater evidentiary weight on the \nrestated 2016 Fair Value  measurements commissioned by the Bank as part of the 31 December \n2018 financial statement preparation process.     \n71. The restated 2016 Fair Value measurements for th e Transferred Real Estate Assets being \naddressed by Mr. Thomas are all substantially lower than the updated 2016 Fair Value calculations verified by the  NBU.   The restated 2016 Fair Value measurements for the \nTransferred Real Estate Assets being addressed by Mr. Thomas also utilized a different \nvaluation technique  (i.e., the Income Approach) compared with the valuation techniques \nutilized by the original independent valuation firms (i.e., the Cost Approach) and approved by \nthe NBU.  While the Cost Approach and Income Approach may yield materially different Fair \nValue measurements (an issue I will address more specifically in Section VI below), it is my \nopinion that the independent valuation firms retained by the Bank in 2018 to re state the Fair \nValue of the Transferred Real Estate Assets as at 31 December 2016, either wrongly adopted \nthe Income Approach or utilized flawed input parameters in implementing the Income Approach.  I discuss my criticisms of the restated 2016 Fair Value measurements in Section \nVIII below.    \n72.

Bezant) or EY’s unqualified \nopinion on those measurements.  There are other factors that call into question the reliability \nof the EY audit which I will address in Section VIII.  \n Comments on Mr. Thomas’ Rejection of the Cost Approach \n73. In the PTBK  JS, Mr. Thomas opines that the Cost Approach is not a valid technique to \ndetermine the Market Value or Fair Value of the Transferred Real Estate Assets : \n“Mr Thomas is of the view that the Cost Approach is not an \nappropriate valuation approach for determining the market value of \nincome generating assets .”29 \n74. Merely because an asset generates income does not negate the use of the Cost Approach to \ndetermine either Market Value or Fair Value.   Specifically, IFRS 13 states: \n“An entity shall use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the \ncircumstances and f or which sufficient data are available to measure \nfair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and \nminimising the use of unobservable inputs.”30 \n75. Thus, the technique to be utilized should be appropriate in the valuer’s judgement and \nsufficient data should be available to implement the  technique.    IFRS 13 does not state the \nCost Approach is inapplicable because the asset is income generating.  Speci fically, IFRS 13 \nrecognizes that a willing buyer would not pay more for an asset than the cost to construct a substitute asset . \n“From the perspective of a market participant seller, the price that \nwould be received for the asset is based on the cost to a m arket \nparticipant buyer to acquire or construct a substitute asset of \ncomparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence. That is because a \nmarket participant buyer would not pay more for an asset than the amount for which it could replace the service capacity of that \nasset.”\n31 \n76. As such, it is often beneficial to  incorporate the Cost Approach into a valuation analysis and \ncompare the value obtained by the Cost Approach against the value obtained from  \n \n29 PTBK JS, ¶ 7.6. \n30 EY, “Applying IFRS: IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement,” November 2012, ¶ 61.

Unfortunately, w hile all valuation practitioners \nwould prefer sufficient data be available to reliably implement all relevant valuation \ntechniques, this situation often does not present itself.  \n77. To demonstrate how the Cost Approach and other valuation techniques would be analyzed \ntogether, it is instructive to consider two scenarios.  \n78. First, if the value obtained from the Income Approach yields a value materially higher  than the  \nvalue obtained from the Cost Approach, logic would dictate that the willing buyer would not \npay more for the asset than the value obtained under the Cost Approach.  In essence, if the willing buyer could construct a substitute asset  more cheaply  than purchasing a similar existing \nasset, the buyer would logically prefer to pay the less er amount.   \n79.

In essence, if the willing buyer could construct a substitute asset  more cheaply  than purchasing a similar existing \nasset, the buyer would logically prefer to pay the less er amount.   \n79.

This latter situation often arises where an asset has not been utilized at its highest and \nbest use and the seller is  aware the asset has a higher and b etter use.   \n80. Thus, the Cost Approach can be a very important valuation technique for a valuer to consider \nin determining Fair Value in many circumstances where the asset  being valued is one that could \nbe replicated by a buyer through the construction of a similar asset .  Moreover, when \ninsufficient data exists to implement either the Market or Income Approaches, the Cost \nApproach would be the most appropriate valuation te chnique given the logic outlined in my \ntwo scenarios above.           \n81. As I will discuss in Section VII below, Veritas determined that there was insufficient data to \nimplement the Income Approach for the Dnipro Stadium and Training Center.   I agree with \nthat assessment , particular ly given the fact that the Dnipro Stadium and Tr aining Center were \nseparated from the FC Dni pro Club. \n82. I am also of the view that Mr. Thomas’ position is belied by the EY Report.  Specifically, the EY Report states that the Cost Appro ach is the preferred valuation technique for the Dnipro \nStadium and Training Center.  \nD24/1/28\nPage 28 \n “Based on the generally accepted practice and approaches to valuing \nthis type of asset, EY is of the view that the cost approach with an \nasset impairment test should be us ed as the primary basis for this \nvaluation.”32 \n83. Mr. Thomas  identifies what appear s to be contradictory statements made by EY i n its report  \nregarding the use of the Cost Approa ch in the summary portion of its report.  \n“In our view, this value calculation must include an income \napproach, as the cost approach does not capture the property’s true market value in this case. Lacking data on the training base’s performance (income, expenses), we are unable to comment on this asset as part of our desk  review. We recommend a revaluation. ”\n33 \n84. I have been aware of th is apparently  contradictory statement .  However, EY did not expressly \nreject the Cost Approach.  EY stated that the value calculation should also include the Income \nApproach.  However, I do not  know how  EY could logically opine that the Cost Approach \ndoes not capture the property’s true market value without knowing the results of the Income Approach.  More importantly, however, EY acknowledged that data pertaining  to the potential \nincome and expenses of the Transferred Assets was not available to implement the Income  \nApproach.  Furthermore , I am of the view that no better data has been obtained or presented \nsubsequent to the Original 2016 Fair Value calculations to reliably implement the Income \nApproach, either by the valuers appointed by the Bank in 2019 to calculate the R estated 2016 \nFair Values or by Mr. Thom as in this litigation . \n85.  As a final matter,  the Fair Values for the Transferred Real Estate Assets, as approved by the \nNBU,  were derived from the work of independent third -party  valuations , each of which  \nfeatured  the Cost Appro ach in its analysis.

Two such \nvaluation reports were prepared for each of the three Transferred R eal Estate Assets discussed \nin this First Supplemental R eport, namely the  Dnipro Stadium, the Training Cent er and the \nAirfield .  Table  7 below includes summary information on each of these six reports.  \nTable 7 – Summary Information: 2015/2016 Valuation Reports35  \n \n87. Table 7 indicates that the Fair Values initially  recorded by the Bank, which are the same as \nthose pleaded by the First Defendant in this matter, are based on the value conclusions reached \nby UCE in reports prepared in 2015 with valuation dates in 2015.  Table  7 above also indicates \nthat none of the value conclusions set out in the UCE reports was approved by the NBU .  \nInstead, the NBU approved values which match those set out in the 2016 reports authored by \nVeritas  with respect to the Dnipro Stadium and the Training Center and by Kreston with respect \nto the Airfield  under t ripartite agreements .  In Section IV above , I explain the reasons why the \nvalues approved by the NBU under tripartite agreement s are reasonable and compliant \nmeasures of  Fair Value of the Dnipro Stadium, Training Center and Airfield as of 31 December \n2016. \n88. When considering the Fair Value of the Dnipro Stadium and Training Center, one must consider that these assets were p reviously owned and operated by the First Defendant as part \nof the Football Club D nipro (i.e., “FC D nipro”)  as is typical for many  European football club \nowners .  The transfer of the Dnipro Stadium and the Training Center to the Bank sepa rated \nthese assets from FC Dnipro, thereby creating a new operating structure for the club  and these \nassets  that previously did not exist.  For example, FC Dnipro would now be required to pay for \n \n34 See, e.g., Kaczmarek I, ¶¶ 240 -241. \n35 Kaczmarek I, Sections VII.E -VII.G.

When assessing competing valuation conclusions reached by different independent valuers , I \nconsider that differences in valuation results obtained using the same technique can generally \nbe categorized into three groups: 1) differences in parameters where one professional uses an \nobservable market -based input and the other professional does not .  In this case, the latter \nprofessional can be faulted for committing an error in the valuation analysis ; 2) differences in \nunobservable inputs utilized by two professionals where one professional’s parameter is more logical or defensible than the other.   In this situation, the former professional’s parameter \nshould be preferred;  3) differences in unobservable inputs utilized by two professionals where \nboth parameters appear to have merit.  This last situation is best characterized as reasonable \nprofessional disagreement.  \n90. In the remainder of this section, I discuss in greater detail the valuation approach, assumptions, and conclusions set out in the six reports identified in Table 7 above  and confirm that the values \napproved by the NBU are based on the independent valuation reports prepared by \nVeritas/Kreston that incorporate appropriate valuation techniques and reasonable assumptions . \nA. Dnipro Stadium  \n91. Two valuation reports were issued prior to 31 December 2016.  First, UCE issued a report on \n16 December  2015 (“UCE Stadium Report”), using a valuation date of 14 December 2015.\n36  \nSecond, Veritas issued a report on 18 August 2016 (“Veritas Stadium Report”) that valued the Dnipro Stadium as of 30 June 2016.\n37  These two reports are discussed below in turn.  \ni. UCE  Stadium Report  \n92. UCE ’s valuation was prepared approximately six months pri or to the Dnipro Stadium’s \ntransfer to the Bank in June 2016.  The UCE Stadium Report indicates that it was prepared using the market value standard.\n38  UCE correctly identified the three valuation techniques \nrecognized  by both the IVS 2013 and IFRS 13 guidelines : the Cost Approach, the I ncome \n \n36 IK0008209_0001 , p. 2.  \n37 PB0150859_00001, p. 1.  \n38 IK0008209_0001 , p. 6.  \nD24/1/31\nPage 31 \n Approach, and the M arket Approach.39  UCE determined that the Income  Approach should not \nbe used to value the Dnipro Stadium:  \n“The income approach allows to determine the value of the \nvaluation object as the present value of  expected income from the \nmost effective use of the valuation object. Rent, which is relatively \nstable over  time and provides equal cash flow, may be the main \nsource of income generated by the valuation object. Due to the lack \nof data on the lea se of similar facilities, this approach has not been \napplied. ”40 \n93.  Therefore,  UCE  valued the Dnipro Stadium using a combination of the Cost Approach and \nthe Market Approach.41  Following the selection of valuation techniques, UCE then opined \nthat the highest and best use of  the Dnipro Stadium was as office space.42  UCE used the Cost \nApproach to value  the structural or exterior elements of the Stadium complex .43  UCE \nidentified 7 7 such elements , which were valued b y reference to the reproduction  cost per unit \n(either m2 or m3).44  \n94.

UCE determined a total value for the exterior and structural elements of UAH 127.4 million.  \nOf this total, the most valuable elements include the Stadium stands  (UAH 42 .6 million) , the \nstand roof (UAH 30.9 million) and the paved concourse (UAH  28.9 million).48 \n97. The Cost Approach requires that the value of land be added to the depreciated replacement \ncost of real estate improvements.  UCE  valued the land by reference to three land plots  it \ndeemed to be comparable to the land on which the Dnipro Stadium was constructed.  UCE determined a median unit cost of UAH  6,533 per m\n2.49  Following a series of assumptions \nregarding the capitalization rate for land , taxes to which the land would be s ubject , the discount \nrate, and the assumed period of land use rights , UCE concluded that the rights to use the land \nunderlying the Dnipro Stadium had a value of UAH 242.7 million.50  UCE then added the \nvalue of the land use rights to the depreciated  replac ement cost of the structural and exterior \nstadium elements and reached a value co nclusion of UAH 370.1 million for those portions of \nthe Stadium complex.51 \n98. The interior space of buildings located in the Stadium complex were valued using the Market \nApproach.  UCE identified  35 spaces, includ ing the VIP building, police command post, \nlavatory buildings, mechanical rooms and cafeterias, with a total area of 15,850.4 m2 to be \nvalued using the Market Approach.52  UCE then identified four real estate objects it deemed \ncomparable  to the interior spaces of the Dnipro Stadium.  Eleven adjustments were made to \nthe asking prices for those four properties .  Th ose adjustments are summarized in Table 8 \nbelow. \n \n46 I note that the UCE Stadium Report appears to present unit costs in Russian Rubles but indicates that the outputs of \nits replacement cost calculations are in UAH. It is not clear from the UCE Stadium Report if or where a currency \nconversion is present in UCE’s calculations.  \n47 IK0008209_0001 , p. 46.  \n48 IK0008209_0001 , pp. 48 -54. \n49 IK0008209_0001 , p. 55.  \n50 IK0008209_0001 , pp. 56 -57. \n51 IK0008209_0001 , p. 57.  \n52 IK0008209_0001 , pp. 57 -58. \nD24/1/33\nPage 33 \n Table 8 – Adjustments to Comparable Properties, UCE Stadium Report  \n \n99.

For example , UCE considered that the location of the Dnipro Stadium’s interior spaces on the \ngrounds of the Stadium was less desirable than the comparable properties ’ locations on city \nstreets.   Therefore, a downward adjustment was made to the price of the comparable properties.  \nOn the other hand, UCE judged the Dnipro Stadium’s utilities and interior condition to be \nsuperior to those of the comparable properties, ne cessitating upward adjustments.  For five of \nthe eleven factors, UCE was of the opinion that the interior space of the Dnipro Stadium was \nequivalent to the comparable properties, and thus used an adjustment factor of 1.0.  Following the eleven adjustments shown in Table 8 above , UCE concluded that  the unit price for property \ncomparable to the interior space of the Dnipro Stadium was US$ 3,034/m\n2.53  This unit price \nwas applied to an area of 15,850.4 m2, the combined area  of the interior spaces of the Stadium , \nwith the result converted to UAH using the prevailing exchange rate on the valuation date.  \nUCE’s  value conclusion for the Stadium’s interior spaces, using the Market Approach, was \nUAH 1,147.4  million .54  UCE added this  resul t to its calculation of the structural and exterior \nelements of the stadium and underlying land, determined using the Cost Approach, yielding  a \ntotal value conclusion for the Dnipro Stadium of UAH 1,517.5  million , as summarized in Table \n9 below.55 \n \n53 IK0008209_0001 , p. 63.  \n54 IK0008209_0001 , p. 63.  \n55 IK0008209_0001 , p. 66.  #Adjustment Factor Adjustment Value\n1Location 1.0\n2Building Type 1.0-1.2\n3Location on Block 0.95\n4Access to Premises 1.0\n5Functional Purpose 1.0\n6Building Area 0.975-0.982\n7Utilities 1.0-1.2\n8Interior Condition 1.0-1.3\n9Additional Conditions 1.0\n10 Improvements 1.0\n11Discount to List Price 0.95\nD24/1/34\nPage 34 \n Table 9 – Summary of Value Conclusion – UCE Stadium Report  \n \n100. While the value conclusion set out in the UCE Stadium Report was the basis for the initial  \nFair Value of the Dnipro Stadium in the Bank ’s financial statements, this  value was  not \napproved by the NBU  in its role as the overseer of the restructuring program.  There are at least \nthree potential reasons why  the NBU likely  chose not to rely on the UCE valuation.  First, the \nUCE Stadium report was prepared well before the date of asset transfer and the NBU more \nthan likely preferred a more current valuation .  Second, the sources of UCE’s  assumptions are \nnot fully transparent . For example, UCE d id not clearly explain how it det ermined which \nelements should be valued using the Cost Approach and which should be valued using the \nMarket Approach .  Similarly, it did not explain the source of the index used to adjust for \nchanges in construction materials price levels o r the source of its assumption regarding \ndepreciation.  Third, UCE does not clearly explain why it has assumed that the highest and \nbest use of the Dnipro Stadium was  as office space for rent, rather than as a football stadium.  \nFor these reasons, I do not find it surprising that the NBU chose to approve a value taken from the Veritas Stadium Report which I disc uss next.  \nii. Veritas Stadium Report \n101. In contrast to the UCE Stadium Report, the Veritas Stadium Report was prepared in August \n2016 and valued the Dnipro Stadium as of J une 2016, the month in which it was transferred to \nthe Bank.  Veritas indicates that the purpose of the valuation  was “determining the market \nvalue of the valuation object in order to pledge it to the National Bank of Ukraine.”\n56  \nFurthermore, Veritas indicated that it adopted  the I VS guidelines on Market Value when \nconducting its valuation analysis.57 \n102.

Dnipro- Arena has a purely  football configuration. \nTherefore, the use of the valuation object is limited by its \nspecifications. The use of  the valuation object for other purposes \nrequires significant capital expenditures on reconstruction of the  \nstadium, wh ich is not feasible …  \nHaving analyzed all circumstances related to the Valuation Object, \nits location, condition, lack of restrictive conditions, as well as \npossible profitability and social significance, the Appraiser \nconcluded that the current use of ass ets is the highest.”58  \n103. Veritas next considered the three valuation techniques recognized under both the IVS and \nIFRS 13  guidelines : the Income Approach, the Market Approach and the Cost Approach.   \nVeritas dismissed the use of the Market Approach due to a lack of transaction data available \nfor the purchase and sale of football stadiums .59 Veritas did not use the Income Approach for \ntwo reasons.  First, Veritas noted that the income approach  would be difficult to implement:  \n“Application of income approach in this Report is extremely time \nconsuming, as many different  peculiarities and details typical of \nfootball stadiums must be taken into account, and finally, any forecasting  of future cash flows requires many assumptions and \nconsideration of numer ous scenarios with different  probability of \ntheir implementation. ”\n60 \n104.   Second, Veritas  observed the difficulties of accounting for the social and indirect economic \nconsequences of the  Stadium’s use in the I ncome Approach.61 \n105. Having dismissed the Market and Income Approaches, Veritas proceeded to value the Dnipro \nStadium using only the Cost Approach. \n“Having analyzed potential application of the three approaches to \nvaluation, we can state that the cost  approach, which most accurately \nreflects the specifics of  a particular sports infrastructure and takes \n \n58 PB0150859_00001, p. 27.  \n59 PB0150859_00001, p. 28.  \n60 PB0150859_00001, p. 28.  \n61 PB0150859_00001, p. 28.  \nD24/1/36\nPage 36 \n into account its unique parameters, is the most appropriate and \naccurate method for valuation of a football  stadium. ”62 \n106. Veritas explain ed that the  implementation of the Cost Approach requires the valuer to \ndetermine the  reconstruction or replacement value of  the valuation object, the accumulated \ndepreciation to be deducted from the replacement value, and the value of the land plot \nunderlying the valuation object.  Veritas summarized the Cost Approach using the formula \nshown in Figure 2 below:  \nFigure 2 -  Cost Approach Formula – Veritas Stadium Report63 \n \n107. Veritas summarized the three methodologies  typically used to calculate the replacement or \nreconstruction value of a real estate asset.  The first is the comparative method, which makes \nuse of typical costs per unit of area or volume.

Th is first methodology is the one used in the \nUCE Stadium Report , as discussed in the prior subsection .  The second methodology uses \nmarket prices for supplies and services to estimate the cost of reconstructing the components of the valuation object.  Final ly, the third methodology begins with the historical construction \ncost of a real estate asset and updates that cost to the valuation date by adjusting for changes \nin price levels between the date of construction and the valuation date.\n64  Veritas considered \nthis third methodology to be the most appropriate way to estimate the cost of re placing the \nstadium as of June 2016.65   \n108. In order to establish the costs incurred to construct the Dnipro Stadium, Veritas reviewed \nhistorical cost data in formation taken from general contractor agreements, equipment supply \ncontracts  and accounting data related to construction operations  and equipment deliveries .66  \n \n62 PB0150859_00001, p. 29.  \n63 PB0150859_00001, p. 29.  \n64 PB0150859_00001, p. 30.  \n65 PB0150859_00001, p. 30.  \n66 PB0150859_00001, pp. 31, 37.  \nD24/1/37\nPage 37 \n Veritas divided the cost of reproduction into two components: 1) the reconstruction of real \nestate items and 2) the reproduction of equipment.67  For real estate items, Veritas updated the \noriginal construction costs incurred in 2007 and 2008 to the valuation date using an index that \ntracked the market value of construction and installation operations published by the Ministry \nof Regional Development.68  This index is reproduced in part in Table 10 below.  \nTable 10 – Construction  Price Index  – Veritas Stadium Report  \n \n109. For example, a construction cost of UAH 1 million incurred in January 2007 would be \nupdated to the June 2016 valuation date by multiplying the original amount by a factor of 3.7, \nresulting in a corresponding reproduction cost of UAH 3.7 million.  Veritas  reviewed 52 cost \nreports related to real estate construction , covering the period between January 2007 and \nSeptember 2008.69  These documents  indicated that UAH 334 .2 million was spent related to \nreal estate construction in 2007 and 2008.  After updating each cost element to the June 2016 \nvaluation date, Veritas concluded that the cost to reconstruct the real estate  portions of the \nDnipro Stadium as of the valuation date was UAH 1,125.8 million .70 \n \n67 PB0150859_00001, pp. 32, 37.  \n68 PB0150859_00001, p. 32.  \n69 PB0150859_00001, pp. 32 -36. \n70 PB0150859_00001, p. 36.  \nD24/1/38\nPage 38 \n 110. Next, Veritas considered the cost of reproducing the equipment installed at the Dnipro \nStadium .  Veritas reviewed equipment supply contracts and accounting data  for the period \nbetween December 2006 and January 2016.71  Instead of indexing the original equipment costs \nto the Ministry of Regional Development’s construction cost index, as was done for the real \nestate items, Veritas adjusted the equipment costs using a general Eurozone producer price \nindex.  In addition, Veritas accounted for the devaluation of the UAH against the Euro over \nthe relevant period when updating historical costs to June 2016.72  Table  11 below \ndemonstrates  the manner in which Veritas updated the December 20 06 acquisition of  several  \nair supply unit s to be installed at the Stadium to the valuation date . \nTable 11 – Sample Calculation of Equipment Reproduction Costs73 \n \n111.  After updating all equipment costs to June 2016, Veritas concluded that the reproduction \ncost of equipment installed at the Dnipro Stadium was UAH  275.2 million.74 \n112.

After updating all equipment costs to June 2016, Veritas concluded that the reproduction \ncost of equipment installed at the Dnipro Stadium was UAH  275.2 million.74 \n112. Having calculated the replacement cost of both the real estate items and equipment installed \nat the Dnipro Stadium, Veritas next addressed the accumulated depreciation  that must be \ndeducted from the replacement cost in order to determine the depreciated re placement value \nof the Stadium.   Veritas identified three types of depreciation: 1) physical wear and tear, 2) \nfunctional depreciation, and 3)  external economic depr eciation.  Veritas described these \ncomponents of depreciation as follows:  \n“Physical wear an d tear is deterioration of the initial engineering and \neconomic properties due to the  natural wear of a particular object \nduring operation and under the influence of various natural factors. \nIn other words, it is depreciation of the materials, of which the  object \n \n71 PB0150859_00001, pp. 38 -64. \n72 PB0150859_00001, p. 38.  \n73 PB0150859_00001, p. 38.  \n74 PB0150859_00001, p. 64.  \nD24/1/39\nPage 39 \n is made, the loss of its original qualities,  the gradual destruction of \nstructures, etc.  \nFunctional depreciation is depreciation of the object resulting from \nnon-compliance of its parameters  and/or characteristics with the \noptimal engineering and e conomic level. Both a lack of optimal \nusefulness  and its unused excess can be the cause of functional \ndepreciation. \nExternal (economic) depreciation is the depreciation of property due \nto the influence of external  factors, namely: change in optimal use, \nnew laws, changes in  the relation between supply and demand, \ndeterioration of inputs, skills, etc.”75 \n113. Veritas  relied upon depreciation tables published by Marshall and Swift , a real estate \nanalytics and data firm , to derive its depreciation adjustment.76  Based on an assumed useful \nlife of 50 years and the fact that the Stadium had been in use for eight years as of the valuation \ndate, the Marshall and Swift depreciation table  indicates  total depreciation of 5 percent.77  \nUsing the previously calculated re construction  costs of real estate and  replacement costs for \nequipment  in combination with the 5 percent depreciation adjustment, Veritas calculated a \ndepreciated replacement value for the Dnipro Stadium of UAH 1,331.0 million, as shown in \nTable 12 below. \nTable 12 – Calculation of Depreciated Replacement Cost  – Veritas Stadium Report78 \n \n114. The final element of the Cost Approach involves the valuation of the underlying land use \nrights.  In order to value the usage rights of the land underlying the Stadium, Veritas used a \n \n75 PB0150859_00001, pp. 64 -65. \n76 PB0150859_00001, p. 65.  \n77 PB0150859_00001, p. 66.  \n78 PB0150859_00001, p. 67.  \nD24/1/40\nPage 40 \n methodology very similar to that adopted by UCE and described in the previous subsection.  \nWhereas  UCE selected three  comparable land plots, Veritas used five comparable land plots \noffered for  sale in June 2016.79   Veritas  calculated an initial (i.e., before adjustments) average \nland value of US$ 2.77 million per hectare for the comparable land plots, in line with the US$ 274/m\n2 (US$ 2.74 million per hectare) calculated by UCE.80   \n115. Veritas mad e a number of adjustments to this initial price.  First, Veritas made a 20 percent \ndownward adjustment to account for the difference between list prices and sale prices , reducing \nthe average  sales prices to US$ 2.22 million per hectare.81  Second, Veritas made detailed \nadjustments for the location  of each comparable land plot , assessing proximity to the city \ncenter, accessibility for vehicles, and the nature of the surrounding environment.82  Third, \nVeritas made an adjustment for the size "}

After applying all adjustments, Veritas \ncalculated land values of US$ 2.21 million per hectare for the smaller (0. 79 hectare) land plot \nand US$ 1.79 million per hectare for the larger ( 6.42 hectare plot)  associated with the Dnipro \nStadium .  After multiplying  the unit cost by the land plot area and converting the result to UAH \nat the prevailing exchange rate as of the valuation date, Veritas concluded land values  of UAH \n43.2 million  and UAH 28 5.0 million  for the smaller and larger land plots, respectively.   \n116. The total land value of UAH 328.2 million is then used to determine the value of the land \nuse rights  by incorporating assumptions regarding the capitalization rate, land rent rate , \ndiscount rate , and useful life of the Stadium .  Veritas calculated the value of the usage rights \nfor the two land plots underlying the Stadium to be UAH 213.0 million .84  This land use rights \nvalue is 12 percent lower than the value of the land use rights  calculated by UCE, as the \ndownward effects of  Veritas’s larger discount f or bargaining (20 percent versus 5 percent for \nUCE) and lower capitalization rate (7. 0 percent versus 8.7 percent for UCE) are largely offset \n \n79 PB0150859_00001, p. 71.  \n80 PB0150859_00001, p. 71; IK0008209_0001, p. 55.

After adding the value of the underlying land rights to the depreciated replacement cost of \nthe real estate and equipment  elements of the Stadium , Veritas reached a value conclusion of \nUAH 1,544 million for the Dnipro Stadium using the Cost Approach as shown in Table 13 \nbelow.85   \nTable 13 – Summary of Value Conclusion – Veritas Stadium Report  \n \n118. The Veritas valuation appears to me  to be a robust and well supported implementation of the \nCost Approach.  While I, or any other valuer, might have made different assumptions than \nthose included in the Veritas Stadium Report, nothing in my review suggests that the \nparameters used  by Veritas are unreasonable.   \n119. Given the transparent nature of Veritas’s methodology and assumptions, along with the \nproximity of Veritas’s valuation date to the date of transfer, I find it unsurprising that the NBU \npreferred the analysis of Veritas to th at of UCE  in approving a value of UAH 1,544 million for \nthe Dnipro Stadium.    \n120. Finally , the Veritas Stadium Report maximizes the use of observable inputs, namely the \nactual historical costs incurred to construct the Stadium as well as published cost index \nadjustments , while the UCE Stadium Report does not.

UCE  Training Center Report  \n122. UCE’s valuation was prepared approximately 13 months prior to the Dnipro Stadium’s \ntransfer to the Bank in June 2016.  In its valuation of the Training Center, UCE adopted a \nmethodology similar to the one it used to value the Dnipro Stadium in the UCE Stad ium \nReport.  UCE ’s analysis wa s conducted under the Market Value standard and UCE \nimplemented  both the Cost and Market Approach es.88  UCE’s rationale for dismissing the \nIncome Approach was identical to the reasoning given in the UCE Stadium Report.89 \n123. Howev er, I identified two differences between  the approaches UCE used to value the Dnipro \nStadium and the Training Center.  First, w hereas UCE viewed the highest and best use of the \nDnipro Stadium as office space, UCE assumed that the current use of the Training Center, as a training base for a football team, was its highest and best use.\n90  Second, UCE ’s method of \ndivision of the Training Center’s  real estate elements  between those valued using the Cost \nApproach and those valued using the Market Approach differe d from the method used to divide \nthe real estate elements of the Dnipro Stadium.  Specifically, UCE  divided the Stadium into \nexternal and internal elements , valuing the former using the Cost Approach and the latter using \nthe Market Approach.  For the Training Center, however  UCE divided the real estate assets \naccording to the physical address of the assets.  The real estate assets located at 12 Pionerskyi \nLane, w hich included the indoor football field and its immediate surroundings, were valued \nusing the Cost Approach.91  The remainder of the Training Center Complex, located at 14 \nPionerskyi Lane, was valued using the Market Approach.92 \n124. In order to value the  real estate located at 12 Pionerskyi Lane  under the Cost Approach,  UCE \nagain adopted a unit -based cost estimation methodology:  \n \n86 IK0007550_0001 , p. 2.  \n87 PB0354177_00001, p. 3.  \n88 IK0007550_0001 , p. 2.  \n89 IK0007550_0001 , p. 35.  \n90 IK0007550_0001 , p. 36-37. \n91 IK0007550_0001 , p. 56.  \n92 IK0007550_0001 , pp. 52 -56. \nD24/1/43\nPage 43 \n “Valuation of the real estate within the framework of the cost \napproach was carried out at the value of a single indicator of a \nconstr uction analogue.

To carry out this methodology, UCE used the same basic formula set out in Figure 2 above .  \nUCE used the same depreciation adjustment (5 percent) and the same escalation factor  for \nconstruction materials (1.1934) that it did when valuing the Dnipro Stadium .

Next, UCE calculated  the value of the rights to use the land plot located at 12 Pionerskyi \nLane.

In order to value the portion of the Training Center located at 14 Pionerskyi Lane, UCE used \nthe Market Approach  and foll owed the same process used when valuing the interior elements \nof the Dnipro Stadium.  First, UCE identified 159 real estate objects within the relevant portion \nof the Training Center with a combined area of 13,062.6 m2.98  Second, UCE selected three \ncomparable properties offered for sale in the Dnipro area, two of which were water sports bases \nwhile the third was a recreation center.99  UCE made adjustments to the l ist prices to account \nfor differences in location, materials used, funct ional purpose , area of the land plot, utilities, \ntechnical condition, and the area of the premises.  UCE considered, but did not make \nquantitative adjustments for , security availability and the ratio of the sales price to the ask \nprice.100  Following the af orementioned adjustments, UCE calculated an average sale price of \nUS$ 1,883/m2 for the comparable properties.  This unit price was applied to an area of 1 3,062.6  \nm2, the combined area of the real estate objects located at 14 Pionerskyi Lane , and the result \nwas converted to UAH using the prevailing exchange rate on the valuation date. UCE’s value \nconclusion for the portion of the Training Center located at 14 Pionerskyi Lane , using the \nMark et Approach, was UAH 578.3 million .101  UCE added this result to its valuation of the \nportion of the Training Center located at 12 Pionerskyi Lane , determined using the Cost \nApproach, yielding a total value conclusion for the Training Center of UAH 670.5 mi llion.102 \n128. While the value conclusion set out in the UCE Training Center Report was the basis for the \ninitial Fair Value of the Training Center in the Bank’s financial statements, this value was not approved by the NBU in its role as the overseer of the restructuring program.  In my view, there are at least three  likely reasons why the NBU chose not to rely on th e UCE valuation.   \n129. First, the UCE Training Center report was prepared well before the date of asset transfer and \nthe NBU likely preferred a more current valuation.   \n \n97 IK0007550_0001 , p. 42.  \n98 IK0007550_0001 , pp. 43 -47. \n99 IK0007550_0001 , p. 49.  \n100 IK0007550_0001 , pp. 50 -51. \n101 IK0007550_0001 , p. 5"}

Second, the sources of UCE’s assumptions are not fully transparent. For example, UCE did \nnot clearly explain the logic supporting its deci sion to value the Training Center in two piece s, \nusing the Cost Approach for one property and the Market Approach  for the other.  Similarly, \nUCE  did not explain the source of the index used to adjust for changes in construction materials \nprice levels o r the source of its assumption regarding depreciation.   \n131. Third, UCE does not sufficiently explain on what basis it considers the  properties selected  \nfor use in its Market Approach to be sufficiently comparable to the Training Center.  I note \nthat the Training Center is 10- 20 times larger, in terms of the area of real estate o bjects , and up \nto 100 times larger, in total land area, compared to the  selec ted properties , yet UCE’s \nadjustments for these size differences are minimal .103  \n132. For these reasons, I do not find it surprising that the NBU chose to approve the Veritas \nTraining Center Report which I discuss next.  \nii. Veritas Training Center Report  \n133.  In contra st to the UCE Training Center Report, the Veritas Training Center Report was \nprepared in August 2016 and valued the Training Center  as of June 2016, the month in which \nit was transferred to the Bank.  Veritas’s approach and methodology used in valuing the \nTraining Center mirror those used  in its valuation of the Dnipro Stadium.   Veritas conducted \nits assessment under the Market Value standard and used only the Cost Approach to value the \nTraining Center.104 \n134. When determining the highest and best use of the Training Center, Veritas noted th at the \nTraining Center is a “special -purpose  real estate item.”105  Therefore , Veritas concluded that it \nwas not economically feasible to use it for any other purpose and that its current use, as a \nfootball training facility , was its highest and best use.106  Due to the status of the Training \nCenter, Veritas expressed the opinion that the income approach could not be applied.  \n“It is impossible to use the income approach in this case because \nTraining ground was developed not fo r profit purposes, therefore, \nthe concept of its design is based on the values that would meet the  \n \n103 IK0007550_0001 , pp. 50 -51. \n104 PB0354177_00001 _English , p. 3.  \n105 PB0354177_00001 _English , p. 41.  \n106 PB0354177_00001 _English , p. 42.  \nD24/1/46\nPage 46 \n achievement of the club's sports goals. \nThe property being valued is classified as a specialised asset with \nlimited market for sale and lease. Training grou nds for training of \nfootball players of leading Ukrainian football clubs cannot be regarded as profitable property, because the purpose of such sports complexes is to train players of leading Ukrainian football clubs, but \nnot gain profits by leasing proper ties.”\n107 \n135. Furthermore, Veritas rejected the Market Approach due to a lack of transactions involving  \nfootball training centers in Ukraine.108  Therefore, Veritas expressed the op inion that only the \nCost Approach could be used to value the Training Center.  \n“Having analyzed potential application of the three approaches to \nvaluation, we can state that the cost  approach, which most accurately \nreflects the specifics of a particular sports infrastructure and takes \ninto account its unique parameters, is the most appropriate and \naccurate method for valuation of the Training  Cente"}

In its application  of the Cost Approach, Veritas made use  of two of the three replacement \ncost estimation methodologies described in Section VI.A above.  First, where information was \navailable regarding the historical costs  of each component of the Training Center, that \nhistorical cost information was used to estimate the corresponding replacement cost as of the \nvaluation date.  Veritas reviewed cost data from general contractor agreem ents and accounting \ndata related to construction operations.110  These costs were adjusted using the same price \nindex published by the Ukrainian Ministry of Regional Development and Construction shown \nabove in Table 10.111   \n137. Where historical cost information  was not available, Veritas relied on unit cost data taken \nfrom various sources, including government publications and Ukrainian websites that either \ntracked construction costs or offered  similar objects for sale .112  For cost estimates made as of \n2016, no adjustments were necessary. For those costs estimated at a historical date, adjustments \nwere made to account for increases in the prices of construction materials and services between \n \n107 PB0354177_00001 _English , p. 43.  \n108 PB0354177_00001 _English , p. 43.  \n109 PB0354177_00001 _English , p. 43.  \n110 PB0354177_00001 _English , p. 48.  \n111 PB0354177_00001 _English , pp. 48 -49. \n112 PB0354177_00001_English , pp. 55- 60. The central column in the Table on pp.  55-60, labeled “ Information \nSource” indicates the website or government publication from which cost estimate s were taken.  \nD24/1/47\nPage 47 \n the date of measurement and the v aluation date.  The adjusted unit cost, typically expressed in \nUAH/m2 or UAH/m3, was then multiplied by the area or volume of the corresponding element .   \n138. Next , costs incurred to finance the construction were added.  Veritas calculated financing \ncosts as 26 percent of the replacement cost , based on average real estate lending rates published \nby the NBU.113   \n139. The final ste p in calculating the depreciated replacement cost of the Training  Center applied \nby Veritas was an adjustment for phys ical, functional, and economic depreciation.  Like it did \nwhen valuing the Dnipro Stadium, Veritas use d depreciation tables published by Mar shall and \nSwift to  estimate the degree of depreciation appli cable to the Training Center.  While Veritas \nused a single depreciation adjustment of 5 percent when valuing the Dnipro Stadium, they \nderive d independent depreciation adjustments for each of the 165 real estate objects that make \nup the Training Center.  Ve ritas’s depreciation adjustments range from 3 percent, applied to \ncertain newer elements with long expected useful lives, to 40 percent, applied to older elements or those with relatively shorter useful lives.\n114  Using these depreciation adjustments, Verit as \ncalculated the depreciated replacement cost of improvements to the Training Center  to be UAH \n305.9 million.115   \n140. The final element of the Cost Approach involves the valuation of the underlying land use \nrights.  In order to value the usage rights of the l and underlying the Stadium, Veritas used a \nmethodology identical to that used in its valuation of the usage rights associated with the land underlying the Dnipro Stadium .  Veritas used f our comparable land plots offered for sale in \nJune 2016.\n116   Veritas calculated an initial (i.e., before adjustments) average land value of US$ \n0.21 mill"}

Veritas then made a number of adj ustments to this initial value .  First, Veritas made a 10  \npercent downward adjustment to account for the difference between list prices and sale prices, reducing the average sales prices to US$ 0.19  million per hectare.\n118  Second, Veritas made \n \n113 PB0354177_00001 _English , p. 46.  \n114 PB0354177_00001 _English , p. 5 2-54. \n115 PB0354177_00001 _English , p. 60. \n116 PB0354177_00001 _English , p. 6 4. \n117 PB0354177_00001 _English , p. 6 4; IK0007550_0001 , p. 40.

After applying all adjustments, \nVeritas calculated land values of US$ 0.18 million per hectare for the smaller ( 2.7 hectare) \nland plot and US$ 0.17 million per hectare for the larger (9.4  hectare plot).  After multiplying \nthe unit cost by the land plot area s and converting the result to UAH at the prevailing exchange \nrate as of the valuation date, Veritas concluded land values of UAH 12.2 million and UAH \n39.0 million for the smaller and larger land plots, respectively.   \n142. The total land value of UAH 51.1 million is then used to determine the value of the land use \nrights by incorporating assumptions regarding the capitalization rate, land rent rate, discount rate, and useful life of the Training Center .  Veritas calculated the value of the usage rights for  \nthe two land plots underlying the Training Center to be UAH 26.1 million.\n121   \n143. After adding the value of the underlying land rights to the depreciated replacement cost of \nthe real estate objects that comprise  the Training Center, Veritas reached a value co nclusion of \nUAH 332 million for the Training Center using the Cost Approach, as shown in Table 15 \nbelow.122   \nTable 15 – Summary of Value Conclusion – Veritas Training Center Report123 \n \n144.

Airfield  \n146. Two valuation reports were issued prior to 31 December 2016 for the Airfield .  First, UCE \nissued a report dated  25 June 2015 (“UCE Airfield Report”) using a valuation date of 18 June \n2015.\n124  Second, Kreston issued a report on 5 August 2016 (“Kreston Airfield Report”) that \nvalued the Airfield as of 1 July 2016.125  These two reports are discussed below in turn.  \niii. UCE  Airfield Report  \n147. UCE’s valuation was prepared approximately 12 months prior to the Airfield’s transfer to \nthe Bank in June 2016.  Despite the fact that the Airfield had not been used for aviation purposes in the years leading up to its transfer to the Bank, UCE indicated t hat the highest and \nbest use of the Airfield  was as an “agricultural aviation airfield .”\n126  When considering the \nvaluation techniques to be used to value the Airfield, UCE  dismissed the Income Approach \ndue to a lack of data  on the rental of similar complexes.127  Similarly, the Market Approach \nwas dismissed due to a lack of reliable sale data for comparable properties .128   \n \n124 IK0007549_0001_English , p. 4.  \n125 PB0163550_00001 _English , p. 3. \n126 IK0007549_0001_English , pp. 24 -25. \n127 IK0007549_0001_English , p. 23.  \n128 IK0007549_0001_English , p. 24.  \nD24/1/50\nPage 50 \n 148. Thus , UCE valued the Airfield using only the Cost Approach.129  UCE determined that the \nreplacement cost of the Airfield buildings was UAH 25.0 million .130  While the UCE Airfield \nReport suggests that UCE used the same formula to determine the replacement cost of the \nbuildings as the one used when valuing the Dnipro Stadium and Training Center under  the \nCost Approach, none of  the analysis underlying the UAH 25.0 million figure is contained in \nthe UCE Airfield Report.  \n149.  UCE does show the analysis supporting its calculation of the value of the rights  to use the \n139 hectares of leased land underlying the Airfield.  UCE selected four land plots  that it \nconsidered to be comparable  to the Airfield .  UCE made four adjustments to the values  of the \nselected comparables : 1) for the area of the comparable properties, 2) their intende d use, 3)  for \n“additional terms”, and 4) for bargaining .131  After making these adjustments, UCE calculated \na median land price of UAH  374/m2.132  UCE then applied this unit price to the area of the \nAirfield land plot  and then made a 35 percent downward adjustment to account for the fact that \nthe underlying land was leased rather than owned.  UCE concluded that the value of the rights \nto use the underlying land plot was UAH 341.1 million.  Finally, UCE added the  value of l and \nuse rights to the depreciated replacement cost of the real estate objects construc ted on that land \nand reached a value conclusion for the Airfield of UAH 366.1 million.133  \n150.

In my view, there are at least \nfour likely reasons why the NBU chose not to rely on the UCE valuation.   \n151. First, the UCE Training Center report was prepared well before the date of asset transfer and \nthe NBU likely preferred a more current valuation.   \n152. Second, significant portions of  UCE’s analysis and assumptions appear to be missing from \nthe UCE Airfield Report.

Third, UCE does not sufficiently explain on what basis it considers the properties selected \nfor use in its valuation of the underlying land plot s to be sufficiently comparable to the Airfield .  \nI note that Airfield  is more than 1,000 times larger than three of the four comparable properties  \nin terms of area .134  \n154. Fourth, UCE offers no explanation for  the 35 percent downward adjustment for the leasehold \nnature of the Airfield’s land use rights . \n155. For these reasons, I do not find it surprising that the NBU chose to approve the Kreston \nAirfield Report which I discuss next.  \niv. Kreston  Airfield Report  \n156.   The Kreston Airfield Report was prepared in August 2016 and valued the Airfield as of 1 \nJuly 2016, the month following the transfer of the Airfie ld to the Bank.135  Kreston indicated \nthat, due to the fact that the Airfield was in need of repairs  and is not used for its intended \npurpose, the Income Approach should not be applied.  In addition, due to the Airfield’s status \nas a special purpose real estate asset , Kreston opined that the Market Approach also could not \nbe used .136  Therefore, l ike UCE, Kreston used the Cost Approach and valued the buildings \nand structures separately from the land use rights.   \n157. In order to value the buildings and structures under the Cost Approach, Kreston  adopted a \nunit-based cost estimation methodology:  \n“To calculate the value of reproducing the subject buildings and \nproperty, the Valuer assessed value according to a per unit value for \na comparable building where per unit expense (1 m2 area or 1 m3 of bui lding volume) for the comparable is multiplied by the number \nof units in the subject property .”\n137 \n \n134 IK0007549_0001_English , p. 27.  \n135 PB0163550_00001 _English , p. 3.  \n136 PB0163550_00001 _English , p. 16.  \n137 PB0163550_00001 _English , p. 30.  \nD24/1/52\nPage 52 \n 158. When calculating the replacement cost of the buildings and structures, Kreston used a \nformula similar to th at used by UCE when valuing the Dnipro Stadium and Training Center, \nshown in Figure 3 below.  \nFigure 3 – Replacement Cost Formula  – Kreston Airfield Report138 \n \n159.

Next, Kreston considered the adjustment necessary to account for depreciat ion.  Kreston \nidentified the same three sources of depreciation discussed earlier, namely physical \ndepreciation, functional depreciation, and economic depreciation.140  For the headquarters \nbuilding, which had been recently renovated, Kreston performed a detailed analysis of the building’s components and calculated a weighted average depreciation adjustment of 19 \npercent, referencing the depreciation tables published by M arshall and Swift.\n141  All other \nbuildings and structures were assigned a depreciation adjustment based on that element’s \nstandard useful life and remaining useful life.  For the lavatory building, the resulting depreciation adjustment was 29 percent.  For all other elements, the depreciation adjustment \nwas 80 percent.\n142 \n161. Kreston then calculated the depreciated replacement cost of each of the 41 buildings or \nstructures located on the Airfield by multiplying the reference  unit price by the volume or area \n \n138 PB0163550_00001 _English , p. 30.  \n139 PB0163550_00001 _English , p. 30.  \n140 PB0163550_00001 _English , pp. 30 -31. \n141 PB0163550_00001 _English , p. 31.  \n142 PB0163550_00001 _English , p. 32.

Kreston calculated the total depreciated replacement cost of the 41 buildings and structures \nto be UAH 7.7 million.144 \n163.  Next, Kreston calculated the value of the usage rights attached to the land plots underlying \nthe Airfield.   Kreston indicated that the land plots underlying the Airfield were subject to a 49-\nyear lease agreement , and that as of the valuation date, the remaining term of that lease \nagreement was approximately 40 years.145  Kreston’s assessment of the lan d use rights is based \non the income that could be derived from the rental of the land over the remaining period of \nthe lease agreement , discounted to the valuation date .  Kreston used data on properties available \nfor sale and for rent in the Dnipro region to determine a capitalization rate for properties \nKreston deemed similar to the Airfield.    \n164. Kreston then adjusted this capitalization rate  and remov ed the portion related to land \nimprovements to calculate a capitalization rate for bare land  of 11 percent.146  Kreston then \nincorporated an “ adjustment  of standard monetary  valuation” and then used this capitalization \nrate to discount the projected income  derived from the rental of the land plots  over the \nremaining 40 years for which the land plots were leased.   \n165. Kreston reached a value conclusion for the rights to the underlying land of UAH 26.3 million  \nas shown in Table 17 below.   \n \n143 PB0163550_00001_English , p. 32.  \n144 PB0163550_00001_English , p. 34.  \n145 PB0163550_00001_English , p. 40.  \n146 PB0163550_00001_English , p. 40.

Finally, Kreston added the depreciated replacement cost of buildings and structures to the \nvalue of land use rights and determined a value conclusion under the C ost Approach of UAH \n34.0 million.147   \n167. The Kreston  valuation of the Airfield  appe ars to me to be a generally reasonable  \nimplementation of the Cost Approach.  Kreston’s estimation of the depreciated replacement  \nvalue of the buildings and structures located on the Airfield is methodologically sound and its \nassumptions and sources are lar gely transparent.   Kreston’s value conclusion for the buildings \nand structures differs from that of Mr. Thomas, who limited his valuation to the buildings and structures alone, by only UAH 2 million .\n148  Therefore, Mr. Thomas’s analysis in fact offers \nevidence as to the reaso nableness of Kreston’s calculation.   \n168. Kreston’s estimation of the value of the usage rights to the land plots underlying the Airfield \nis less clearly documented . Specifically, it is not clear how Kreston has estimated the annual \nrent amounts for the two la nd plots shown in Table  17 above.  The implied annual rental rate \nof approximately UAH 1/m2 is far less than the rental rates for the comparable real estate \ncontained in the Kreston Report, which are approximately US$ 1/m2/month, or approximately \nUAH 300/m2/year.149  In addition, several inputs to the capitalization rate calculation , \nincluding the transformation of the 12.84 percent capitalization rate for warehouse properties \nto an 11 percent capitalization rate for land , do not appear to be  fully explained.  However, \nconsidering that EY estimated the value of the land alone to range between UAH 40 million  \nand UAH 180 million, I consider Kreston’s valuation of the land use rights associated with the \nAirfield to be reasonable, if not overly conservative.150  \n \n147 PB0163550_00001 _English , p. 40.  \n148 Thomas Report, ¶ 5.52. Mr. Thomas does not consider  the value of the underlying land use rights, and reaches a \nvalue conclusion of UAH 5.7 million using the Market and Income Approaches.  \n149 PB0163550_00001 _English , pp. 38, 40.  \n150 EY Report, pp. 268-269. \nD24/1/55\nPage 55 \n 169. While I, or any other valuer, might have made different assumptions than those included in \nthe Kreston  Airfield Report, nothing in my review suggests that the parameters used by Kreston  \nrender its value conclusions  unreasonable.  Overall, I find it unsurprising that, given the choice \nbetween the UCE Airfield Report prepared a year ahead of the asset transf er, and the Kreston \nAirfield Report prepared the month following the transfer, the NBU preferred the analysis of \nKreston  in approving a value of UAH 34 million for the Airfield .   \n Additional Commentary on the 2016 Restated Fair Values  \n170.

In the following three subsections , I discuss the third -party valuation reports that \nunderpinned the 31 December 2016 r estated Fair Values for each of the three assets shown in \nTable 18 above. \nA. Dnipro Stadium  \n172. The 31 December 2016 r estated Fair Value of the Dnipro Stadium is taken from a report \nprepared by Sineks LLC in January 2019 (“Sineks Stadium Report”)  using a valuation date of \n31 December 2016.  Using only the Income Approach, Sineks valued the Dnipro Stadium at \njust UAH 16.2 million, a 99 percent reduction from the originally recognized Fair Value of UAH 1,517 million and the NBU approved Fair Value of UAH 1,544 million.\n151   \n173. I have five  observations regarding the Sineks Stadium Report. \n \n151 PB0271021_00001, p. 5.

First, while Sineks indicates that it has conducted its analysis under the Market Value \nstandard, it also indicates that the results of its analysis are to be used for IFRS accounting \npurposes.152  Under IF RS, the appropriate standard of value is Fair Value.  \n175. Second, the valuation prepared by Sineks is simply not reasonable  on its face.  I n the PTBK \nJS, the  experts reached an agreement on this point:  \n“Mr Thomas and Mr Kaczmarek agree the Sineks valuation is n ot a \nreasonable or credible valuation but for different reasons. Mr \nThomas agrees with the methodology used but disagrees with significant data inputs used in the valuation which result in inaccurate valuation conclusions. ”\n153  \n176. Both experts agree that a val uation of UAH 16.2 million, or approximately US$ 600,000 is \nnot reasonable or credible .  There does not appear to be any reasonable explanation as to why \na stadium that cost EUR 65 million to build would now, just eight years after its opening, be \nvalued a t less than one percent of that construction cost.  Nevertheless, the Bank adopt ed the \nSineks’s Fair V alue conclusion and r estated its 2016 financial statements  with that value  rather \nthan relying upon the Veritas Stadium Report approved by the NBU  in 2016.   \n177. Third, t he experts’ agreement that the Sineks’ valuation analysis is neither r easonable  nor \ncredible casts serious doubt upon the reliability of EY’s unqualified audit opin ion on the 2016 \nRestated Financial Statements which adopted the Sineks valuation analysis as an acceptable \nFair Value conclusion.  I am inclined to believe that EY likely accepted Sineks ' valuation \nanalysis in the restated 31 December 2016 financial statem ents because that analysis was \nconducted at the 2016 balance sheet date for the Bank (i.e., 31 December 2016) .  Previously, \nthe Bank had relied upon the UCE Stadium Report for its 2016 financial statements, but as \ndiscussed earlier, that valuation report w as outdated. The Veritas Stadium Report could have \n(and should have) been used to support the Bank’s Fair Value calculation for the Dnipro Stadium  in its 2016 financial statements , but it appears that the Bank never sought to use  the \nFair Value conclusion presented in the Veritas Stadium Report and never presented the Veritas \nStadium Report to EY to audit that value.\n 154      \n \n152 PB0271021_00001, p. 3. \n153 PTBK JS, Section 7.4.  \n154 This is evident from the Bank’s 2017 financial statements which made no change to the 201"}

Nevertheless, the shared view of the experts in this matter indicates  that EY accepted an \nunreasonable and incredible analysis to issue an unqualified opinion on the Dnipro Stadium \nFair Value .  While a Level 3 Fair Value analysis affords a wide  range of potential valuation \noutcomes due to differences in professional views , the experts in this case agree the Sineks \nvaluation result falls outside of this range. \n179. Fourth, the Sineks Stadium report relied upon data that was not know n or knowable as of the \n31 December 2016 valuation date, rendering it non- compliant with IFRS 13 .  For example, the \nsource given for the ticket prices for both football matches and non- football events at the \nDnipro Stadium is from 2018.155  Similarly , Sineks determin ed the additional income derived \nfrom the rental of office and warehouse space by reference to comparable property data taken \nfrom 2018.156  These factors add further doubt about EY’s review of the Sineks valuation \nanalysis when issuing an unqualified opinion on the 31 December 2016 restated Fair Value for the Dnipro Stadium.   \n180. Fifth , Mr. Thomas has already identified clear errors in the inputs used by Sineks when \nvaluing the Dnipro Stadium under  the Income Approach.  For example, Sineks significantly \nunderstates the  historical attendance at the Stadium, provides no basis for its ticke t price \nestimate, does not  account for certain operating costs, and does not  consider advertising \nrevenue in its calculation of the Stadium’s projected income .\n157  As a result, Sineks values the \nDnipro stadium at approximately 1 percent of its construction c ost, a value the experts agree  \nis not credible .  \n181. Thus, for the reasons discussed above, I consider  the Sineks Stadium Report , the 31 \nDecember 2016 restated Fair Value of the Dnipro Stadium , and EY’s unqualified audit opinion \nof the Bank’s 2016 restated financial statements to be flawed . \nB. Training Center  \n182. The 31 December 2016 restated Fair Value of the Training Center is taken from a report also \nprepared by Sineks LLC in January 2019 (“Sineks Training Center Report”)  using a valuation \ndate of 31 December 2016.  Using only the Income Approach, Sineks valued the Training \n \n155 Thomas I, Appendix 4, ¶ 4.2.21.  \n156 Thomas I, Appendix 4, ¶ 4.2.21.  \n157 Thomas I, Appendix 4, ¶ 4.2.21.  \nD24/1/58\nPage 58 \n Center at UAH 142.0 million, a 79 percent reduction from the originally recognized Fair Value \nof UAH 670.5 million performed by UCE and a 57 percent reduction from the NBU approved \nFair Value of UAH 332.0 million performed by Veritas .158  The value conclusion in the Sineks \nTraining Center R eport was , however, 35 percent higher than that  of Mr. Thomas , who valued \nthe Training Center at UAH 104.9 million.  \n183. I have three  comments on the Sineks Training Center Report.  \n184. First, as with the Sineks Stadium Report, Sineks indicate d that the results of its analysis of \nthe Training Center are to be used for IFRS  accounting purposes.  Under IFRS, the appropriate \nstandard of value is Fair Value.  \n185. Second, I am inclined to believe that EY accepted the Sineks valuation analysis in the restated \n31 December 2016 financial statements because that analysis was conducted at the 2016 balance sheet date for the Bank (i.e., 31 December 2016) .

I am inclined to believe that EY \nlikely accepted the Sineks valuation analysis in the restated 31 December 2016 financial statements because that analysis was conducted at the 2016 balance sheet date for the Bank (i.e., 31 December 2016).  Previously, the Bank had relied upon the UCE Training Center  \nReport for its 2016 financial statements, but as discussed earlier, that valuation report was \noutdated. The Veritas Training Center  Report could have (and should have) been used to \nsupport the Bank’s Fair Value calculation for the Dnipro Training Center  in its 2016 financial \nstatements, but it appears that the Bank never sought to use the Fair Value conclusion presented \nthe Veritas Training Center  Report and never presented the Veritas Training Center  Repor t to \nEY to audit that value.\n159     \n186. Third , the Sineks Training Center Report relied on price data  taken from 2017 and 2018, \nafter the indicated valuation date of 31 December 2016.160  Again, this renders Sineks’ \nvaluation non- compliant with IFRS 13 . These factors add further doubt about EY’s review of \nthe Sineks valuation analysis when issuing an unqualified opinion on the 31 December 2016 restated Fair Value for the Training Center.  \n \n158 PB0271022_00001.  \n159 This is evident from the Bank’s 2017 financial statements which made no change to the 2016 Fair Value \ncalculations for the Transferred Assets.  \n160 PB0271022_00001, pp. 52 -53. \nD24/1/59\nPage 59 \n 187. Thus, for the reasons discussed above, I consider the Sineks Training Center Report, the 31 \nDecember 2016 restated Fair Value of the Training Center, and EY’s audit of the Bank’s 2016 \nrestated financial statements to be flawed.   \nC. Airfield  \n188. The 31 December 2016 restated Fair Value of the Airfield is taken from a report prepared by \nAsset Expertise  (\"AE\") in February 2019 (“AE Airfield Report”).  AE  valued the Airfield as \nof 31 December 2016 at UAH 3.6 million using the Market  Approach, a 99 percent reduction \nfrom the originally recognized Fair Value of UAH 366.1 million prepared by UCE and a n 89 \npercent reduction from the NBU approved Fair Value of 34.0 million prepared by Kreston.161 \n189. I have three  observations regarding the AE Airfield Report . \n190. First, the AE Airfield Report indicates that its purpose is for use in “determining the Fair \nValue  of Property for accounting purposes under IFRS.”162  This suggests to me  that AE \nconsidered its valuation to be compliant with IFRS 13. \n191. Second, like Mr. Thomas, AE valued only the area of the premises located  at the Airfield \nand did not value the rights to use the underlying land plots for the re maining 40 years for \nwhich those land plots were leased.163  As discussed in Section  VII.C above , the land use rights \naccounted for approximately 80 percent of the total Fair Value of the Airfield that was \napproved by the NBU. Thus , the principal driver of the difference between the 31 December \n2016 restated Fair Value of the Airfield  of UAH 3. 6 million  prepared by AE  and the NBU \napproved Fair Value of UAH 34.0 million prepared by Kreston, is almost entirely attributed to \nthe value of the land use rights (i.e. , the difference in the respective valuations of those \nbuildings and structures is less than US$ 200,000) .  It is a question of fact as to whether land \nuse rights were transferred to the Bank along with the buildings and structures.  \n192.

For example, AE uses \n \n161 PB0365513_00001, p. 32.

Neither Mr. Thomas nor I have agreed to modify our valuation opinions in the present  case \nfollowing our expert meeting and joint report submi ssion.  There are general areas of \ndisagreement which affect  all or more than one  Transferred Real Estate Asset.   I addressed \nthese general areas in Sections III to VI in this First Supplemental Repo rt.  In the following \nsubsections, I will provide further commentary on the flaws in Mr. Thomas’ valuation of each \nTransferred Asset.   \nA. Dnipro Stadium  \n194. Mr. Thomas does not appear to recognize or appreciate that the FC  Dnipro team , the Dnipro \nStadium , and the  Training Center operated as integrated assets as is often the case for other \nEuropean football clubs .  As such, the physical facilities may not have been operated under \ntheir highest and best use as independent assets.  Moreover , by transferring the Dnipro Stadium \nto the Bank and separating it from the FC Dnipro team , a number of new factors would have \nto be examined in order to achieve the highest and best use of the Dnipro Stadium. I consider \nfour possibilities below  that would have to  be examined in relation to  the operating structure.  \n195. First, the FC Dnipro team would need to lease the Dnipro Stadium or enter into a revenue \nsharing arrangement with the stadium owner concerning, for example, broadcasting rights, \nadvertising, and sponsors hip revenue  which are ordinarily sources of income for the football \nclub.  \n196. Second, the Bank  (or any third -party owner) w ould look to maximize revenues in several \nnew a nd different ways.  The owner c ould, for instance,  look to sell naming rights to the \nstadi um and maximize advertising revenues throughout the venue.  The owner would also look \nat the possibility of pitching Dnipro Stadium as a host site for clubs that could no longer play \nin the Donbass region or even as a regional hub stadium and neutral site for teams east of the \nDnieper  River to allow multiple clubs to share operating costs and overheads.    \n \n164 PB0365513_00001, pp. 17, 25. AE valued the Airfield at UAH 4.0 million using the Income Approach, but based \nits final valuation conclusion entirely on its Market Approach. PB0365513_00001, p. 32.  \nD24/1/61\nPage 61 \n 197. Third, the stadium owner would seek to maximize the non- football revenues of the Dnipro \nStadium that the previous owner may not have been inclined to purs ue.  These activities could \nbe music concerts, holiday festivals, and other sporting events  such as professional tennis \ntournaments , etc.  \n198. Fourth, the Stadium owner might seek to convert the Dnipro Stadium to an alternative real \nestate project to maximize its highest and best use.  For example, one might consider \nconverting the stadium to residential apartments, corporate offices, hotel rooms or a \ncombination of the above.  In addition, the ground level spac"}
{"start": 140000, "text": "ve been inclined to purs ue.  These activities could \nbe music concerts, holiday festivals, and other sporting events  such as professional tennis \ntournaments , etc.  \n198. Fourth, the Stadium owner might seek to convert the Dnipro Stadium to an alternative real \nestate project to maximize its highest and best use.  For example, one might consider \nconverting the stadium to residential apartments, corporate offices, hotel rooms or a \ncombination of the above.  In addition, the ground level space might be convert ed to restaurant \nand retail space to serve as a large modern shopping and retail center.165  Yet another possibility \nis a conversion to a hospital and medical facility.166 \n199. The overall flaw in Mr. Thomas’ valuation of the Dnipro Stadium using the Income \nApproach is that he does not adequately consider all of the new possible uses for the Dnipro \nStadium as either a facility owned by the Bank or as an alternative real estate project.  Instead, \nMr. Thomas attempts to value the Dnipr o Stadium as it previously operated as an integrated \nfacility with FC Dnipro.  \n200. I recognize that performing the above analysis requires a lot of information, data, and \nfinancial modeling to assess the income potential for the Dnipro Stadium that is difficult to gather.  Nonetheless, the h ighest and best use principle upon which we agree necessitates this \nanalysis.\n167  Moreover, IFRS 13 specifically recognizes that the choice of  valuation techniques \nto be employed require s not only professional judgment, but also sufficient data to implement  \nthe technique. \n“An entity shall use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the \ncircumstances and for which sufficient data are available  to \nmeasure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.”\n168 [emphasis \nadded]  \n \n165 MacIntyre, Stephen, “Repurposing Sports Arenas and Stadiums in a New World,” 20 October 2020. (BK-56); \nPatowary, Kaushik, “Highbury Square: a 93 -Year -Old Football Stadium Converted into Apartments,” 25 February \n2016.  (BK-57) \n166 Newcomb, Tim, “From Stadium to…What?

(BK-10) \nD24/1/62\nPage 62 \n 201. Given the lack of available data to assess the new potential uses of the Dnipro Stadium, the \nCost Approach should ha ve been preferred by Mr. Thomas.  Finally, while Mr. Thomas and I \nagree the Sineks valuation of UAH 16.2 million (US$ 650,000) is neither reasonable nor \ncredible, I consider Mr. Thomas’ valu e conclusion of UAH 125.4 million (U S$ 5 million) \nremains  relative ly close to the Sineks valuation conclusion, with both assessments far below \nthe Fair Value approved by the NBU . \nB. Training Center  \n202. Mr. Thomas describes the Training Center  in his First Expert Report dated 24 November \n2021 as follows:  \n“The Dnipro Training Center is an income -generating complex of \nassets that supports a package of sports, training and recreational \nactivities, and related services, within the sports tourism sector, with \na focus on football activities.

Opening the Training Center to the public , rather than marketing it to \ntourists,  would likely  result in the highest and best use of the Training Center.  \n204. Mr. Thomas states that he has not been provided with any historical financial data for the \nTraining Center , and I have not been provided with a ny either.170 This is likely the result of the \nTraining Center being exclusively utilized by FC Dnipro as an integrated asset of the club  \nwhere separate reporting of profit centers was not useful.  Nevertheless, Mr. Thomas and I \nappear have a common underst anding as to the characterization of the Training Center with \n \n169 Thomas I, ¶ 3.12.  \n170 Thomas I, ¶ 3.31.  \nD24/1/63\nPage 63 \n yet another important distinction.  Mr. Thomas opines that  the Training Center would belong \nto a sector of the hospitality industry referred to as Sports Tourism.  \n“The Dnipro Training Center ope rates, as do the 27 comparable \nproperties shown in Table 3.3, in a sector of the hospitality industry \nknown as ‘Sports Tourism’42, as defined below.  \nSports tourism is a type of tourism activity which refers to the travel experience of the tourist who either observes as a spectator or \nactively participates in a sporting event generally involving \ncommercial and non- commercial activities of a competitive nature.  \nSports tourism is a niche market within the hospitality industry and \none of its fastest -growing sec tors, particularly in recent decades, as \nincreasing numbers of tourists make sports activities an integral part \nof their holidays, whether sports are the main objective of travel or \nnot.”\n171 \n205. I disagree with Mr. Thomas’ assessment that the Training Center wo uld best operate in the \nSports Tourism industry.  My view is that the highest and best use of the Training Center would \nbe a membership -oriented sports club  where additional income could be achieved through \n“drop- in fees” or “one time use fees” as well as leasing  fees for the pool, indoor football field, \nand outdoor football fields.  In other words, I believe  far more income could be generated for \nthe Training Center if it was marketed to residents of the Dnipro metropolitan area  on a \nmembership basis , while also leasing  other assets to both members and non- members  on an as \nneeded or reserved basis.  While the Training Center might attract some use from tourists, I do \nnot consider tourists to Dnipro to be the primary target market for the Training Center.   In this \nsense, the Training Center would operate more akin to a private sporting club where the club would supplement its monthly membership fees  from non -members for the use of its facilities \nand members for the use of fees on a reservation basis.  \n206. Mr. Thom as appears to assign the Training Center to the Sports Tour ism industry because \nthe facility  contains 17 cottages and a dormitory with 115 beds.  The cottages could be rented \nper night by both members and non- members  much like a hotel.  The dormitories might also \nbe rented depending upon their configuration or modified to enable rental much like a hotel as well.  However, the mere fact that the Training Center has these “ hotel -like” assets does not \n \n171 Thomas I, ¶¶ 3.20-3.21.  \nD24/1/64\nPage 64 \n require  that the entire Training Center be relegated to the Sports Tourism industry.

The key \ndifference in our respective views is that I consider the primary source of income would be \ngenerated from membership fees while Mr. Thomas only considers income from to urists on a \nper use basis.  A membership model would be  far more attractive as it would generate a steady \nflow of membership fees on a monthly basis.   Membership models also typical ly charge an \ninitiation fee  upon joining.  Mr. Thomas’ Income Approach does  not consider these core fees  \nfor a membership model.  As such, I am of the view that Mr. Thomas’ Income Approach doe s \nnot meet the highest and best use requirement.  \n207. Unfortunately, no studies were performed in 2016 nor at any other time (at least they have  \nnot been made available to me or Mr. Thomas) to  adequately develop a potential cash flow \nmodel and i mplement the Income Approach for purposes of valuing the  Training Center.   As \nsuch, the Cost Approach is the most appropriate valuation technique to apply for the Training \nCenter  in my view.  The Cost Approach was implemented by Veritas and the NBU approved \nthe value conclusion reached by Veritas under the Cost Approach.    \nC. Airfield  \n208. With respect to the Airfield, Mr. Thomas takes the view that the Kreston Rep ort, which \nvalued the Airfield at UAH 34 million , was approved by the NBU, and is the basis for my own  \nFair Value  assessment , does not comply with either  IVS 2013 or IFRS 13.172  Mr. Thomas \nstates that he will explain his position in his supplemental report.  I have already explained \nprevious ly in this report, as well as in the PTBK JS at paragraph 7.28, that  Kreston valued the \nbuildings and structures at UAH 7.7 million and the land use rights at UAH 26.3 million, while \nMr. Thomas valued the buildings and structures at UAH 5.7 million and the land use rights at \nUAH 0.173  There is therefore only a UAH 2 million (US$ 80,000) difference between the \nvaluation of the buildings and str uctures between Kreston and Mr. Thomas.  I consider that \nMr. Thomas’ valuation only serves to support the valuation conclusion of Kreston for the \nbuildings and structures given the small differenc e. \n209. The primary difference between Kreston’s valuation of the  Airfield and that of Mr. Thomas \nlies with the land use rights.  Under the Cost Approach, the land upon which buildings and \n \n172 PTBK JS, ¶ 7.33.  \n173 Kaczmarek I, ¶ 281. \nD24/1/65\nPage 65 \n structures reside is valued first as if vacant (typically under the Market Approach) and then the \ncost of constructing the buildings  and structures, adjusted for depreciation and obsolescence, \nis then added to the value of the vacant land.  The fact that the underlying land is subject to a \nlong- term lease, rather than being owned outright, does not, in my view, mean that the rights \nto use the land do not hold value.  \n210. Nevertheless, as previously mentioned, whether or not the land use rights underneath the \nexisting buildings and structures were  transferred to the Bank is a factual matter that must be \nresolved with further evidence  or explanation.        \n Expert Declaration  \n211.
