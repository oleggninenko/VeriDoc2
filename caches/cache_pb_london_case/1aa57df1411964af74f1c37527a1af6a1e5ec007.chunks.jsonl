This initial section contains brief introductory remarks.  In subsection A, I provide a brief \nintroduction of myself and my qualifications to the Court.  In subsection B, I provide my \nunderstanding of the present dispute between the parties as it pertains to the Transferred Assets.  \nIn subsection C, I summarize the instructions I have received from Counsel in preparing this \nreport.  In subsection D, I identify particular issues related to my review of the documents in \nthe record in this case.  Finally, in subsection E I outline the organization for the remainder of \nmy report.   \nA. Introduction and My Qualifications \n2. I, Brent C. Kaczmarek CFA, am a Partner in the Arlington, VA office of IAV Advisors LLC \n(“IAV”).  I am the 100 percent owner of IAV which I formed in August 2018.  Previous to my \nfounding of IAV, I worked for Navigant Consulting Inc. (“Navigant”), a global, listed, \nconsultancy firm.  Navigant no longer exists.  Navigant sold its Disputes, Forensics, and Legal \nTechnology Segment and Transaction Advisory Services Practice to Ankura Consulting LLC \n(“Ankura”).  Navigant sold its remaining professional services practices nearly a year later to \nprivate-equity firm Veritas Capital.  I was formerly with the Disputes practice at Navigant for \n17 years, from 2001 until the sale of that practice to Ankura in August 2018, and I led \nNavigant’s International Arbitration practice.  I decided in August 2018 to form my own \nboutique firm rather than join Ankura.  Previous to joining Navigant, I worked at Arthur \nAndersen LLP and LECG Inc. between 1993 and 2001.    \n3. I hold the designation of Chartered Financial Analyst, a globally recognized designation held \nby professionals demonstrating competence in the investment valuation and decision-making \nprocess. I received this designation in 1998 from the Association for Investment Management \nand Research (now CFA Institute), the governing body of charter-holders. There are charter-\nholders and charter-holder candidates residing in more than 150 countries worldwide. \n4. I have been appointed as an economic, financial, asset valuation, and damages expert in more \n160 disputes, including more than 150 international arbitrations.  Most of the international \narbitrations in which I am appointed are disputes between investors and sovereign states under \nvarious bi-lateral or muti-lateral investment treaties. The commercial arbitrations in which I \nhave been appointed have typically related to shareholder agreement disputes, production \nD20/1/6\n \nPage 6 \n sharing agreements and other matters that have also involved valuation issues.  I have also \nbeen appointed as an expert in litigation matters in the USA, UK, Sweden, and the Turks & \nCaicos. \n5. My valuation work and expertise includes all forms of assets including, inter alia , overall \nbusiness enterprises, common shares of business, corporate debt, sovereign debt, derivatives \n(such as put and call options), real estate, and real property.

I have also \nbeen appointed as an expert in litigation matters in the USA, UK, Sweden, and the Turks & \nCaicos. \n5. My valuation work and expertise includes all forms of assets including, inter alia , overall \nbusiness enterprises, common shares of business, corporate debt, sovereign debt, derivatives \n(such as put and call options), real estate, and real property.  I have performed valuation \nanalysis of such assets in the USA, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, \nDominican Republic, Jamaica, Turks & Caicos, Chile, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, Venezuela, \nArgentina, and Uruguay, Spain, Germany, Sweden, Cyprus, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, \nCzech Republic, Slovak Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Croatia, Albania, Montenegro, \nUkraine, Turkey, UAE, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Yemen, Algeria, Angola, Egypt, South \nAfrica, Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Georgia, Pakistan, India, \nThailand, Vietnam, South Korea, Philippines, and New Zealand. \n6. With respect to matters in Ukraine specifically, I have previously been appointed as an expert \nto value natural gas fields, hotels, office buildings, apartment buildings, airports, petrol \nstations, oil storage facilities, and residential property.  The hotels, office buildings, apartment \nbuildings, airports, petrol stations, and oil storage facilities were all located in Crimea as were \nthe subject assets in three international arbitrations against the Russian Federation.  These \nassets were all expropriated in 2014 following the Russian Federation’s annexation of the \npeninsula. The First Defendant was an indirect beneficiary in these three international \narbitrations and a direct client in one matter.  My other expert work in Ukraine involves \nappointments by Naftogaz, Ukraine’s state-owned oil and gas company, in several \ninternational disputes involving natural gas trading matters.  Those matters included disputes \nbetween Ukraine and the Russian Federation or gas prices and gas transit fees that resulted in \ngas supplies being cut off to Eastern Europe. \n7. I also have served as an expert in many international arbitrations or litigations involving bank \nfailures and restructurings.  Specifically, I have served as a financial expert on such cases in \nthe Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Sweden, Peru, Argentina, and South \nKorea.     \n8. My curriculum vitae is provided as Appendix A to this report.   \nD20/1/7\n \nPage 7 \n B. My Understanding of the Present Dispute Concerning the Transferred Assets \n9. The following represents my overall understanding of the present dispute pertaining to the \nTransferred Assets.  This summary should not be construed to represent the full or particular \nposition of either Claimant or Defendants. \n10. Between 2013 and 2015, PricewaterhouseCoopers Ukraine (“PWC”) was the auditor of JSC \nCommercial Bank PrivatBank (“PrivatBank” or “Claimant” or “Bank”).  In January 2016, the \nNational Bank of Ukraine (“NBU”) conducted a stress test of PrivatBank which concluded that \nthe bank needed to raise its regulatory capital by UAH 113 billion.   \n11. In February 2016, the Management and Supervisory Board of PrivatBank approved a Financial \nRecovery Plan that included a Restructuring Program.  Under the Restructuring Program, \nPrivatBank was to take possession of 169 properties/assets with an alleged value of UAH 31 \nbillion and be granted mortgages over other properties/assets with an alleged value of UAH 77 \nbillion.  The NBU approved the Restructuring Program and undertook to confirm the Fair \nValue of the assets transferred to the Bank. \n12.  The assets transferred to PrivatBank (the “Transferred Assets”) included: 246 petrol stations, \n72 oil storage facilities, 9 aircraft and 7 real estate properties. \n13. Confirmation of the Fair Value of the Transferred Assets appears to have been"}

The NBU approved the Restructuring Program and undertook to confirm the Fair \nValue of the assets transferred to the Bank. \n12.  The assets transferred to PrivatBank (the “Transferred Assets”) included: 246 petrol stations, \n72 oil storage facilities, 9 aircraft and 7 real estate properties. \n13. Confirmation of the Fair Value of the Transferred Assets appears to have been performed under \na tripartite agreement between independent valuers, PrivateBank, and the NBU. \n“The NBU validated the value of part of the repossessed property. \nValidation was performed through the receipt of reports of \nindependent valuers under tripartite agreements (between the valuer, \nthe Bank and the NBU). A total of 254 properties with a value at the \ntime the Bank took possession of them 31.9 billion UAH were \nvalidated. The value according to the results of the validation was \nUAH 31.5 billion.”1 \n14. Only a portion of the transferred assets appears to have been validated.  The results of the \nvalidation are shown in Figure 1 below.   \n \n1 PB0092834_00001_English (“EY Report”), p. 13. \nD20/1/8\n \nPage 8 \n Figure 1 – Summary of NBU Fair Value Validation2 \n \n  \n15. Although the NBU had validated many of the Fair Value calculations adopted by PrivatBank \nin 2016, the calculations would ultimately be revisited and restated retrospectively in 2018 and \nsignificantly lowered.  I will discuss the aspects of this restatement in Section VII.   Claimant \nhas retained financial experts in this dispute who have largely validated the retrospective \nrestatement.  I will address the overall manner in which Claimant’s experts have carried out \ntheir analysis in section VII. \nC. My Instructions \n16. Solicitors for the First Defendant, Fieldfisher LLP (“Fieldfisher”), has instructed me to address \nthe value of the Transferred Assets with the exception of the Aircraft Assets.  Mr. Philip \nSeymour of IBA Aero was instructed to address the value of the Aircraft Assets. \n17. More specifically, I have been instructed by Fieldfisher to assess whether the values of the \nTransferred Assets as reported by PrivatBank in its 2016 financial statements were in \naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), the accounting \nstandards under which PrivatBank prepared its financial statements.  IFRS 13 provides the \n \n2 EY Report, p. 40. \nD20/1/9\n \nPage 9 \n rules and guidelines under which Fair Value should be measured.  As such, I use IFRS 13 as \nmy guide to assess the Fair Values of the Transferred Assets in 2016.   \n18. While Mr. Bezant has been instructed to adopt a valuation date of 1 July 2016 (the average \ndate upon which the Fixed Assets were Transferred to the accounting ledgers of PrivatBank), \nI have adopted a valuation date of 31 December 2016.3  I don’t believe the difference in our \nchosen dates has any effect.  It appears that the Fair Values at initial recognition of all \nTransferred Assets remained the same at year end 2016 with the exception of the Dnipro Office \nand Hotel Zirka.  These two assets were adjusted downward in value very shortly after their \ninitial recognition.  The adjusted values for these two assets correspond to the pleaded values \nfor these assets by the First Defendant, as do all the other values for the Transferred Assets.        \n19. If PrivatBank did not report the Transferred Assets in accordance with IFRS 13, I will explain \nto the Court why that is so and to provide my own independent Fair Value calculation that \nwould conform to IFRS 13. \n20. PrivatBank also reported the Fair Value of the Transferred Assets in its financial statements \nfrom 2017 to 2018.  However, the Fair Value of the Transferred Assets were reduced \nsignificantly in 2017 and then further in 2018.  Moreover, in the 2018 financial statements, \nPrivatBank restated downward the Fair Values of the Transferred Assets as originally"}

PrivatBank also reported the Fair Value of the Transferred Assets in its financial statements \nfrom 2017 to 2018.  However, the Fair Value of the Transferred Assets were reduced \nsignificantly in 2017 and then further in 2018.  Moreover, in the 2018 financial statements, \nPrivatBank restated downward the Fair Values of the Transferred Assets as originally set forth \nin the 31 December 2016 financial statements based upon valuations the bank commissioned \nfrom outside valuation firms.4  I am instructed to consider historic valuation and will opine \nupon the work done to support the restated Fair Values the Bank recognized in the 31 \nDecember 2016 financial statements.  I also am instructed to opine, to the extent possible, as \nto whether the Fair Values Reported in 2017 and 2018 conform to IFRS 13. \n21. Finally, I am instructed to comment on the reports submitted by Mr. Bezant and Mr. Thomas \non Transferred Assets.  Mr. Bezant addresses the value of all Transferred Assets except the \nDnipro Stadium, Dnipro Training Centre, and the Airfield at Slobzhansky Settlement, Ukraine \nwhich are addressed by Mr. Thomas.  A complete letter of instruction is submitted as Appendix \nB.      \n \n3 Expert Report of Mark Bezant on Transferred Assets, 24 November 2021 (“Bezant Transferred Assets Report”), ¶ \n1.26. \n4 PrivatBank 2018 Financial Statements, p. 11. (MB-A119)  \nD20/1/10\n \nPage 10 \n 22. The First Defendant has also engaged Mr. Travis Taylor of Secretariat International \n(“Secretariat”) to also serve as a valuation expert in this matter.  Mr. Taylor was asked to \nprovide independent valuations related to the share pledges.  While I have conferred with \nSecretariat and IBA Aero during this assignment, I did not contribute to their valuation work.  \nLikewise, they did not contribute to my valuation work.  All opinions expressed herein are my \nown. \nD.  Documents Made Available to Me  \n23. Documents disclosed between the parties, which numbered in the thousands.  The documents \nmade available to me are listed in Appendix C.  Most of these documents were originally \nprepared in Ukrainian.  I do not read, speak, or write Ukrainian.  Accordingly, I have relied \nupon translations of these documents or translation services provided by Fieldfisher.  I have \nalso relied upon members of Secretariat’s team that are fluent in Ukrainian. \nE. Organization of the Remainder of this Report \n24. The remainder of this report contains eight additional sections.  In Section II, I provide an \nexecutive summary of my opinion concerning both the original Fair Values recognized in the \n31 December 2016 financial statements of PrivatBank (“Original 2016 Fair Values”) and the \nrestated Fair Values (“Restated 2016 Fair Values”).  I also provide my own opinion of Fair \nValue for the Transferred Assets.  In Section III, I provide the Court with an overview the \ninternationally recognized standards of value.  In Section IV, I identify the relevant standard \nof value for the Transferred Assets.  In Section V, I present my review the EY Report and the \nEY audits of PrivatBank in relation to the Transferred Assets. In Section VI, I discuss my view \nas to the reasons for the need to restate the Original 2016 Fair Value calculations.  In Section \nVII, I summarize my approach to the calculation of the Fair Value of the Transferred Real \nEstate Assets as of 1 December 2016.  In Section VIII, I provide my expert declaration.  \nFinally, in Section IX I provide my statement of truth. \n25. I intend to file my Second Report on 21 February 2022, which will address my Fair Value \nassessments of the petrol stations and oil storage facilities. \n Executive Summary \n26.

I intend to file my Second Report on 21 February 2022, which will address my Fair Value \nassessments of the petrol stations and oil storage facilities. \n Executive Summary \n26. The word “value” has a different meaning to different individuals. Thus, in any valuation \nexercise, it is important to first define the word “value” to establish a common understanding. \nD20/1/11\n \nPage 11 \n “Without carefully defining the term value, the conclusions reached \nin the valuation report have no meaning. Is the objective of the \nvaluation to estimate fair market value, market value, fair value, true \nvalue, investment value, intrinsic value, fundamental value, \ninsurance value, book value, use value, collateral value, ad valorem \nvalue, or some other value? Clients rarely give it much thought. \nMany don’t have enough technical background in business valuation \nto raise the right questions. One of the professional appraiser’s most \nimportant tasks is to work carefully and thoroughly with the client \nand/or attorney to arrive at a definition of value that is appropriate \nto the specific purpose of the valuation engagement.”5 \n27. In the nomenclature of business valuation, these different definitions of value are called \n“standards of value.”  It is important for the valuation practitioner to establish the appropriate \nstandard of value prior to conducting a valuation assignment so that the valuation conclusion \ncan be properly understood.   \n28. Mr. Bezant and Mr. Thomas have taken an instruction to apply the Market Value standard in \ntheir respective valuations of the Transferred Assets.  In my view, Fair Value, and not Market \nValue, is the proper standard of value in this case.  The Transferred Assets were recorded on \nthe Bank’s financial statements at their Fair Values, and it was the Fair Value of the Transferred \nAssets that was used to offset certain obligations under the Restructuring Program.   It was the \nFair Value of the Transferred Assets that was evaluated by the NBU and ultimately adjusted \nupon the Bank’s 2018 restatement of its 2016 financial statements. \n29. While Fair Value and Market Value are very similar standards of value, Fair Value is more \nprescriptive in its implementation than Market Value.  Specifically, the implementation rules \nfor Fair Value are agnostic regarding the valuation approach (i.e., income approach, market \napproach, or cost approach).  Instead, Fair Value guidelines prescribe a hierarchy in which the \nvaluer is required to make use of the approach that maximizes the use of observable inputs, \nand minimizes the use of unobservable inputs.  There are three levels to the hierarchy (Level \n1, 2, and 3).6  Fair value must be measured at the highest possible level available (Level 1 being \nthe highest and Level 3 the lowest). \n \n5 Pratt, Reilly & Schweihs, Valuing a Business: The Analysis and Appraisal of Closely Held Companies, Fourth \nEdition, McGraw-Hill, 2000, p. 28 (BK-09). \n6 EY, “Applying IFRS: IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement,” November 2012, p. 129. (BK-10) \nD20/1/12\n \nPage 12 \n 30. This distinction is especially important when determining the value of the Dnipro Stadium and \nthe Dnipro Training Center.  Mr. Thomas has dismissed the use of the cost approach in favor \nof the income approach, despite the fact that historical cost information was available, while \nhistorical revenue and cost information was not.  In the case of these assets, the cost approach \nis the methodology that makes most use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of \nunobservable inputs.  Therefore, I do not believe that Mr. Thomas’s valuation of these two \nassets conforms to IFRS 13. \n31.

Therefore, I do not believe that Mr. Thomas’s valuation of these two \nassets conforms to IFRS 13. \n31. As part of my assessment of the Fair Value of the seven real estate assets transferred to the \nBank, I reviewed the contemporaneous valuation analysis that was prepared for the Bank \nrelated to each property.  Each of the seven properties were valued by at least two independent \nvaluation firms that were retained by the Bank in 2016 to assist in the assessment of the assets’ \nFair Values.  Upon transfer to the Bank in 2016, an initial Fair Value was recognized.  For two \nassets, the Dnipro Office and Hotel Zirka, the initially recognized Fair Values were adjusted \ndownward shortly after the asset transfer, and the lower values were reported in the Bank’s \nfinancial statements for the year ending 31 December 2016.  For the remaining assets, the \ninitially recognized value remained unchanged in the Bank’s financial statements at year-end. \n32. Confirmation of the Fair Value of the majority of the Transferred Assets appears to have been \nperformed under a tripartite agreement between the independent valuers, the Bank, and the \nNBU. \n“The NBU validated the value of part of the repossessed property. \nValidation was performed through the receipt of reports of \nindependent valuers under tripartite agreements (between the valuer, \nthe Bank and the NBU). A total of 254 properties with a value at the \ntime the Bank took possession of them 31.9 billion UAH were \nvalidated. The value according to the results of the validation was \nUAH 31.5 billion.”7 \n33. Separately, EY was retained to review the Fair Value assessments recognized by the Bank and \nverified by the NBU.  In the Bank’s 2018 financial statements, the Fair Values recorded in the \n2016 financial statements were restated for six of the seven transferred real estate assets.   \n \n7 EY Report, p. 13. \nD20/1/13\n \nPage 13 \n 34. Having reviewed the Real Estate valuation reports prepared in 2015/16, observed the \nadjustments recommended by the NBU, and reviewed the EY Report, I found it unnecessary \nto perform any de novo valuations for these assets.  For five of the seven real estate assets (the \nKyiv Office, the Dnipro Office, the Dnipro Stadium, the Dnipro Training Center, and the \nAirfield), it is my opinion that the Fair Values determined by the original valuers and then \nvalidated by the NBU are consistent with IFRS 13.  While reasonable valuation professionals \nmay reach different value conclusions for these assets based on the adoption of different \nassumptions, it is entirely possible for both valuations to be compliant with IFRS 13.  This is \nespecially true given that all the Transferred Assets were assessed at Level 3, meaning that the \nrange of IFRS 13 compliant values is relatively wide.   \n35. For Hotel Zirka, I observed that there were certain errors, rather than simply differences in \nassumptions in the valuation analysis underlying the Fair Value that was approved by the NBU.  \nI have adjusted my Fair Value assessment of Hotel Zirka accordingly. \n36. For Hotel Mir, I observed that the NBU did not appear to verify a Fair Value for this asset \nunder the tripartite agreement between the Bank, the NBU, and the independent valuation \nfirms.  My Fair Value assessment for Hotel Mir is based on a Fair Value that had been approved \nby the NBU in 2015, the year prior to its transfer to the Bank. \n37.

I believe it will assist the Court to understand these standards of \nvalue and how they are both similar and different.  This should be particularly helpful because \nMr. Bezant (and Mr. Thomas) and I implement different standards of value for the Transferred \nAssets. \nA. Fair Market Value \n40. FMV has its origins in US tax legislation.  Specifically, the term “fair market value” was \nintroduced in the 1916 Revenue Act passed by the US Congress.  The 1916 Revenue Act \nprovided for, inter alia, the application of taxes to estate inheritances.8  The 1916 Revenue Act \ndeclared that the basis upon which inherited property would be valued for tax reporting \npurposes to be “fair market value.”9  The US Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) utilized the \nterm “fair market value” in its tax forms.10  However, neither the US Congress nor the IRS \ndefined FMV nor prescribed a method (or method(s)) upon which it should be measured.  \nIndeed, the IRS initially asked tax filers to describe the manner in which they determined FMV \nthemselves.11 \n41. FMV did not have a recognized definition until 1959 when the IRS passed Revenue Ruling \n59-60.  In that ruling, the IRS defined FMV as: \n  “…the price at which the property would change hands between a \nwilling buyer and a willing seller when the former is not under any \ncompulsion to buy and the latter is not under any compulsion to sell, \nboth parties having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts.”12  \n42. The IRS also provided implementing rules and guidance in Revenue Ruling 59-60 and this \ndocument remains the core set of rules and guidelines today.  These rules and guidelines were \neffectively developed through various contested court proceedings between taxpayers and the \n \n8 Revenue Act of 1916, p. 759 for example. (BK-01) \n9 Revenue Act of 1916, p. 758 for example. (BK-01) \n10 1916 IRS Tax Form, p. 3. (BK-02) \n11 1916 IRS Tax Form, p. 3. (BK-02) \n12 Revenue Ruling 59-60, p. 1. (BK-03) \nD20/1/15\n \nPage 15 \n IRS over the preceding years.  Indeed, Revenue Ruling 59-60 cited previous court decisions in \nproviding some guidance on the calculation: \n“Court decisions frequently state in addition that the hypothetical \nbuyer and seller are assumed to be able, as well as willing, to trade \nand to be well informed about the property and concerning the \nmarket for such property.”13 \n43. Additionally, citing case precedent, the IRS issued a clarification memorandum explaining that \ninformation which was not known or knowable at the valuation date should not factor into a \nFMV calculation. \n“Generally, a valuation of property for Federal transfer tax purpos"}

Additionally, citing case precedent, the IRS issued a clarification memorandum explaining that \ninformation which was not known or knowable at the valuation date should not factor into a \nFMV calculation. \n“Generally, a valuation of property for Federal transfer tax purposes \nis made as of the valuation date without regard to events happening \nafter that date. Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, 279 U.S. 151 \n(1929). Subsequent events may be considered, however, if they are \nrelevant to the question of value. Estate of Noble v. Commissioner, \nT.C. Memo. 2005-2, n.3. Federal law favors the admission of \nprobative evidence, and the test of relevancy under the Federal \nRules of Evidence is designed to achieve that end. Id. Thus, a post-\nvaluation date event may be considered if the event was reasonably \nforeseeable as of the valuation date. Trust Services of America, Inc. \nv. U.S., 885 F.2d 561, 569 (9th Cir. 1989); Bank One Corp., 120 \nT.C. 174, 306. Furthermore, a post-valuation date event, even if \nunforeseeable as of the valuation date, also may be probative of the \nearlier valuation to the extent that it is relevant to establishing the \namount that a hypothetical willing buyer would have paid a \nhypothetical willing seller for the subject property as of the \nvaluation date. See Estate of Gilford v. Commissioner, 88 T.C. 38, \n52-55 (1987).”14 \n44. The rationale of excluding events or information not known or knowable at the investment \nvaluation date is obvious given the purpose of a FMV calculation is to determine a price in a \nhypothetical transaction on the valuation date.  The parties to this hypothetical transaction \ncould not know what was unknown at the moment of the transaction. \n45. While the FMV definition set forth in Revenue Ruling 59-60 remains largely unchanged today, \na continuous flow of cases have been brought before the courts which has resulted in further \ninterpretative guidance. \n \n13 Ibid. \n14 IRS Memorandum dated 28 May 2019, p. 4. (BK-04) \nD20/1/16\n \nPage 16 \n “The purpose of this Revenue Ruling is to outline and review in \ngeneral the approach, methods and factors to be considered in \nvaluing shares of the capital stock of closely held corporations for \nestate tax and gift tax purposes.”15 \n46. The purpose of Revenue Ruling 59-60 was to establish a framework for valuing property or \ninvestments under a hypothetical transaction given that the owner or recipient of the property \nwas subject to a tax on its value.  Both the definition of FMV and the rules and guidelines \nassociated with its proper implementation were developed over many decades through \nnumerous debates within the US courts.  It is this long history of debate and analysis within \nthe US courts that has made FMV such an appealing concept in addressing the question of \n“value.”   \n47. Unsurprisingly, the FMV concept has been adopted internationally given the considerable \neffort that was put forth to develop it within the United States.  FMV is utilized in many bi-\nlateral and multilateral investment treaties.  However, there is not a separate “international” \ndefinition or set of rules and guidelines pertaining to FMV.  The core definition and its rules \nand guidelines remain a product of the US tax code and court decisions resolving disputes \nbetween taxpayers and the IRS.  For example, the International Valuation Standards (“IVS”) \ndeveloped by the International Valuation Standards Council (“IVSC”) specifically refers to US \nlegislation for the definition of FMV. \n“110.

(BK-03) \n16 International Valuation Standards, Effective 31 January 2020, p. 23. (BK-05) The IVS also identifies a highly \ngeneric definition of the FMV according to the OECD.  However, there is no citation provided by the IVS to this \ndefinition.  In fact, the OECD glossary of statistical terms only identifies Fair Value and Market Value.  It does not \ninclude the term FMV. \nD20/1/17\n \nPage 17 \n 48. IRS Revenue Ruling 59-60 is not rigidly prescriptive in addressing the valuation techniques \nthat should be utilized to perform the analysis.  Instead, IRS Revenue Ruling 50-60 provides \ngeneral guidance on this topic.  For example, IRS Revenue Ruling 59-60 states: \n“A determination of fair market value, being a question of fact, will \ndepend upon the circumstances in each case. No formula can be \ndevised that will be generally applicable to the multitude of different \nvaluation issues arising in estate and gift tax cases.”17 \n49. Instead of attempting to providing a strict method of analysis, the IRS identifies the following \nfactors that it is considers to be  fundamental  to any FMV determination. \n“Sec. 4. Factors To Consider. \n.01 It is advisable to emphasize that in the valuation of the stock of \nclosely held corporations or the stock of corporations where market \nquotations are either lacking or too scarce to be recognized, all \navailable financial data, as well as all relevant factors affecting \nthe fair market value, should be considered. The following \nfactors, although not all- inclusive are fundamental and require \ncareful analysis in each case : [emphasis added] \n(a) The nature of the business and the history of the enterprise from \nits inception. \n(b) The economic outlook in general and the condition and outlook \nof the specific industry in particular. \n(c) The book value of the stock and the financial condition of the \nbusiness. \n(d) The earning capacity of the company. \n(e) The dividend-paying capacity. \n(f) Whether or not the enterprise has goodwill or other intangible \nvalue. \n(g) Sales of the stock and the size of the block of stock to be valued. \n(h) The market price of stocks of corporations engaged in the same \nor a similar line of business having their stocks actively traded in a \nfree and open market, either on an exchange or over-the-counter.”18 \n \n17 Revenue Ruling 59-60, p. 1. (BK-03) \n18 Revenue Ruling 59-60, p. 2. (BK-03) \nD20/1/18\n \nPage 18 \n 50. Items (d) and (e) above clearly refer to a valuation in accordance with the DCF or Income \nApproach.  Item (h) above clearly refers to a valuation in accordance with the Market \nApproach.  These are the two fundamental valuation approaches recognized by the IRS for \nFMV determinations.  Practitioners also consider what is commonly referred to as the Asset \nBased Approach.19  The Asset Based Approach essentially is an approach whereby all of the \nindividual assets and liabilities of the company are valued separately.  Since each asset and \nliability is valued separately, a valuation technique is obviously required.  Usually, each asset \nand liability is valued using either the DCF, Market or Cost Approach. \nB.

Like FMV, Market Value also excludes consideration of special circumstances when \nconsidering the hypothetical transaction. \n“The definition of Market Value must be applied in accordance with \nthe following conceptual framework: \n(a) “The estimated amount” refers to a price expressed in terms of \nmoney payable for the asset in an arm’s length market transaction. \nMarket Value is the most probable price reasonably obtainable in \nthe market on the valuation date in keeping with the market value \ndefinition. It is the best price reasonably obtainable by the seller and \nthe most advantageous price reasonably obtainable by the buyer. \nThis estimate specifically excludes an estimated price inflated or \ndeflated by special terms or circumstances such as atypical \nfinancing, sale and leaseback arrangements, special considerations \nor Contracts granted by anyone associated with the sale, or any \nelement of value available only to a specific owner or purchaser.”21 \n \n19 Pratt, Shannon P., “Valuing a Business: The Analysis and Appraisal of Closely Held Companies,” Fifth Edition, \n2008, p. 349. (BK-06) \n20 International Valuation Standards, Effective 31 January 2020, p. 18. (BK-05) \n21 International Valuation Standards, Effective 31 January 2020, pp. 18-19. (BK-05) \nD20/1/19\n \nPage 19 \n 53. Like FMV, Market Value must be measured at the valuation date using only known or \nknowable information at that time. \n“On the valuation date” requires that the value is time-specific as of \na given date. Because markets and market conditions may change, \nthe estimated value may be incorrect or inappropriate at another \ntime. The valuation amount will reflect the market state and \ncircumstances as at the valuation date, not those at any other date.”22 \n54. There are three critical aspects of the definition of Market Value. \n55. First, the price determined under a Market Value analysis is the result of a simulated sales \nprocess.  It is presumed that the property has been appropriately exposed to the market for sale \nsuch that buyer interest can be generated.23  This means that the sales process is presumed to \nhave begun well before the valuation date, even though no marketing has actually taken place \n(similar to the requirement of a knowledgeable buyer in at FMV analysis).   \n56. Second, the buyer and seller are presumed to be acting prudently and for self-interest.  This \nmeans, for example, that the seller wishes to obtain the highest price possible and the buyer \nthe lowest price possible.  The price upon which the parties settle is obviously in the middle of \nthese two opposing objectives.  The buyer and seller are not compelled.  The sales process is \nthus not one involving a forced sale or an impulsive purchase.24 \n57. Third, the aim of a proper Market Value analysis is to ascertain the price that would be agreed \nby the buyer and seller under typical conditions that would yield a “fair sale.”  Thus, external \nevents and circumstances that might affect a decision to buy or sell a property under conditions \nthat would not yield a fair sale should be excluded from the analysis.

In essence, the price \ndetermined under a Market Value analysis is the product of an orderly transaction process.   \n58. Market Value and FMV are often consistent in implementation and result.  Thus, implementing \nprinciples and guidelines associated with FMV are often useful when implementing the Market \nValue standard.  However, the Market Value standard includes one important differentiating \nfactor.  Market Value incorporates the concept of highest and best use .  Highest and best use  \nis described as: \n \n22 International Valuation Standards, Effective 31 January 2020, p. 19. (BK-05) \n23 International Valuation Standards, Effective 31 January 2020, p. 19. (BK-05) \n24 International Valuation Standards, Effective 31 January 2020, pp. 18-19. (BK-05) \nD20/1/20\n \nPage 20 \n “The reasonably probable use of property that results in the highest \nvalue…The use of an asset that maximizes its potential…The \nhighest and best use may be for the continuation of an asset’s \nexisting use or for some alternative use.  This is determined by the \nuse that a market participant would have in mind for the asset when \nformulating the price that it would be willing to bid.”25   \n59. The highest and best use  principle is not usually relevant with respect to the valuation of \nfinancial assets.  It is, however, a core element and principle that must be considered in the \nvaluation of real estate and properties. \n“Highest and best use is the use, from a participant perspective, that \nwould produce the highest value for an asset. Although the concept \nis most frequently applied to non-financial assets as many financial \nassets do not have alternative uses, there may be circumstances \nwhere the highest and best use of financial assets needs to be \nconsidered.”26 \n60. Thus, whereas shares in a business would be valued based upon the current and expected \noperation of the underlying company, property appraisal must also consider any alternative or \nadditional uses of the property that may result in a higher value.   \n61. There are four factors that must be considered and analyzed when employing the highest and \nbest use principle in real estate appraisal. \n“The four criteria that the highest and best use must meet are [1] \nlegal permissibility, [2] physical possibility, [3] financial feasibility, \nand [4] maximum productivity.”27    \n62. Physical possibility is somewhat self-explanatory.  One cannot consider the value of ¼ acre of \nland as if it were developed into a 500 room luxury hotel since the hotel would not fit the \nfootprint of the available land.  Financial feasibility means that the value of the land use must \nexceed the cost of the land and its proposed development.  In other words, the development \nmust yield a profit.  Maximum productivity means that the development must yield the \nmaximum amount of profit possible.  Legal permissibility is described as: \n“a property use that is either currently allowed or most probably \nallowable under the zoning codes, building codes, environmental \n \n25 The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, Sixth Edition, p. 109.

(BK-05) \nD20/1/21\n \nPage 21 \n regulations, and other applicable laws and regulations that govern \nland use.”28  \n63. The most notable aspect of the legal permissibility  concept is that it does not limit the value or \nthe property to its current use, but instead considers all possible uses that are not prohibited \nunder existing regulations that would maximize the value.  In essence, an appraiser is to assume \nany possible use within the existing regulations and codes.   \n64. When possible uses are not entirely clear, appraisers will often look at the development rights \nafforded to adjacent or comparably situated properties for guidance.  It is not required to have \nabsolute certainty that the development would receive all necessary permits for the use which \nmaximizes profits and value.  In practical terms, this means that the appraiser need not obtain \nassurance from the appropriate authorities that the maximum profitable use of the property will \nbe approved.  Rather, the appraiser need only determine the maximum profitable use is not \ncurrently prohibited.  Embedded within the most probable use assumption is that the regulatory \nauthorities will not act unreasonably or in a discriminatory manner in denying such a use.  \n65. When employed, the highest and best use  principle ensures that the Market Value \ndetermination of the property is the highest possible value.  A simple example demonstrates \nhow the highest and best use  principle is employed.  In the past several years, the Manhattan \nBorough of New York City has seen an exodus of petrol stations.  This has been a consequence \nof gas filling station owners recognizing that the value of the property upon which their \noperation resides is more valuable as if sold to a developer to construct apartment buildings or \ncommercial offices than the value of the operations of the petrol station.  Under the FMV \nstandard, one would value the petrol station as it exists.  Under the Market Value standard, the \nhighest and best use  principle dictates that the petrol station is valued at the higher of the \nexisting operations or the sale of the underlying real estate for a purpose that might realize a \nhigher value. \n66. To value the underlying real estate for an alternative purpose, it may be necessary to project \nthe cash flow that could be generated by the property from the alternative use (if a sale of \nsimilar property is not identifiable).  Thus, even though the alternative use for the property \ndoes not currently exist on the property, an appropriate valuation analysis under the Market \n \n28 The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, Sixth Edition, p. 129. (BK-07) \nD20/1/22\n \nPage 22 \n Value standard would be to estimate the economic benefits of such a use.  In our example \nabove, a perfectly acceptable valuation analysis for the petrol station property would be to \nestimate the demolition costs of the petrol station, the construction costs of an apartment \ncomplex, and sales proceeds that could be derived from each apartment sale, plus a reasonable \nprofit margin for the developer.  After quantifying these factors, and accounting for the time it \nwould take to construct and sell the apartment units (i.e., a DCF analysis), one can quantify the \nreasonable price a developer should pay for the real estate underlying the petrol station.    \n67. There are three recognized techniques for determining the Market Value of real estate assets \nthat all valuers consider in conducting their analysis: 1) the Cost Approach, 2) the Sales \nComparison Approach (also referred to as the Market Approach); and 3) Income Approach \n(also referred to as the DCF Approach).  The Appraisal Institute describes the conceptual basis \nfor each of these valuation techniques, respectively, in the three bullets as follows. \n“P"}

There are three recognized techniques for determining the Market Value of real estate assets \nthat all valuers consider in conducting their analysis: 1) the Cost Approach, 2) the Sales \nComparison Approach (also referred to as the Market Approach); and 3) Income Approach \n(also referred to as the DCF Approach).  The Appraisal Institute describes the conceptual basis \nfor each of these valuation techniques, respectively, in the three bullets as follows. \n“Participants in the real estate market commonly think of value in \nthree ways: \n• The current cost of reproducing or replacing a building, minus an \nestimate for depreciation, plus the value of the land (and \nentrepreneurial incentive, if applicable) \n• The value indicated by recent sales of comparable properties in the \nmarket \n• The value that the property’s net earning power will support \nThese different viewpoints form the basis of the three approaches \nthat appraisers use to value property—the cost, sales comparison \nand income capitalization approaches.”29 \n68. The above concepts of value are represented in application by the Cost Approach, Market \nApproach, and Income Approach, respective.  The IVS specifically recognizes these three \nvaluation techniques as applicable. \n“Consideration must be given to the relevant and appropriate \nvaluation approaches. The three approaches described and defined \nbelow are the main approaches used in valuation. They are all based \non the economic principles of price equilibrium, anticipation of \nbenefits or substitution. \n \n29 Understanding the Appraisal, Appraisal Institute, 2013, pp. 6-7. (BK-08) \nD20/1/23\n \nPage 23 \n The principal valuation approaches are: \n(a) market approach, \n(b) income approach, and \n(c) cost approach.30 \n69. Thus, the appraiser should consider each of these techniques and determine which is most \napplicable for the subject property.  In some cases, more than one approach may be utilized to \nachieve mutually reinforcing Market Value conclusions.  Often the Income and the Sales \nComparison Approaches may be used in tandem.  Likewise, the Sales Comparison and the \nCost Approach may sometimes be used in tandem.  The Appraisal Institute recognizes that \ncertain approaches will not be applicable to all types of real estate projects. \n “One or more of these approaches may not be applicable to a given \nassignment or may be less significant because of the nature of the \nproperty, the appraisal problem or the data available. The \napproaches to value are applied within the context of the valuation \nprocess.”31     \nC. Fair Value \n70. Fair value, as used in US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) and \nInternational Accounting Standards (“IAS”) is another standard of value that is essentially \nidentical to FMV.  While FMV has its origins in US tax law, Fair Value has its origins in \naccounting standards.  Accounting professionals decided to adopt the label “Fair Value” \ninstead of FMV to avoid the necessity of referring to US tax court decisions regarding the \nimplementation of FMV (accounting rules and standards are not the product of legislative \ndecisions, but rather those of the business community).  Nevertheless, the objective of the Fair \nValue standard is to emulate the FMV standard.  The following statement from the Financial \nAccounting Standards Board (“FASB”) explains the desire of the Board to align the Fair Value \nstandard with the FMV standard without the need to import the accompanying case law.   \n“The Board agreed that the measurement objective encompassed in \nthe definition of fair value used for financial reporting purposes is \ngenerally consistent with similar definitions of fair market value \nused for valuation purposes.  For example, the definition of fair \n \n30 International Valuation Standards, Effective 31 January 2020, p. 29. (BK-05) \n31 Understanding the Appraisal, Appraisal Institute, 2013, p. 7.

Further, the definition has a significant body of \ninterpretive case law, developed in the context of tax regulation.  \nBecause such interpretive case law, in the context of financial \nreporting, may not be relevant, the Board chose not to adopt the \ndefinition of fair market value, and its interpretive case law, for \nfinancial reporting purposes.”32  \n71. As such, Fair Value is for all intents and purposes consistent with FMV.  However, Fair Value \nis more prescriptive in its implementation that either FMV or Market Value.  I describe the \nimportant aspects of Fair Value in the following paragraphs. \n72. The original definition of Fair Value, similar to Fair Market Value, was: \n“the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability \nsettled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length \ntransaction.”33 \n73. This definition has been slightly modified more recently (without any significantly meaningful \ndifference) to focus on an exit price rather than entry price.34  Fair value considers the principal \nmarket in which the asset or liability would normally trade and if no principle market exists, \nthe most advantageous market.35   \n74. Fair Value is a “market-based” measure, not an entity-specific measure (i.e., a measure \naccording to the perspective of a specific buyer or seller).36  This means that Fair Value should \nbe determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or \nliability.37  This is an important distinction because many valuation authorities and text books \n \n32 Valuing a Business: The Analysis and Appraisal of Closely Held Companies – Fourth Edition, Pratt, Reilly & \nSchweihs, McGraw-Hill, 2000, p. 46.

For example, \nwhen Prof. Damodaran discusses the Relative Valuation Approach (his terminology for the \nMarket Approach) he explicitly notes: \n“In relative valuation, we have given up on estimating intrinsic \nvalue and essentially put our trust in markets getting it right, at least \non average.”38 \n75. FMV, Market Value and Fair Value are ONLY concerned with market oriented measures of \nvalue, no matter how wrong an analyst may view that value to be.  Thus, when using a valuation \napproach or technique, these standards of value must be executed from a market perspective, \nnot an individual analyst’s perspective. \n76. Like FMV, Fair Value assumes a hypothetical, orderly transaction where the asset or liability \nhas been afforded the appropriate exposure time to the market.39  In other words, it is not a \ncompulsory, rash, hurried, or uninformed sale.  It is a simulation of an orderly sale.  Fair Value \nalso assumes the sale or transfer of an asset or liability, not a transaction to offset the risks \nassociated with the asset or liability.40  \n77. Also, Fair Value does not change based upon the level of transaction activity in the exit (or \ntransactional) market. \n“The objective of a fair value measure does not change based upon \nthe level of activity in the exit market or the valuation technique(s) \nused.  That is, fair value remains a market-based exit price that \nconsiders the current market conditions as at the measurement date, \neven if there has been a significant decrease in the volume of activity \nfor the asset or liability.”41   \n78. The reason a Fair Value estimate does not change based upon the activity for similar companies \nin the marketplace is because a Fair Value estimate, like a FMV estimate, assumes the presence \nof a willing buyer.  Indeed, Fair Value guidance cautions that the price of similar assets or \n \n38 Aswath Damodaran, “An Introduction to Valuation,” p. 23.

Fair Value recognizes three core valuation techniques. \n“IFRS 13 recognises three valuation approaches to measure fair \nvalue: \n• Market approach: based on market transactions involving identical \nor similar assets or liabilities \n• Income approach: based on future amounts (e.g., cash flows or \nincome and expenses) that are converted (discounted) to a single \npresent amount \n• Cost approach: based on the amount required to replace the service \ncapacity of an asset (frequently referred to as current replacement \ncost)”43 \n80. Importantly, Fair Value does not prioritize valuation techniques or approaches (i.e., the DCF \nApproach over the Market Approach or vice-a-versa) as being more reliable than another.  \nInstead, Fair Value prioritizes the technique or approach that makes maximum use of market-\nbased inputs in the valuation analysis.   \n“Second, IFRS 13 does not prioritise the use of one valuation \ntechnique over another, unlike existing IFRSs, or require the use of \nonly one technique (with the exception of the requirement to \nmeasure identical financial instruments that trade in active markets \nat PxQ). Instead, the standard establishes a hierarchy for the inputs \nused in those valuation techniques, requiring an entity to maximise \nobservable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs (the \nfair value hierarchy is discussed further in Chapter 15).”4"}

(BK-10) \nD20/1/27\n \nPage 27 \n 81. This is codified in a valuation hierarchy.  There are three levels to the hierarchy (Level 1, 2, \nand 3).45  Fair value must be measured at the highest possible level available (Level 1 being \nthe highest and Level 3 the lowest). \n82. Quoted prices in an active market for identical assets and liabilities represent a Level 1 \nmeasurement.46  Quoted prices in inactive markets or valuation techniques which rely upon \nobservable market-based inputs generally represent a Level 2 measurement.47  Valuation \ntechniques that rely upon unobservable inputs represent a Level 3 measurement.48  This \nhierarchy is depicted in Figure 2 below. \nFigure 2 – Fair Value Hierarchy \n \n83. In all levels of the hierarchy, Fair Value requires the maximum use of observable market-based \ninputs. \n“Regardless of the valuation techniques used to estimate fair value, \nIFRS 13 requires that they maximize the use of relevant observable \ninputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs.  This \nrequirement is consistent with the idea that fair value is a market-\nbased measurement and, therefore, is determined using market-\nbased observable data, to the extent available and relevant.49   \n84. To sum up, in a given valuation analysis, if the Market Approach incorporates more market-\nbased inputs (or is less dependent upon unobservable inputs) than the DCF Approach, Fair \nValue would consider the Market Approach as a better measure of Fair Value.

A \nvaluation technique will be deemed superior to another only if that technique is reliant on the \nfewest number of non-market (i.e., unobservable) based inputs. \nD. The Advantages of the Fair Value Standard \n85. The Fair Value standard has three distinct advantages over the FMV or Market Value \nstandards. \n86. First, while FMV and Market Value allow the valuers to choose which valuation technique to \nimplement, Fair Value requires valuers to utilize the technique that is most objective and least \nsubjective.  As I just explained, Fair Value does not prioritize one technique over the other on \na conceptual basis.  Instead, Fair Value favors the technique which incorporates the most \nobservable market-based inputs (and fewest unobservable inputs). \n87. Second, Fair Value requires valuers to maximize the use of observable market-based inputs \nwhen executing each valuation technique.  While this would generally be considered good \nvaluation practice, FMV and Market Value do not have this requirement and do not place \nemph"}

Second, Fair Value requires valuers to maximize the use of observable market-based inputs \nwhen executing each valuation technique.  While this would generally be considered good \nvaluation practice, FMV and Market Value do not have this requirement and do not place \nemphasis on it. \n88. Third, the categorization of each Fair Value calculation as Level 1, 2, or 3 is unique to the Fair \nValue standard and provides additional important information about the calculation that \nMarket Value and FMV do not.  For example, Level 1 Fair Values are entirely objective \nmeasures of value, given that Level 1 relies upon quoted prices for the asset in active markets.  \nLevel 2 Fair Values less are objective, but still significantly objective because the valuation \ntechnique employed relies substantially on observable market-based inputs.  Level 3 Fair \nValues are regarded as far more subjective than objective.  A Level 3 Fair Value signals that \nthe calculation could differ materially depending upon the unobservable inputs chosen in the \nvaluation technique.      \nE. Auditing Fair Value \n89. I believe it would assist the Court if I first explain a few basic auditing concepts and then \naddress specifically how Fair Value calculations are audited as there are often a number of \nmisconceptions in this regard.   \nD20/1/29\n \nPage 29 \n 90. Many lay persons hold the misconception that auditors actually prepare the financial \nstatements on behalf of a company.  This of course is not correct.  It is always management’s \nresponsibility to prepare the financial statements.  It is the auditor’s responsible to evaluate the \nfinancial statements and determine whether or not they have been prepared in accordance with \nall of the applicable accounting rules.  If an auditor prepared the financial statements, the \nauditor would be testing their own work. \n91. An auditor is not a proctor either.  Auditors do not review the financial statements looking for \nerrors in order to issue qualified opinions on them.  If an auditor finds an issue during a review, \nit is brought to the attention of management and management will make the necessary \nadjustments. As such, the objective of both the auditor and management is to receive a clean, \nunqualified audit opinion.   In fact, auditors do not just appear at the end of the year to perform \ntheir review of management’s accounting.  If management has a query on how to record a \nparticular transaction during the year, the auditor is there to provide guidance.  \n92. With respect to Fair Value calculations, the auditor’s role is just the same – to ensure that the \nFair Value calculation is compliant with the applicable accounting rules.  As mentioned in the \nprior section, those rules are reflected in IFRS 13.  As such, the first step in any review is to \napply the Fair Value hierarchy.  The auditor must determine the highest level of the hierarchy \nat which an asset can be valued (Level 1, 2, or 3) and ensure management has measured it at \nthat level.  For example, if an asset is actively traded in the market, Fair Value must be \nmeasured at the prices observable for that asset in that market – not with a valuation technique.   \n93. If an asset is not actively traded, a valuation technique must be employed.  The valuation \ntechnique to be employed must be the one that relies upon the fewest unobservable inputs (or \nconversely, relies upon the most observable market inputs).  As such, the auditor would \nevaluate if management adopted the valuation technique that was least reliant upon \nunobservable inputs.   \n94. If an auditor believes a valuation technique was properly chosen, but some unobservable inputs \nwere utilized when observable inputs were available, the auditor would bring that to the \natt"}

If an auditor believes a valuation technique was properly chosen, but some unobservable inputs \nwere utilized when observable inputs were available, the auditor would bring that to the \nattention of management because the rule, as discussed above, is that any valuation technique \nmust make maximum use of observable market inputs.   \nD20/1/30\n \nPage 30 \n 95. The balance between observable and unobservable inputs utilized in a valuation technique will \ndetermine whether the Fair Value calculation will be categorized as Level 2 or 3.  There is no \nrule in this regard to determine whether the technique qualifies as Level 2 or 3.  The decision \nrequires some judgment.   \n96. When a valuation technique is employed that properly relies upon substantial unobservable \ninputs (because little if any observable market inputs are available), the Fair Value calculation \nwill be categorized as Level 3.  \n97. At all levels of the hierarchy, but particularly for valuation techniques., an auditor will check \nthe math and integrity of the calculation.  Importantly, however, it is not the auditor’s role to \nsubstitute their own personal or professional views on the use of unobservable inputs.  For \nexample, it is not an auditor’s role to question certain inputs into a discount rate calculation \n(such as which beta input or market risk premium input should be utilized in the capital asset \npricing model), adjust management’s projections of sales or cash flows, or determine whether \na particular asset is sufficiently comparable or not when using the Market Approach.  In other \nwords, the auditor does not make modifications to the valuation technique to fit their own \npreference.   \n98. That said, if an auditor believes that certain parameters of a calculation are rather dubious, this \nwould be brought to management’s attention.  If management is still comfortable with those \nassumptions, the matter may end there.  However, if auditor believes the Fair Value calculation \ncontains a high level of uncertainty, the auditor may issue an “Emphasis of Matter” opinion.  \nThis is not a qualified opinion.  Rather, it is a generic notification in the audit letter which \ninforms the financial statement reader that there are Fair Value calculations which make use \nof substantial unobservable inputs such that the calculation contains of level of risk worthy of \nattention. \n99. The overarching point I wish to make in regard to this discussion is that an auditor’s job is not \nto determine whether a Fair Value calculation, properly categorized as Level 3, is right or \nwrong, but only that it complies with IFRS 13.  As such, two companies holding unlisted shares \nin the same entity may reach different, indeed substantially different, Fair Value calculations \nfor the same shares and both would be deemed correct.  This situation can occur quite often \nD20/1/31\n \nPage 31 \n when employing the Income Approach given the large impact small differences in the discount \nrate can generate.            \n The Appropriate Standard of Value for the Transferred Assets is Fair \nValue, Not Market Value \n100. Fair Value, not Market Value, applies to the Transferred Assets.  I note that Mr. Bezant has \ntaken an instruction, and by extension Mr. Thomas as well, to apply Market Value.  This is \nincorrect. \n101. PrivatBank prepares and presents its financial statements under IFRS.   \nFigure 3 -PrivatBank Disclosure of the Application of IFRS50 \n \n102.

As the Transferred Assets are classified as held for sale, the Fair Value standard applies to \nthem.  It is also evident that Fair Value applies to the Transferred Assets when reviewing the \nPrivatBank financial statements in more detail.  For example, PrivatBank labels the \nTransferred Assets as “Repossessed Collateral.”  In the PrivatBank financial statements from \n2016 to 2018, PrivatBank includes the following accounting policy note with regard to \nRepossessed Collateral. \nFigure 4 – Example of 2018 Accounting Policy Statement51 \n \n103.     As a further example, in the 2018 PrivatBank Financial Statement, Note 29 “Fair Value of \nFinancial Instruments,” the Repossessed Collateral is included.  \n \n50 PrivatBank 2018 Financial Statements, p. 6.

The line-item Repossessed Collateral with a Fair Value of UAH 1,361 million, classified as \na Level 3 measurement, represents the Transferred Assets after the assets were remeasured in \n2018 at Fair Value.  I will show and discuss how PrivatBank remeasured Fair Value for the \nTransferred Assets from 2016 to 2018 in the following section. \n105. Nevertheless, it appears evident that Messrs. Bezant and Thomas are not aware that Fair \nValue applies to the Transferred Assets.  While Fair Value and Market Value are very similar \nstandards of value, as I explained in the prior section, Fair Value is more prescriptive in its \nimplementation than Market Value.  There are important implications that follow from the \napplication of Fair Value to the Transferred Assets rather than Market Value. \n106. First, as I will discuss in Section VII, Mr. Thomas rejects the Cost Approach as a valid \nvaluation technique for the Dnipro Stadium and Dnipro Training Center.  He instead argues \n \n52 PrivatBank 2018 Financial Statements, p. 81. (MB-A119)  \nD20/1/33\n \nPage 33 \n that the Income Approach should apply even though he has no evidence of the historical \nincome or costs associated with either.  As I have explained, Fair Value does not prioritize \nvaluation techniques.  Instead, Fair Value dictates that the valuation technique which makes \nmaximum use of observable inputs is the appropriate valuation technique. With regard to these \ntwo assets, cost information was available and observable.  No data specific to the Dnipro \nStadium or the Training Facility was available.  As such, Mr. Thomas should have applied the \nCost Approach (as was done originally in 2016). \n107. Moreover, given that the Transferred Assets were all (properly in my view) classified as \nLevel 3 measures of Fair Value, an informed financial statement reader would understand that \nthe measure is based upon significant unobservable inputs and could vary significantly. \n The EY Report & the 2016 to 2018 Audits by EY of PrivatBank \n108. In this section I provide the Court with an overview of a report issued by EY on 22 November \n2016 (the “EY Report”) which, among other matters, addressed the Fair Values of the \nTransferred Assets.  I also provide the Court with an overview of PrivatBank’s Fair Value \naccounting for the Transferred Assets from 2016 to 2018 and comment on audits conducted by \nEY from 2016 to 2018 in relation to the Transferred Assets.    \nA.

One of EY’s tasks was to review the Fair Value of assets repossessed by the Bank (“Global \nRepossessed Assets”).  I should note that the Transferred Assets are only a subset of the Global \nRepossessed Assets, and one should bear that in mind when reviewing the EY Report.   \n111. In relation to the Global Repossessed Assets. EY reviewed the Fair Value of a substantial \nsample of the assets that had been validated by the NBU as well as additional assets not \nreviewed by the NBU. \n“In accordance with the terms of engagement of the assignment, EY \nconducted a desk review of the fair value of repossessed properties \nand the use of proper legal procedures for foreclosing on properties \n \n53 EY Report, p. 2. \nD20/1/34\n \nPage 34 \n held as collateral. This review involved a spot audit. Sampling \nprinciple: covering 85% of the value validated by the NBU and \nproperties worth more than UAH 200 million that were not validated \nby the NBU.”54  \n112. Based upon my review of the EY Report, it does not appear that their desk review considered \nIFRS 13, and in particular, the selection of a valuation technique which contains the fewest \nunobservable inputs.  I note EY describes its review more generally as follows. \n“According to the information we received, the NBU established \nadditional restrictions for the methodological approaches applied for \nvaluing collateral and tangible assets repossessed by the Bank. We \nconducted a desk review of the fair value of assets using generally \naccepted practices to the extent that they do not conflict with \nNational Valuation Standards.”55 \n113. As already shown in Figure 1 above, the NBU validated the Fair Value of UAH 32 billion in \nTransferred Assets by assigning a Fair Value to them of UAH 31.5 billion. The NBU \napparently did not review the other UAH 14 billion of assets.  For convenience I show the \nresults of the NBU’s validation below in Figure 6. \n \n54 EY Report, p. 13. \n55 EY Report, p. 4. \nD20/1/35\n \nPage 35 \n Figure 6 – NBU Validation of UAH 32 Billion in Transferred Assets56 \n \n114.

I have four observations after reviewing the EY Report in respect of its desk review. \n117. First, as indicated in Figure 8 above, EY provided a range of Fair Values for all asset \ncategories.  In some cases the range is substantial such as with certain Petrol Stations and OSFs.  \nThis would not be surprising if the Fair Value calculations would only qualify as a Level 3 \nvaluation (i.e., substantial unobservable inputs utilized in the valuation technique). \n118. Second, some of the differences identified by EY would, in my opinion, fall into the category \nof professional disagreement.  For example, EY disagreed with certain comparable properties \nutilized to value “33 land plots in the Odesa region.”58  Whether or not a property is sufficiently \ncomparable is often subjective and a matter on which valuation professionals may reasonably \ndisagree. \n \n58 EY Report, p. 43. \nD20/1/38\n \nPage 38 \n 119.

Third, some of the adjustments EY suggested mirror adjustments the NBU had already \nidentified.59  As such, these adjustments were not additional issues that had not already been \nidentified. \n120. Fourth, EY expressed its opinion that the Income Approach should be utilized to value the \nDnipro Stadium rather than the Cost Approach because the Cost Approach does not represent \nMarket Value. \n“Dnepr Arena Stadium Fair value at initial recognition - 1 517 \nmillion UAH Verified by NBU - UAH 1 543 million From our point \nof view the value calculation must include the income-base \napproach, as the cost approach for a stadium does not reflect the \nproperty’s market value. As no data about the stadium’s activities \n(income and costs) was available, we are unable to provide any \ncomments within the framework of this desk review. We \nrecommend a revaluation.”60 \n121. I strongly disagree with the statement.  As I showed in Section III above, all of the \ninternationally recognized standards accept the Cost Approach as a valid measure of Market \nValue.  More importantly, Fair Value determinations, as I explained, require the use of the \nvaluation technique which uses the fewest number of unobservable inputs.  EY recognized no \nincome or operating cost data was available.  I do not know why that was so.  However, in the \nabsence of such data, the Cost Approach would be the preferred valuation technique since the \ncost data is observable. \n122. Moreover, EY contradicts itself with respect to the validity of the Cost Approach.  In the \nAppendices of the EY Report concerning their desk review of the OSFs, EY criticizes one of \nthe valuers for rejecting the Cost Approach given the validity of it. \n“The valuation did not employ a cost (asset-based) approach, which \nthe report explained by citing that this approach was not suitable for \nsuch subject properties. However, given the principle of substitution \nwhich states that a prudent investor will not pay more for an asset \nthan the cost of acquiring or creating a similar asset, and as such the \ncost (asset) approach makes it possible to double check results from \nthe other approaches.”61 \n \n59 EY Report, p. 43. \n60 EY Report, p. 45. \n61 EY Report, p. 241. \nD20/1/39\n \nPage 39 \n 123. I agree with EY’s statement above with the exception that the Cost Approach is not merely \na technique to double check the results from other valuation techniques.  It is an approach on \npar with both the Income and Market Approaches. \n124. Again, I would like to emphasize that, while EY is in some instances critical of the Fair Value \ncalculations prepared by the valuers employed by PrivatBank in 2016, their criticisms often \nreflect the views of one valuation professional versus another.  Indeed, I have my own \ncriticisms of EY’s views.  Thus, criticisms do not render the valuations performed by the \nvaluation professionals non-compliant with IFRS 13.  That is the lens through which EY ought \nto have prepared the desk review in my view.   \n125. In my review, I generally found the valuations performed by the independent valuers to be \nreasonable.  I discuss this more in Section VII.  In any event, I understand that under the tri-\npartite agreement, the NBU was afforded an opportunity to weigh in on the valuations and it \nclearly appears that it did so from the EY Report. \nB.

I have summarized the accounting as \nwell as the restated accounting in Table 2 below. \nTable 2 – Summary of PrivatBank’s Accounting for the Transferred Assets62 \n \n127. As Table 2 above indicates, the Transferred Assets were initially recorded at Fair Values \ntotaling UAH 21,836 million in 2016.  I identified a potential discrepancy or error with this \n \n62 PrivatBank 2016 Financial Statements, p. 34. (MB-A117) ; PrivatBank 2017 Financial Statements, p. 34.

The Transferred Assets should have totaled UAH 17,181 million which \nincludes UAH 6,341 million for the Petrol Stations, UAH 5,685 million for the OSFs, and \nUAH 5,155 million for the Real Estate.  In fact, this is the same amount Mr. Bezant includes \nin the third column of Table 3-2 in his report as shown in Table 3 below. \nTable 3 – Mr. Bezant’s Table 3-2 \n \n128. However, the amount stated at year end in PrivatBank’s balance sheet (UAH 21,836) \nmatches the amount included in column 2 of Mr. Bezant’s table.  However, column 2 includes \nUAH 7,379 million for the real estate even though this amount was allegedly reduced to UAH \n5,155 million before year end according to Claimant.63  Additionally, column 2 includes the \nsales price for the Aircraft.  According to Mr. Bezant, the Aircraft were only on the balance \nsheet one day in August 2016 before they were sold.64  Thus, the Fair Value of the Aircraft \nshould not have been on the balance sheet at year end 2016. \n129. I understand the Aircraft were sold on credit.  Therefore, one possible explanation for \nAircraft price being included on the balance sheet at year end 2016 is that amount represents \nthe loan value associated with the sale.  However, the Transferred Assets are classified as non-\nfinancial assets and a loan represents a financial asset.  I noted there was a reclassification of \nUAH 3,069 million in Repossessed Collateral in 2017 to a different asset category.  It is unclear \nif the reclassification represents the Aircraft loan.  The loan amount and the reclassified amount \ndo not match.  Moreover, the reclassification should have taken place in 2016 not 2017.  As \nsuch, I am unable to resolve this issue without further information.    \n \n63 Mr. Bezant’s Letter of Instruction.

I have not seen the detailed Fair Value calculations supporting the \nremeasured Fair Values in 2017 with one exception.  Mr. Bezant has provided details of the \nPetrol Station Fair Values in 2017 from outside valuers.65  These outside valuers remeasured \nthe Fair Value of the Petrol Stations from UAH 6,431 million in 2016 to UAH 1,863 million \nwhich is UAH 4,568 million or 71 percent lower.  The difference between the full decrease in \nFair Value measures from 2016 to 2017 of UAH 10,568 million less UAH 4,568 million \nexplained by the Petrol Stations is around UAH 6,000 million.  This round adjustment also \nappears rather anomalous.  Absent further information, I am not able to understand the \nremeasured Fair Values of the OSFs and Real Estate. \n131. In 2018, the Transferred Assets were remeasured at Fair Values totaling just UAH 1,361 \nmillion.  I note that in the 2018 PrivatBank financial statements, the Transferred Asset Fair \nValues were also restated in 2016 and 2017.66  For 2016, the Fair Values were restated at UAH \n8,782 million (UAH 13,055 million or approximately 60 percent lower than the original Fair \nValues).  However, Mr. Bezant’s Table 3-2 states that the restated Fair Values for 2016 totaled \nUAH 3,831 million, a difference of UAH 4,951 million.  I am unable to resolve this \ndiscrepancy. \n132. For 2017, the Fair Values were restated at UAH 7,069 million.67  Also, UAH 3,069 million \nwas reclassified (i.e., moved out of the category of “Repossessed Collateral”).  I am not certain \nwhich Transferred Assets were reclassified, but as mentioned earlier, it could be the Aircraft \nloan. \n133. If the reclassified amount is added back to the total Fair Value of the Transferred Asset \nbalance at year end 2018 (i.e., UAH 3,069 million + UAH 1,361 million), the total is UAH \n4,430 million.  Comparing this adjusted Fair Value total with the original 2016 Fair Value total \nof UAH 21,837 million indicates the Fair Values were reduced by UAH 17,407 million or 80 \npercent. \n \n65 See Bezant Transferred Assets Report, Appendix 10a. \n66 PrivatBank 2018 Financial Statements, p. 11. (MB-A119)  \n67 PrivatBank 2018 Financial Statements, p. 11. (MB-A119)  \nD20/1/42\n \nPage 42 \n 134. The above analysis indicates that there are a number of apparent discrepancies that I am \nunable to resolve without further information or explanation. \n135. I have one further comment on the Fair Value accounting.  For 2018, Mr. Bezant has provided \nFair Value measures for only 12 of the 246 Petrol Stations.  I do not know if that is because \nthe valuations for the remaining 234 Petrol Stations could not be found by PrivatBank or if the \nvaluations were not conducted.  However, I note that the Fair Values for all 12 Petrol Stations \nincreased modestly over the 2017 Fair Values. \nC. The EY Audit Opinions  \n136. EY expressed a qualified audit opinion with respect to the 2016 PrivatBank financial \nstatements.  As one of many reasons for the qualified opinion, EY cited a lack of audit evidence \nfor the Transferred Assets. \n“As at 31 December 2016, the Group recognised repossessed \nproperties of UAH 21,356 million within repossessed collateral, \nUAH 1,095 million within investment property and UAH 266 \nmillion within premises, leasehold improvements, equipment and \nintangibles. As described in Note 28 to the consolidated financial \nstatements, in 2016 repossessed collateral with a value of UAH \n7,103 million was settled against derivatives embedded in loans \nissued to customers. We were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate \naudit evidence in respect of the fair value of repossessed \nproperties.”68 \n137. As a general matter, I am not surprised by the 2016 financial statements receiving a qualified \naudit opinion.

We were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate \naudit evidence in respect of the fair value of repossessed \nproperties.”68 \n137. As a general matter, I am not surprised by the 2016 financial statements receiving a qualified \naudit opinion.  As I understand it, EY replaced PwC as the Bank’s auditors in December 2016 \nand PrivatBank was nationalized in the same month.  Given the circumstances, expressing an \nunqualified opinion on the financial statements in a matter of months during such a tumultuous \nperiod for the Bank would have been an almost impossible task. \n138. With respect to the qualified opinion on the Fair Value of the Transferred Assets specifically, \nI cannot agree with the wording of EY’s audit letter.  There was sufficient and appropriate \naudit evidence for EY to review.  All of the Transferred Assets had been valued by third-party \nvaluers in 2016 and these valuation reports were even reviewed by EY.  While the professionals \nthat performed the review of the valuation reports disagreed with the valuations in certain \n \n68 PrivatBank 2016 Financial Statements, p. (ii).  (MB-A117)  \nD20/1/43\n \nPage 43 \n respects, the review was not performed to assess whether or not the valuations complied with \nIFRS 13.  Instead, I would describe the review as one of a valuer commenting on the work of  \nanother valuer.  I am more inclined to take the view that EY simply lacked sufficient time to \nreview all of the accounts and thus qualified its opinion where it was unable to get comfortable \nwith the underlying evidence. \n139. EY also expressed a qualified audit opinion with respect to the 2017 PrivatBank financial \nstatements.  Again, as one of many reasons for the qualified opinion, EY cited a lack of audit \nevidence for the Transferred Assets. \n“As at 31 December 2017 and 2016, the Group recognised \nrepossessed properties of UAH 6,716 million and UAH 7,303 \nmillion, respectively, within repossessed collateral.  We were unable \nto obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence in respect of the fair \nvalue of these repossessed properties as at 31 December 2017 and \n2016. As a result, we were unable to determine whether any \nadjustments were necessary to the carrying amounts of repossessed \ncollateral as at 31 December 2017 and 2016 and related losses and \nincome for the years then ended.   \nIn 2017, the Group recognised UAH 10,727 million of impairment \nlosses on repossessed collateral, UAH 717 million of losses from \nrevaluation of investment properties and UAH 257 million of losses \nfrom revaluation of premises. We were unable to obtain sufficient \nappropriate audit evidence about the period these impairment losses \nand revaluation losses relate to. As a result, we were unable to \ndetermine whether any adjustments were necessary to the \nconsolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive \nincome for 2017 and 2016 and the carrying value of repossessed \ncollateral stated at UAH 14,053 million, investment properties \nstated at UAH 1,095 million and premises stated at UAH 266 \nmillion as at 31 December 2016.”69 \n140. I have a different interpretation of the qualification in 2017 regarding the Transferred Assets \ncompared to that of Mr. Bezant.  While I agree EY continued to express doubts regarding the \n2016 Fair Values of Transferred Assets, I believe one contributing factor to these doubts was \nthat all of the valuers retained by PrivatBank to perform Fair Value calculations for the Petrol \nStations in 2017 disregarded or significantly adjusted the historical Petrol Station financial data \nfrom 2015 – 2016 H1 that had been previously provided.  It is unclear why the valuers in 2017 \n \n69 PrivatBank 2017 Financial Statements, p. (i).

No new or revised data from the Petrol Stations was \nprovided.  As such, it would appear the auditors questioned the 2016 Fair Value calculations \nfor the Petrol Stations because the 2017 Fair Value calculations were not performed with \nsimilar data as in 2016.  Thus, there is a clear inconsistency with respect to the Fair Value \ncalculations in 2016 and 2017.  I will discuss this in more detail in Section VI.   \n141. With respect to the Fair Value calculations for the Real Estate and OSFs, I cannot understand \nEY’s reasoning to describe the 2016 valuation reports as deficient audit evidence.  The \nevidence clearly existed and only needed to be evaluated.   I have not seen any valuation work \nthat would allow me to understand how and by what amount the Fair Values for Real Estate \nand the OSFs were remeasured in 2017.  As such, I cannot comment further.    \n142. EY expressed an unqualified opinion on the 2018 PrivatBank financial statements.  As noted \nearlier, PrivatBank restated the Fair Value accounting for the Transferred Assets in both 2016 \nand 2017 in the course of preparing the 2018 financial statements.  I address the restatement in \nSection VI.   \n The 2016 Restated Fair Value of Transferred Assets \n143. Mr. Bezant finds great significance in the restated 2016 financial statements with respect to \nthe Fair Value accounting for the Transferred Assets.  I comment on the restatement in the \nfollowing two subsections. \nA. General Comments on the Restatement \n144. Mr. Bezant describes the requirements under IFRS to restate prior period measurements to \ncorrect for material errors.  I agree that such a requirement exists under IFRS.  Where I differ \nwith Mr. Bezant is the triggering event for the restatement. \n145. As I explained in Section V, I am not surprised by the qualified audit opinion in 2016 given \nthat EY was retained as the new auditors in December 2016 and PrivatBank was nationalized \nin same month.  Stepping in as new auditors presented EY with a difficult situation, and EY \nwould be understandably cautious with their audit given the little time afforded to them to issue \nan audit letter. \nD20/1/45\n \nPage 45 \n 146. As I also explained in Section V, the valuers retained to perform the Fair Value \nremeasurements for the 2017 financial statements disregarded the previous data that had been \nprovided to the 2016 valuers or significantly adjusted the fuel sales volumes downward. \nInstead of relying upon the previous data provided, the valuations all relied upon notional \nestimates of the fuel sales volumes and made general estimates of future profits based upon \nthose volumes.  Thus, the Fair Value calculations made in 2017 were made on an entirely \ndifferent basis than the Fair Value calculations made in 2016.  As such, EY also qualified its \naudit opinion in 2017 because it was unable to determine what amount of profit or loss ought \nto be recorded in the 2017 financial statements. \n  “As at 31 December 2017 and 2016, the Group recognised \nrepossessed properties of UAH 6,716 million and UAH 7,303 \nmillion, respectively, within repossessed collateral.

As such, PrivatBank had to eliminate the obvious discrepancy that was created in 2017 when \nthe valuers ignored the 2015 and 2016 financial and operational data that Baker Tilly, UCE, \nand Veritas had relied upon for its 2016 Fair Value calculations.  PrivatBank chose to correct \nthis discrepancy by having new valuers (Volyn and Expert+) conduct new Fair Value \n \n70 PrivatBank 2017 Financial Statements, p. (i).  (MB-A118)  \nD20/1/46\n \nPage 46 \n calculations for 2016 in a similar fashion to the Fair Value calculations in 2017 – i.e., the \nvaluers disregarded the 2015/2016 financial and operational data provided to Baker Tilly, \nUCE, and Veritas.  Like the 2017 Fair Value calculations, Volyn and Expert+ relied upon \nnotional fuel sales volumes.  Thus, the method of correction was to use notional fuel sales \nvolumes in both 2016 and 2017 rather than confirm the actual financial and operational data \nfor 2015/2016.  PrivatBank could have collected and confirmed (or revised) the actual \n2015/2016 data provided to the 2016 valuers, but this option was not chosen.  Instead, \nPrivatBank opted to regularize 2016 and 2017 by having the valuers use notional fuel sales \nvolumes for every Petrol Station in both 2016 and 2017.  Notional fuel sales volumes continued \nto be utilized in 2018 to calculate the Fair Value of each Petrol Station.  Given that the Fair \nValue calculations were now all on a notional basis for all three years, EY was able to issue an \nunqualified audit opinion on the Petrol Stations. \n148. I am not able to comment on the method utilized in 2017 to calculate the Fair Values of the \nOSFs or the Real Estate because this information has not been provided to me.  However, in \n2018, the Fair Value calculations appear to be prepared on the basis that the OSFs were not \noperational and the restated 2016 Fair Value calculations appear to assume the same.  As such, \nit appears that the Fair Value calculations for the OSFs was regularized by assuming the OSFs \nhave not been operational since 2016.  However, I have seen no evidence from 2016 to indicate \nthe OSFs were not operational.  In fact, Mr. Bezant acknowledges he is uncertain if the OSFs \nwere operational in 2016 indicating the Bank never inspected the assets it took ownership over \nin 2016.71  \n149. Given the above, I disagree with Mr. Bezant that one should consider that the 2016 Fair \nValue calculations were in need of correction because they were erroneous. I believe the \nevidence indicates that either the 2016 or 2017 Fair Value calculations had to be modified to \nmake the calculations consistent.

Several of the 2016 Restated Fair Values Are Illogical  \n150. As I have explained, when a Fair Value (or even Market Value or FMV) calculation can only \nbe made at Level 3, i.e., relying predominantly on unobservable inputs, the range of potential \nFair Value outcomes can be significant as the unobservable inputs are based upon the \nprofessional views of management, or the outside valuer retained.  While sound valuation \npractice is always to choose reasonable inputs that would meet the willing buyer / willing seller \ntest, valuation practitioners will always disagree as to what inputs are reasonable.  Indeed, \nsmall differences in certain inputs, such as the discount rate in the Income Approach, can have \na large impact on the valuation result. \n151. As an example, I have identified two of the 2016 restated Fair Value calculations which I \nconsider to be unreasonably low. \n152. First, the original 2016 Fair Value calculation for the Dnipro Stadium was based upon the \nCost Approach.  The amount recorded by the Bank was UAH 1,517 million, or approximately \nUS$ 60 million.72  The NBU accepted a Fair Value of UAH 1,543 million, slightly higher than \nthe Fair Value recorded by the Bank.73  The Dnipro Stadium is 31,000 seat class 4 stadium and \nthe 5th largest stadium in Ukraine.  It was constructed by Hochtief, one of the largest \nconstruction companies in world based in Germany.  It opened in 2008 and public sources \nestimate the construction cost at Euro 65 million.74  The restated 2016 Fair Value for the \nstadium was UAH 16 million or USD 650,000.75  Apparently, according to the restated 2016 \nFair Value calculation, US$ 650,000 is the price a willing seller would accept in a transaction \nto sell the stadium.  This value is not consistent with the Fair Value standard in my view, but \nit was apparently accepted by EY as such when issuing an unqualified opinion regarding the \nBank’s 2018 financial statements. \n \n72 IK0008209_0001, p. 66. \n73 EY Report, p. 45. \n74 PB0150859_00001, p. 14. \n75 PB0271021_00001. \nD20/1/48\n \nPage 48 \n 153. Second, the 2016 restated Fair Value of the Airfield was UAH 4 million or just USD \n160,000.76  The NBU approved Fair Value was UAH 34 million.  The EY Report indicated the \nland alone was worth between UAH 40 and 180 million.77          \n My Approach to Determine the Fair Value of the Transferred Assets \n154. There were seven real estate properties that were transferred to the Bank in 2016: \ni. An office building in Kyiv (the “Kyiv Office”); \nii. An office building in Dnipro (the “Dnipro Office”); \niii. A luxury hotel near the Bukovel ski resort (“Hotel Zirka”); \niv. A combined hotel and office complex in Kyiv (“Hotel Mir”); \nv. A football stadium complex in Dnipro (the “Dnipro Stadium”); \nvi. An athletic training facility in Dnipro (the “Dnipro Training Center”); and \nvii. A collection of buildings in a non-operational airfield at Slobozhansky, Ukraine (the \n“Airfield”). \n155.

{"start": 101500, "text": " Office”); \niii. A luxury hotel near the Bukovel ski resort (“Hotel Zirka”); \niv. A combined hotel and office complex in Kyiv (“Hotel Mir”); \nv. A football stadium complex in Dnipro (the “Dnipro Stadium”); \nvi. An athletic training facility in Dnipro (the “Dnipro Training Center”); and \nvii. A collection of buildings in a non-operational airfield at Slobozhansky, Ukraine (the \n“Airfield”). \n155. Each of these seven properties were valued by at least two independent valuation firms that \nwere retained by the Bank in 2016 to assist in the assessment of the assets’ Fair Values.  Upon \ntransfer to the Bank in 2016, an initial Fair Value was recognized.  For two assets, the Dnipro \nOffice and Hotel Zirka, the initially recognized Fair Values were adjusted downward shortly \nafter the asset transfer, and the lower values were reported in the Bank’s financial statements \nfor the year ending 31 December 2016.  For the remaining assets, the initially recognized value \nremained unchanged in the Bank’s financial statements at year-end. \n156. Confirmation of the Fair Value of the majority of the Transferred Assets appears to have \nbeen performed under a tripartite agreement between the independent valuers, the Bank, and \nthe NBU. \n“The NBU validated the value of part of the repossessed property. \nValidation was performed through the receipt of reports of \nindependent valuers under tripartite agreements (between the valuer, \nthe Bank and the NBU). A total of 254 properties with a value at the \n \n76 PB0365513_00001 . \n77 EY Report, p. 45. \nD20/1/49\n \nPage 49 \n time the Bank took possession of them 31.9 billion UAH were \nvalidated. The value according to the results of the validation was \nUAH 31.5 billion.”78 \n157. Separately, EY was retained to review the Fair Value assessments recognized by the Bank \nand verified by the NBU.  In the Bank’s 2018 financial statements, the Fair Values recorded \nin the 2016 financial statements were restated for six of the seven transferred real estate assets.   \n158. Having reviewed the Real Estate valuation reports prepared in 2015/16, observed the \nadjustments recommended by the NBU, and reviewed the EY Report, I found it unnecessary \nto perform any de novo valuations for these assets.  The information and analysis was sufficient \nin my view to reach reasonable and reliable Fair Value conclusions.  Moreover, I did not find \nany new, contemporaneous information in the record that would assist to improve the analysis.  \nWhile my own de novo valuation of these assets might lead to higher or lower values, I am \nsatisfied with the valuation techniques used by the valuers in 2016 and did not identify any \nglaring errors in the analysis underlying the original Fair Values except those noted in the \nremainder of this section.  \n159. The Claimant has retained two valuation professionals, Mr. Mark Bezant of FTI Consulting \nand Mr. Paul Thomas of IRE USA INC. to provide expert evidence in the present dispute.  Mr. \nBezant has submitted a report in which he valued the two office buildings and two hotels, while \nMr. Thomas has submitted a report in which he valued the Dnipro Stadium, Dnipro Training \nCenter, and the Airfield.   \n160. In the following seven subsections, I discuss each of the real estate assets in greater detail, \ncomment on the valuations presented by Mr. Bezant and Mr. Thomas, and explain how I \narrived at my Fair Value conclusions. \nA.

The Kyiv Office is located in the central business district of Kyiv, the capital of, and largest \ncity in, Ukraine.80  The downtown location of the Kyiv Office provides easy access to public \ntransportation infrastructure.81  A 10 story building constructed in the early 1980s, the Kyiv \nOffice has a total area of 5,631.5 m2 and a total usable area of 4,750 m2.82  Of the total usable \narea, 4,338 m2 was available for lease.83  Inspections of the property undertaken in 2015 \nindicated that the property was in excellent condition with no visible damage.84 \n163. I have not been provided with historical operating or financial data for the Kyiv Office.  Thus, \nthe only information available to me is that which is included in four third-party valuation \nreports that were completed between 2015 and 2019.  Two reports were issued prior to 31 \nDecember 2016, the date on which the Fair Values of the Transferred Assets were recorded in \nthe Bank’s financial statements. \n164. First, Universal Commodities Exchange (“UCE”) issued a report in 2015 (“UCE Kyiv Office \nReport”), using a valuation date of 18 June 2015.85  UCE assessed the Kyiv Office using both \nan income approach and a market approach, and reached value conclusions of UAH 310.8 \nmillion and UAH 321.7 million, respectively.  Based on its assessment of the reliability of the \ndata used in each methodology, UCE indicated a preference for the market approach and issued \na final value opinion of UAH 321.7 million, excluding VAT.86 \n165. Second, Expandia LLC, a member of the CBRE affiliate network (“CBRE”), issued a report \non 13 October 2016 (“CBRE Kyiv Office Report”) that valued the Kyiv Office as of 1 July \n2016.87  CBRE also used both the income and the market approaches to value the Kyiv Office.  \nUnder the income approach, CBRE arrived at a value conclusion of UAH 93.0 million, \nexcluding VAT.88  Under the market approach, CBRE arrived at a Fair Value conclusion of \n \n80 IK0007551_0001, p. 11. \n81 PB0271100_00001, p. 13. \n82 PB0271100_00001, p. 13. \n83 Partial translations of disclosed documents, p. 431.

Their resulting Fair Value \nconclusion was UAH 207.0 million, excluding VAT.90 \n166. The Fair Value of the Kyiv Office was originally assessed at UAH 321.7 million on the \nBank’s financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2016, based on the conclusion \nreached in the UCE Kyiv Office Report.91  I do not know why the UCE Kyiv Office Report, \nrather than the CBRE Kyiv Office Report, was selected as the basis for the original Fair Value \nassessment of the Kyiv Office.  The value pleaded by the First Defendant in the present \nproceedings is also UAH 321.7 million.   \n167. Shortly after the issuance of the CBRE Kyiv Office Report, EY authored a report dated 22 \nNovember 2016 ( the “EY Report”) in which it performed a desk review and provided \ncomments on the initially recognized Fair Values for the Transferred Assets.92  According to \nEY, the NBU had determined that the “verified” value of the Kyiv "}

Based on the value conclusion of UAH 207 million and the valuation date of 1 July 2016, it \nappears that the second of the two reports reviewed by EY was the CBRE Kyiv Office Report.  It does not appear \nthat EY reviewed the UCE Kyiv Office Report. \n95 EY Report, p. 207. \nD20/1/52\n \nPage 52 \n 168. Two further reports assessing the value of the Kyiv Office were produced after the initial \nrecognition of the Transferred Assets on the Bank’s balance sheet at the end of 2016.  \n169. First, Expert+ prepared a report in January 2019 (“Expert+ Kyiv Office Report”) that valued \nthe Kyiv Office as of 1 October 2016.96  Expert+ implemented only the Market Approach and \nreached a Fair Value conclusion for the Kyiv Office of UAH 193.7 million, excluding VAT.97 \n170. Second, Colliers prepared a report in November 2017 (“Colliers Kyiv Office Report”), in \nwhich it valued the Kyiv Office as of 25 November 2017.98  Colliers used both the Income and \nthe Market Approaches to value the Kyiv Office.  Under the Income Approach, Colliers arrived \nat a Fair Value conclusion of UAH 117.3 million, excluding VAT.99  Under the Market \nApproach, Colliers arrived at a Fair Value conclusion of UAH 186.3 million, excluding \nVAT.100  Colliers concluded that the Market Approach was the most appropriate methodology, \ngiven the likely motivations of market participants at the time.  Therefore, Colliers reached a \nfinal Fair Value conclusion of UAH 186.3 million.101  \n171. The Bank’s 2018 financial statements included a restatement of the Fair Value of the \nTransferred Assets as of 31 December 2016.  The restated Fair Value of the Kyiv Office was \nUAH 193.7 million, 40 percent lower than the original Fair Value assessment, based on the \nvalue analysis set out in Expert+ Kyiv Office Report.102  I do not know why the Expert+ Kyiv \nOffice Report, rather than the Colliers Kyiv Office Report, was selected as the basis for the \nrestated Fair Value of the Kyiv Office.   \n172. Mr. Bezant has introduced his own valuation of the Kyiv Office, using a valuation date of 1 \nJuly 2016.103  Without direct access to operational and financial data for the Kyiv Office, Mr. \nBezant’s analysis draws on the data included in the aforementioned valuation reports alongside \nadditional publicly available information.104  Mr. Bezant used both the Market Approach and \nthe Income Approach to value the Kyiv Office. \n \n96 PB0271100_00001, p. 4. \n97 PB0271100_00001, p. 37. \n98 PB0240767_00001; Partial translations of disclosed documents, pp. 42"}

In order to value to the Kyiv Office under the Market Approach, Mr. Bezant collected unit \nprices for office space located in central Kyiv as of 2016.  Mr. Bezant includes reference data \nfrom the CBRE Kyiv Office Report, the Expert+ Kyiv Office Report, and the Colliers Kyiv \nOffice Report.  However, Mr. Bezant excluded the UCE Kyiv Office Report from his analysis \ndue to three alleged shortcomings in UCE’s analysis.105 In addition, Mr. Bezant relies upon \nfigures published by two Ukrainian real estate consulting firms, Uvecon and SV \nDevelopment.106  Mr. Bezant observed a range of sales prices for office space in downtown \nKyiv between UAH 33,090/m2 and UAH 41,814/m2.107  After applying these unit prices to the \nKyiv Office’s total floor area of 5,632 m2, Mr. Bezant reached a value conclusion under the \nMarket Approach ranging between UAH 186.3 million and UAH 235.5 million, excluding \nVAT.108 \n174. In order to value the Kyiv Office under the Income Approach, Mr. Bezant relied on three of \nthe four valuation reports prepared for the Kyiv Office, again excluding the UCE Kyiv Office \nReport.109  In addition, Mr. Bezant included additional market data prepared by CBRE and \nDTZ, two international real estate companies, alongside existing lease agreements for the Kyiv \nOffice.110  Mr. Bezant calculated average monthly rents for office space in downtown Kyiv to \nrange from UAH 307/m2 to 497/m2.111  After incorporating assumptions regarding rent growth, \nother income and expenses, and a discount rate, Mr. Bezant reached a value conclusion under \nthe Income Approach ranging between UAH 104.2 million and UAH 202.0 million, excluding \nVAT.112 \n175. Finally, Mr. Bezant selected his final value conclusion for the Kyiv Office by identifying the \noverlap between the value ranges established using the Market and Income Approaches, UAH \n \n105 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, ¶ 6.22. The three shortcomings cited by Mr. Bezant include: 1) the unadjusted \nasking prices of the comparables selected by UCE appear to be outliers, 2) UCE did not adjust the unit price to \naccount for differences in property size, and 3) UCE made an upward adjustment related to the technical condition \nof the property that is not supported by the assessments of the other valuation firms. \n106 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, ¶ 6.22. \n107 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, ¶ 6.25. \n108 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, ¶ 6.25. \n109 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, ¶ 6.29. In addition to the alleged flaws noted in his critique of the UCE Kyiv \nOffice Report’s market approach, Mr. Bezant also indicates that the UCE Kyiv Office Report incorrectly uses a \nmonthly rent that is inclusive of VAT as if it were exclusive of VAT. \n110 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, ¶ 6.30. \n111 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, ¶ 6.31. \n112 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, ¶ 6.34. \nD20/1/54\n \nPage 54 \n 186.3 million to UAH 202.0 million, and locating the midpoint.

Figure 9 below summarizes the various value conclusions reached for the Kyiv Office. \nFigure 9 – Valuations of the Kyiv Office \n \n177. Figure 9 above shows that the value conclusions range from a high of UAH 322 million (the \nUCE Kyiv Office Report) to a low of UAH 104.2 million (the low end of Mr. Bezant’s range \nof conclusions under the Income Approach).  Furthermore, Figure1 demonstrates a \nconcentration of value estimates between approximately UAH 180 million and UAH 260 \nmillion.  Given the independent and contemporaneous valuation analyses conducted with \nrespect to the Kyiv Office, and the aforementioned concentration of results within a reasonably \nfocused range, it is my view that it is not necessary to construct a de novo valuation of this \nproperty.  In my view, the most relevant figure for the purposes of establishing the Fair Value \nof the Kyiv Office as of 31 December 2016, particularly given the fact that the Fair Value \ncalculation can only be performed at Level 3, is the value approved by the NBU of UAH 245 \nmillion.114   \n \n113 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, ¶ 6.35. \n114 EY Report, p. 43. 050100150200250300350UAH Millions2015/2016 \nValuation Reports2017/2019 \nValuation ReportsValues from EY Report Bezant Report\nD20/1/55\n \nPage 55 \n 178. The NBU verified the value of the Kyiv Office, via its role in a tripartite agreement between \nthe Bank, the NBU, and the valuation firms carrying out their independent valuation \nanalysis.115  While the Fair Value of the Kyiv Office, as verified by the NBU, is substantially \nlower than the original Fair Value recorded on the Bank’s balance sheet in December 2016, \nthe NBU-verified value is close to the upper bound of Fair Value estimates put forth in the EY \nReport and close to the upper bound of Mr. Bezant’s valuation under the Market Approach.  \nThe Market Approach was identified by UCE, Colliers, and CBRE as the preferred valuation \ntechnique to value the Kyiv Office, as well as the only technique implemented by Expert+.   \n179. Two valuations of the same asset may differ, even sometimes substantially, based on the \nunobservable inputs used by each valuation practitioner when the valuation can only meet the \nLevel 3 classification.  This does not necessarily mean that one of the valuations correct and \nthe other incorrect as there is a range of outcomes that would be deemed correct at Level 3.  \nAs such, the fact that first EY and now Mr. Bezant, after exercising their own professional \njudgment over a range of inputs and assumptions, arrived at lower value conclusions for the \nKyiv Office does not mean that the value verified by the NBU was incorrect.  For example, \nthe observations made by EY are not stated to relate to clear errors in the two valuation reports \nit reviewed.  Instead, EY’s adjustments relate to its own professional opinions regarding the \nvaluers’ methodologies and inputs, such as the discount rate, the selection of comparable \nproperties, and adjustment factors to be applied to those comparable properties.116   \n180. Therefore, although the NBU-verified value is approximately 4 percent higher than the upper \nbound of EY and Mr. Bezant’s range of value conclusions, I consider EY and Mr. Bezant’s \nanalysis to generally confirm that the NBU verified Fair Value conclusions to be reasonable.  \nMy assessment of the Fair Value of the Kyiv Office as of 31 December 2016 is UAH 245 \nmillion, consistent with the Fair Value verified by the NBU.  \n \n115 EY Report, p. 13. \n116 EY Report, pp. 205-206. \nD20/1/56\n \nPage 56 \n B.

Dnipro Office \n181. The Dnipro Office is located at 32 Naberezhna Peremohy Street, Dnipro.117  In this \nsubsection, I first provide a brief overview of the key characteristics of this asset.  Second, I \ndiscuss the various valuation reports prepared for the Dnipro Office, and how these reports \nhave been used to assess its Fair Value. Third, I comment on the valuation of the Dnipro Office \nprepared by Mr. Bezant.  Finally, I set out my own conclusion as to the most reasonable \napproach to assessing the Fair Value of the Dnipro Office as of 31 December 2016. \n182. The Dnipro Office is located in Dnipro, one of the largest cities in Ukraine and the capital of \nthe Dnipropetrovsk region.118  Originally constructed in 1986 for use as an engineering and \nlaboratory building, the Dnipro Office was later rebuilt as an office center.119  The Dnipro \nOffice is comprised of two buildings with a combined total area of 16,927.3 m2.120  The vast \nmajority of this total area is located in the larger of the two buildings, which had a total area \nof 15,234.9 m2.121 An inspections of the property undertaken in 2015 indicated that the property \nwas in excellent condition.122 \n183. I have not been provided with historical operating or financial data for the Dnipro Office.  \nThus, the only information available to me is that which is included in three third-party \nvaluation reports that were completed between 2015 and 2019.  Two reports were issued prior \nto 31 December 2016, the date on which the Fair Values of the Transferred Assets were \nrecorded in the Bank’s 2016 financial statements. \n184. First, UCE issued a report in 2015 (“UCE Dnipro Office Report”), using a valuation date of \n18 June 2015.123  UCE considered the Fair Value of the Dnipro Office using both the Income \nApproach and Market Approaches and reached value conclusions of UAH 418.8 million and \nUAH 453.0 million, respectively.124  Based on its assessment of the reliability of the data used \n \n117 Schedule of Transferred Assets, Schedule 1 to D1 RFI, 17 April 2020. \n118 PB0220599_00001, p. 18. \n119 PB0220599_00001, p. 25. \n120 PB0220599_00001, p. 22. \n121 PB0220599_00001, p. 22. \n122 PB0220599_00001, p. 28. \n123 IK0007552_0001. \n124 IK0007552_0001, pp. 31, 34. \nD20/1/57\n \nPage 57 \n in each technique, UCE indicated a preference for the Market Approach and issued a final Fair \nValue opinion of UAH 453.0 million, excluding VAT.125 \n185. Second, Kreston GCG (“Kreston”), issued a valuation report on 4 August 2016 (“Kreston \nDnipro Office Report”) that valued the Dnipro Office as of 1 July 2016.126  Kreston also used \nboth the Income and the Market Approaches to value the Dnipro Office.  Under the Income \nApproach, Kreston arrived at a Fair Value conclusion of UAH 270.3 million, excluding \nVAT.127  Under the Market Approach, Kreston arrived at a Fair Value conclusion of UAH \n212.1 million, excluding VAT.128  Based on its assessment of the reliability of the data used in \neach methodology, Kreston indicated a preference for the Market Approach and issued a final \nFair Value opinion of UAH 212.1 million, excluding VAT.129 \n186. The Fair Value of the Dnipro Office was originally calculated to be UAH 452.0 million upon \ntransfer to the Bank, based on the conclusion reached in the UCE Dnipro Office Report.130  I \ndo not know why the UCE Dnipro Office Report, rather than the Kreston Dnipro Office Report, \nwas selected as the basis for the original Fair Value assessment of the Dnipro Office.

The value pleaded by the First Defendant in the present \nproceedings is also UAH 212.1 million.131   \n187. A further analysis of the Fair Value of the Dnipro Office was contained in the EY Report.132  \nAccording to EY, the NBU had determined that the “verified” value of the Dnipro Office was \nUAH 212 million, consistent with the Fair Value recognized by the Bank following the \nSeptember 2016 adjustment.133  EY performed its own desktop review of two unnamed \nvaluation reports, which included value conclusions of UAH 377 million and UAH 212 \nmillion.134  EY determined that, although the general approach adopted by the valuers was \n \n125 IK0007552_0001, p. 35. \n126 PB0220599_00001, p. 4. \n127 PB0220599_00001, p. 32. \n128 PB0220599_00001, p. 36. \n129 IK0007552_0001, p. 35. \n130 EY Report, p. 43. \n131 Schedule of Transferred Assets, Schedule 1 to D1 RFI, 17 April 2020. \n132 EY Report, p. 42. \n133 EY Report, p. 43. \n134 EY Report, p. 198.  Based on the value conclusion of UAH 207 million and the valuation date of 1 July 2016, it \nappears that the second of the two reports reviewed by EY was the Kreston Dnipro Office Report.  It does not appear \nthat EY reviewed the UCE Dnipro Office Report. \nD20/1/58\n \nPage 58 \n appropriate, some adjustments were recommended.  EY concluded in its desk review that the \npotential Fair Value range for the Dnipro Office was between UAH 181 million and UAH 194 \nmillion, a reduction of 8 to 15 percent from the adjusted Fair Value of 212.1 million that had \nbeen recognized by the Bank.135  The EY Report does not describe in any detail how any \nchanges to the two valuation reports were implemented or how precisely its own range of value \nconclusions was reached. \n188. One additional report assessing the value of the Dnipro Office was produced after the initial \nrecognition of the Transferred Assets on the Bank’s balance sheet at the end of 2016.  Expert+ \nprepared a report in January 2019 (“Expert+ Dnipro Office Report”) that valued the Dnipro \nOffice as of 1 October 2016.136  Expert+ implemented the Market Approach and the Income \nApproach and reached a value conclusion for the Dnipro Office of UAH 193.4 million and \n183.4 million, excluding VAT.137  Expert+ expressed a preference for the Income Approach, \nand therefore indicated a value conclusion for the Dnipro Office of UAH 183.4 million.  While \nthe Expert+ Dnipro Office Report includes a lower value estimate than the UAH 212.1 million \nFair Value at which the Dnipro Office was assessed at year-end 2016, upon the restatement of \nthe Transferred Asset values as of 31 December 2016 in the Bank’s 2018 financial statements, \nno change was made to the Fair Value of the Dnipro Office.  \n189.

In order to value the Dnipro Office under the Income Approach, Mr. Bezant relied on the \nmonthly rent data set out in the Expert+ Dnipro Office Report, which ranged from UAH \n110/m2 to UAH 180/m2 in 2017.146  After incorporating assumptions regarding operating \nexpenses, income taxes, and capitalization rate, Mr. Bezant reached a value conclusion under \nthe Income Approach ranging between UAH 113.1 million and UAH 202.6 million, excluding \nVAT.147 \n192. Finally, Mr. Bezant selected his final value conclusion for the Dnipro Office by identifying \nthe overlap between the value ranges established using the Market and Income Approaches, \nUAH 147.4 million to UAH 202.6 million, and locating the midpoint.  Thus Mr. Bezant’s final \nvalue conclusion for the Dnipro Office is UAH 175.0 million.148 \n193.

I have not been provided with historical operating or financial data for Hotel Zirka, apart \nfrom the information included in five third-party valuation reports that were completed \nbetween 2015 and 2019.  Three reports were issued prior to 31 December 2016, the date on \nwhich the Fair Values of the Transferred Assets were recorded in Claimant’s financial \nstatements. \n200. First, UCE issued a report in December 2015 (“UCE 2015 Zirka Report”), using a valuation \ndate of 14 December 2015.160  UCE assessed Hotel Zirka using both an Income Approach and \na Market Approach, and reached value conclusions of UAH 2,409 million and UAH 3,570 \nmillion, respectively.  Based on its assessment of the appropriateness of each methodology, \nUCE indicated a preference for the Market Approach and issued a final Fair Value opinion of \nUAH 3,570 million, excluding VAT.161 \n201. UCE produced a second valuation of Hotel Zirka in a report dated 10 May 2016 (“UCE 2016 \nZirka Report”).162  UCE’s updated value conclusion under the Market Approach remained at \nUAH 3,570, while its valuation under the Income Approach increased to UAH 3,072 \nmillion.163 \n202. Third, Veritas valued Hotel Zirka as of 30 June 2016 in a report dated 17 August 2016 \n(“Veritas Zirka Report”).164 Veritas valued the main hotel building using both an Income \nApproach and a Market Approach and reached value conclusions of UAH 1,201 million and \nUAH 1,490 million, respectively.165  Veritas indicates a preference for using the Income \nApproach to assess the main hotel building, and thus values this component of the Zirka Hotel \nat UAH 1,201 million.  Veritas also used the Market Approach to value the improvements on \nthe secondary land plot at UAH 355 million and value of the two underlying land plots \nthemselves at UAH 60.7 million.166  When combined with the assessment of the main hotel \nbuilding of UAH 1,201 million, Veritas reached a final value conclusion of UAH 1,617 million \nfor Hotel Zirka, as shown in Table 4 below. \n \n160 IK0008213_0001. \n161 IK0008213_0001, p. 52. \n162 PB0363153_00001. \n163 PB0363153_00001, p. 62. \n164 PB0163246_00001, p. 4. \n165 PB0163246_00001, p. 81. \n166 PB0163246_00001, p. 81. \nD20/1/63\n \nPage 63 \n Table 4 – Value Conclusions from the Veritas Zirka Report \n \n203.

In this report, AE implemented only the Income \nApproach and reached a value conclusion for Hotel Zirka of UAH 874 million, excluding \nVAT.175  \n208. The Bank’s 2018 financial statements included a restatement of the Fair Value of the \nTransferred Assets as of 31 December 2016.

Mr. Bezant has conducted his own valuation of Hotel Zirka, using a valuation date of 1 July \n2016.  Mr. Bezant values Hotel Zirka using the Income Approach, while the Market Approach \nis used only as a reasonableness check.

Mr. Bezant then provides a reasonableness check using three valuation multiples: 1) \nEV/EBITDA, 2) EV/Revenue, and 3) EV/Room.  After collecting a set of companies and \ntransactions he deems comparable to Hotel Zirka, Mr. Bezant calculates each of these three \nmultiples for each comparable.  The results of this exercise are then compared to the multiples \nimplied by the output of Mr. Bezant’s DCF model.

Figure 11 also demonstrates that the UCE Zirka Reports \nare significant outliers, while the remaining valuations are concentrated between \napproximately UAH 900 million and UAH 1,600 million.   \n214. In my discussion of the Kyiv Office in subsection A and the Dnipro Office in subsection B, \nI observed that the differences between the Fair Values recognized by the Bank as of 31 \nDecember 2016 and other subsequent valuations were limited and largely due to differences in \nprofessional opinion regarding methodology and input assumptions between two valuers.  In \nthe case of Hotel Zirka, however, there are clear errors present in the valuation analysis on \nwhich the 31 December 2016 Fair Value assessment was based, namely the Veritas Zirka \nReport.  For example, Veritas did not deduct corporate income tax when projecting Hotel \nZirka’s cash flows.  Veritas uses the capital asset pricing model (“CAPM”) to calculate the \ncost of equity.181 Since the data underpinning the CAPM is post-tax, Veritas incorrectly \nmatched a post-tax discount rate with pre-tax cash flows.  In addition, Veritas used a US dollar \ndenominated discount rate to discount local currency (UAH) denominated cash flows. \n215. Therefore, despite the fact that, according to the EY Report, the NBU verified a value of \nUAH 1,693 for Hotel Zirka, in my view it is appropriate to make an adjustment to the UAH \n1,617 Fair Value recognized by the Bank as of 31 December 2016.

I \nadopt Mr. Bezant’s valuation conclusion of UAH 1,072 million as my estimate of the Fair \nValue of the main hotel operation at Hotel Zirka as of 31 December 2016. \n216. However, I disagree with EY’s view that no separate value should be attributed to the \nauxiliary facilities used as staff accommodations and am of the opinion that the value of these \nreal estate assets should be added to Mr. Bezant’s valuation of Hotel Zirka.  These facilities \neffectively serve as apartments for hotel employees and I presume that employees pay rent, \neither through explicit withholdings from their compensation or through lower salaries.  As \nfull financial statements for Hotel Zirka were not made available to me, I am unable to \ndetermine how any such arrangements were made.   Nevertheless, in my view, the staff \naccommodation facility should be properly considered as an income generating asset that has \nvalue apart from the main hotel operation.  I do not know whether the view taken by Veritas, \n \n181 PB0163246_00001, p. 75. \nD20/1/67\n \nPage 67 \n that the staff accommodations would be converted to guest rooms, is economically feasible or \nwhat resulting costs might be incurred.  Mr. Bezant also indicates that he is unable to determine \nthe feasibility of converting the staff accommodation facility.182 Due to this uncertainty, I \nreduce the value calculated by Veritas of the auxiliary facility by 30 percent, from UAH 355 \nmillion to UAH 249 million.  This 30 percent haircut is in line with the reduction in value \nbetween the Veritas Zirka Report’s value conclusion for the main hotel using the same Market \nApproach used to value the staff accommodation facility (UAH 1,490) and Mr. Bezant’s \nvaluation (UAH 1,072 million).   \n217. Therefore, my assessment of the Fair Value of Hotel Zirka as of 31 December 2016 is UAH \n1,321 million, equal to the sum of Mr. Bezant’s valuation of Hotel Zirka under the Income \nApproach plus the adjusted value of the auxiliary buildings. \nD.

I have not been provided with historical operating or financial data for Hotel Mir, apart from \nthe information included in the five third-party valuation reports that were completed between \n2015 and 2019.  Three reports were issued prior to 31 December 2016, the date on which the \nFair Values of the Transferred Assets were recorded in Claimant’s financial statements. \n221. The first pre-2017 valuation report was prepared by Colliers in March 2015 (“Colliers Mir \nReport”), using a valuation date of 27 February 2015.189  Colliers valued the two main \nbuildings of Hotel Mir using both the Income Approach and the Market Approach.  For the \n14-story hotel and office building, Colliers reached value conclusions of UAH 182.8 million \nunder the Income Approach and UAH 181.1 million under the Market Approach.190  For the \n5-story building that housed commercial and office space, Colliers reached value conclusions \nof UAH 76.4 million under the Income Approach and UAH 175.4 million under the Market \nApproach.  Finally, Colliers valued the two auxiliary buildings at a total of UAH 1.0 million.191  \nColliers averaged its results under each approach for each of the two main buildings, added the \nvalue of the auxiliary buildings, and reached a final value conclusion for the Mir Hotel of UAH \n258.8 million, excluding VAT.192 \n222. The second pre-2017 valuation report was prepared by UCE in a report dated 31 July 2015 \n(“UCE Mir Report”) using a valuation date of 30 July 2015.193  UCE also valued Hotel Mir \nusing both the Income and Market Approaches.  UCE reached value conclusions of UAH 396 \nmillion under the Income Approach and UAH 449 million under the Market Approach.  UCE \nindicated a preference for the Market Approach, and thus it’s final value conclusion for the \nMir Hotel was UAH 449 million.194 \n \n188 PB0163549_00001, p. 14. \n189 PB0365821_00001, p. 3. \n190 PB0365821_00001, p. 63.

CBRE valued Hotel Mir as of \n1 July 2016 in a report dated 20 September 2016 (“CBRE 2016 Mir Report”).195 CBRE valued \nthe main hotel building using the Income and Market Approaches.  CBRE reached value \nconclusions of UAH 311.2 million under the Market Approach and UAH 106.1 million under \nthe Income Approach.  CBRE averaged its results, assigning an 80 percent weight to the \nMarket Approach and a 20 percent weight to the Income Approach, resulting in a final value \nconclusion of 270.2 million.196 \n224. The Fair Value of Hotel Mir was originally assessed at UAH 449 million upon its transfer to \nthe Bank, based upon the value conclusion reached in the UCE Mir Report. The value pleaded \nby the First Defendant in the present proceedings is also UAH 449 million.197   \n225.

First, Expert+ prepared a report in January 2019 (“Expert+ Mir Report”) that valued Hotel \nMir as of 1 October 2016.202  Expert+ reached a value conclusion for Hotel Mir of UAH 226 \nmillion, excluding VAT, using the Income Approach.203 \n229. Second, CBRE issued an additional report in December 2017 (“CBRE 2017 Mir Report”) in \nwhich it valued Hotel Mir as of 1 November 2017.204 In this report, CBRE relied entirely upon \nthe Market Approach to reach a value conclusion for Hotel Mir of UAH 271 million, excluding \nVAT.205  \n230. The Bank’s 2018 financial statements also included a retrospective restatement of the Fair \nValue of the Transferred Assets as of 31 December 2016.  The restated value of Hotel Mir was \nUAH 226 million, 50 percent lower than the Fair Value recorded at year-end 2016, based on \nthe value conclusion set out in Expert+ Mir Report as of 1 October 2016.206 \n231. Mr. Bezant has provided his own valuation of Hotel Mir, using a valuation date of 1 July \n2016.  Mr. Bezant values the office portion and hotel portion of Hotel Mir separately.  To value \nthe office portion, Mr. Bezant adopts the assumption regarding the division of the total area \nfound in the 2017 CBRE Mir Report.207  He then calculates an average unit price per square \nmeter for similarly located office buildings, using data published by the real estate \nconsultancies Uvecon and SV Development.208  After applying the average adjusted unit price \nto the floor area dedicated to as office space, Mr. Bezant concludes that the value of the office \nportion of Hotel Mir is UAH 219.9 million.209  \n232. To value the hotel portion of Hotel Mir, Mr. Bezant applies the same three valuation \nmultiples he used in his reasonableness check for Hotel Zirka: EV/EBITDA, EV/Revenue, and \nEV/Room.210  Mr. Bezant uses historical operating and financial data provided in the third-\nparty valuation reports discussed above to project the normalized revenues and EBITDA for \n \n202 PB0365521_00001. \n203 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, Appendix 21, Table A21-7. \n204 PB0163252_00001. \n205 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, Appendix 21, Table A21-8. \n206 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, ¶ 8.10. \n207 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, Table 8.5. \n208 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, Table 8.6. \n209 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, ¶ 8.28. \n210 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, ¶ 8.29. \nD20/1/71\n \nPage 71 \n the hotel operation, and assumes that the hotel has 138 rooms, consistent with the CBRE 2016 \nand 2017 Mir Reports as well as Hotel Mir’s own website.211 \n233.

After collecting a set of companies and transactions he deems comparable to Hotel Mir, Mr. \nBezant calculates each of these three multiples for each comparable.  He then takes the median \nvalue and applies this multiple to the corresponding metric for Hotel Mir.  Mr. Bezant identifies \nthe valuation for Hotel Mir based on the EV/Room multiple as an outlier and excludes it from \nhis analysis.  Mr. Bezant indicates a preference for the median multiples based on his set of \ncomparable companies over the multiples based on a single comparable transaction and a \npreference for EV/EBITDA multiples over EV/Revenue multiples, and thus he reaches a value \nconclusion for the hotel operations of Hotel Mir of UAH 32.4 million.212  Adding this amount \nto the value of the office space (UAH 219.9 million), Mr. Bezant reaches a final value \nconclusion for Hotel Mir of UAH 252.3 million.213 \n234. Figure 12 below summarizes the various value conclusions reached for Hotel Mir. \nFigure 12 – Valuations of Hotel Mir \n \n \n211 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, ¶¶ 8.49-8.51, Table 8-7. \n212 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, ¶ 8.57, Table 8-11. \n213 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, ¶ 8.58. 050100150200250300350400450500\nColliers\nReportUCE Report CBRE 2016\nReportExpert+\nReportCBRE 2017\nReportNBU\nApproved\n(2015)BezantUAH Millions2015/2016 Valuation Reports 2017/2019 Valuation \nReportsValues \nfrom EY \nReportBezant \nReport\nD20/1/72\n \nPage 72 \n 235. Figure 12 shows that the value conclusions range from a high of UAH 449 million (the UCE \nMir Report) to a low of UAH 226 million (the Expert+ Mir Report).  Figure 12 also \ndemonstrates that the UCE Mir Report is a significant outlier, while the remaining valuations \nare concentrated between approximately UAH 225 million and UAH 275 million.   \n236. Given the amount of independent and contemporaneous valuation analysis conducted with \nrespect to Hotel Mir, and the aforementioned concentration of results within a reasonably \nfocused range (aside from the UCE Mir Report), in my view it is not necessary to construct a \nde novo valuation analysis of this property to arrive at my own view of Fair Value.  In my \nview, the most relevant figure, for the purposes of establishing the Fair Value of Hotel Mir as \nof 31 December 2016, is the value approved by the NBU of UAH 259 million in 2015.214  \nAlthough the NBU had not issued an updated verification under the tripartite agreement \nbetween the Bank, the NBU, and the independent valuation firms, I see no reason why the \nNBU would have changed its view on the previously approved figure, especially given that the \nonly valuation report prepared in the intervening period, the CBRE 2016 Mir Report, \nconcluded a value higher than the one that had been previously approved.  The NBU-approved \nvalue lies near the center of the range of other valuations of Hotel Mir and is less than 3 percent \nhigher than Mr. Bezant’s value conclusion.  Thus, while Mr. Bezant uses a different \nmethodology and different assumptions than the Collier 2015 Mir Report, which was the basis \nfor the value approved by the NBU in 2015, I consider that Mr. Bezant’s analysis confirms that \nthe NBU approved value was reasonable.  Accordingly, my assessment of the Fair Value of \nHotel Mir as of 31 December 2016 is UAH 258.8 million, consistent with the Fair Value \npreviously approved by the NBU.  \n \n214 EY Report, p. 43. \nD20/1/73\n \nPage 73 \n E.

Second, I discuss \nthe various valuation reports prepared for the Dnipro Stadium, and how these reports have been \nused to assess its Fair Value. Third, I comment on the valuation of the Dnipro Stadium prepared \nby Mr. Thomas.  Finally, I set out my own conclusion as to the most reasonable approach to \nassessing the Fair Value of the Dnipro Stadium as of 31 December 2016. \n238. The Dnipro Stadium is located in the city of Dnipro, one of the largest cities in Ukraine and \nthe capital of the Dnipropetrovsk region.216 The Dnipro Stadium is the centerpiece of a \ncomplex that includes facilities for football, other sports, and public and commercial events.217  \nThe Dnipro Stadium was built between 2005 and 2008 at a cost of EUR 65 million and contains \nseating for over 31,000 attendees.218  Designed to comply with all UEFA and FIFA \nrequirements, the Dnipro Stadium is capable of hosting major international football \ncompetitions in addition to domestic league games.219  The Dnipro Stadium is outfitted with \n“state of the art” equipment, including heating and watering systems for the football field, \nvideo boards, lighting, and sound system.220 \n239. I have not been provided with historical operating or financial data for the Dnipro Stadium.  \nThus, the only information available to me is that which is included in three third-party \nvaluation reports that were completed between 2015 and 2019.  Two reports were issued prior \nto 31 December 2016, the date on which the Fair Values of the Transferred Assets were \nrecorded in Claimant’s financial statements. \n240. First, UCE issued a report in 2015 (“UCE Stadium Report”), using a valuation date of 14 \nDecember 2015.221  UCE valued the Dnipro Stadium using a combination of the Cost Approach \nand the Market Approach.222  Certain elements of the stadium complex, generally structural or \n \n215 Schedule of Transferred Assets, Schedule 1 to D1 RFI, 17 April 2020. \n216 PB0150859_00001, p. 14. \n217 PB0150859_00001, p. 14. \n218 PB0150859_00001, p. 14. \n219 PB0150859_00001, p. 16. \n220 PB0150859_00001, p. 17. \n221 IK0008209_0001, p. 2. \n222 IK0008209_0001, pp. 44-45. \nD20/1/74\n \nPage 74 \n exterior elements, as well as the underlying land, were valued using the Cost Approach.223  The \ninterior space of buildings located in the Stadium complex were valued using the Market \nApproach.224 UCE added the results of these analyses to reach a value conclusion of UAH \n1,517 million.225 \n241. Second, Veritas issued a report on 18 August 2016 (“Veritas Stadium Report”) that valued \nthe Dnipro Stadium as of 30 June 2016.226  Veritas used only the Cost Approach to value the \nDnipro Stadium and reached a value conclusion of UAH 1,544 million.227   \n242. The Fair Value of the Stadium was originally assessed at UAH 1,517 million on the Bank’s \nfinancial statements for the year ending 31 December 2016, based on the conclusion reached \nin the UCE Stadium Report.228  I do not know why the UCE Stadium Report, rather than the \nVeritas Stadium Report, was selected as the basis for the year-end 2016 Fair Value assessment \nof the Dnipro Stadium.

One additional report assessing the value of the Dnipro Stadium was produced after the initial \nrecognition of the Transferred Assets on the Bank’s balance sheet at the end of 2016.  Sineks \nLLC prepared a report in January 2019 (“Sineks Stadium Report”) that valued the Dnipro \nStadium as of 31 December 2016.  Using only the Income Approach, Sineks valued the Dnipro \nStadium at just UAH 16.2 million, a 99 percent reduction from the originally recognized Fair \nValue of UAH 1,517 million. \n \n223 IK0008209_0001, pp. 48-54. \n224 IK0008209_0001, pp. 57-58. \n225 IK0008209_0001, p. 66. \n226 PB0150859_00001, p. 1. \n227 PB0150859_00001, p. 83. \n228 Schedule of Transferred Assets, Schedule 1 to D1 RFI, 17 April 2020. \n229 EY Report, p. 42. \n230 EY Report, p. 45. \nD20/1/75\n \nPage 75 \n 245. The Bank’s 2018 financial statements included the restatement of the Fair Value of the \nTransferred Assets as of 31 December 2016.  The restated value of the Stadium was UAH 16.2 \nmillion, based on the value conclusion set out in Sineks Stadium Report.231  \n246. Mr. Thomas has introduced a further valuation of the Dnipro Stadium, using a valuation date \nof 6 June 2016.232  Mr. Thomas rejects the Cost and Market Approaches and uses only the \nIncome Approach to value the Stadium.233  Without direct access to operational and financial \ndata for the Dnipro Stadium, Mr. Thomas’s analysis draws on the data included in the \naforementioned valuation reports alongside additional publicly available information.234  Mr. \nThomas projects annual revenues for ticket sales, space rental, other events, parking, and \nadvertising, then subtracted VAT and stadium operating expenses to calculate projected annual \nEBITDA of UAH 18.8 million.  This EBITDA is then capitalized using a rate of 15 percent, \nproducing a value conclusion of UAH 125.4 million.235 \n247. Table 6 below summarizes the various value conclusions reached for the Stadium. \nTable 6 – Summary of Valuations of the Stadium \n \n248. Table 6 shows that the value conclusions range from a high of UAH 1,544 million (the \nVeritas Stadium Report) to a low of UAH 16 million (the Sineks Stadium Report).  Mr. \nThomas’s valuation, while significantly higher than the value at which the Stadium was \nrestated in the Bank’s 2016 financial statements is more than 90 percent lower than the \ncontemporaneous valuation reports prepared in 2015 and 2016. \n249. In my view, the restated value of the Dnipro Stadium of UAH 16 million, approximately \nUS$ 640,000, is illogical.  Given that the Stadium had been built at a cost of approximately \n \n231 PB0271021_00001. \n232 Expert Report of Paul R.

I strongly disagree with Mr. Thomas’s decision to disregard the Cost Approach in his \nvaluation of the Stadium.  Mr. Thomas justifies his exclusion of the cost approach as follows: \n \n“For the market valuation of the Training Center and the Stadium, I \nconsidered and rejected the use of the Cost Approach to value these \nassets. As I explain in the body of my report, as each of the Training \nCenter and Stadium are assets that can generate identifiable income \nstreams, the use of the Cost Approach to value the Training Center \nand Stadium would violate the standards and approaches to market \nvaluation of assets as set out in IVS 2013, which states at Page 67, \nParagraph C22:  \nThis approach is generally applied to the valuation of real property \ninterests through the depreciated replacement cost method. It is \nnormally used when there is either no evidence of transaction prices \nfor similar property or no identifiable actual or notional income \nstream that would accrue to the owner of the relevant interest. ”237 \n251. As I explain in my report, the appropriate standard of value in this matter is Fair Value, and \nFair Value calculations must be made in accordance with IFRS 13.  IFRS 13 does not express \nany preference for one valuation approach over another.  Instead, IFRS 13 requires the \nvaluation practitioner to adopt the approach that maximizes the use of observable inputs and \nminimizes the use of unobservable inputs.  Mr. Thomas acknowledges throughout his report \nthe limitations on the data available to him. \n“I have not been able to access any company-specific financial data, \nfinancial statements or other related financial or operational \ninformation, for either the Training Center or the Stadium. To \novercome this limitation, I have relied upon public sources of \n \n236 Thomas Report, Appendix 4.2.20. \n237 Thomas Report, Appendix 4.3.14. \nD20/1/77\n \nPage 77 \n revenue data, advertised prices and other public financial and market \ndata.”238 \n“The most significant limitation is the lack of access to financial \nstatements and related operational information of the companies that \nwere operating the Training Center and the Stadium as of June \n2016.”239 \n“As with my valuation of the Training Center, I recognize that there \nis some uncertainty in my valuation as a result of the limited \ninformation available to me and the assumptions I am forced to use \nin my valuation.”240 \n“Tickets sales are the main source of revenue at the Stadium. I do \nnot have actual revenue figures available to me.”241 \n“There are certain limitations to the information that is available to \nme in producing my valuations, which includes a lack of access to \nfinancial or other information beyond that reproduced and included \nin the 2015/2016 Valuation Reports and the 2019 Valuation \nReports.”242 \n252. Rather than make use of observable data on the costs incurred to construct the Stadium, Mr. \nThomas has opted to use unobservable data as the basis for his Income Approach.

Rather than make use of observable data on the costs incurred to construct the Stadium, Mr. \nThomas has opted to use unobservable data as the basis for his Income Approach. This is \ninconsistent with the Fair Value assessment guidelines set out in IFRS 13. \n253. Furthermore, even if the Income Approach were the most appropriate methodology, and I \nbelieve that it is not, I disagree with several assumptions that underlie Mr. Thomas’s revenue \ncalculations.  For example, Mr. Thomas has failed to consider revenues from Stadium naming \nrights, a significant revenue source for many stadium owners.  Mr. Thomas’s own source \ndocument indicates that naming rights account for an average of 8 percent of total revenues.243  \nIn addition, Mr. Thomas assumes the Stadium hosts three other events annually, generating \nrevenue of UAH 900,000, less than 4 percent of his total annual revenue forecast.244  Again \n \n238 Thomas Report, Appendix 4.3.10. \n239 Thomas Report, Appendix 4.3.11. \n240 Thomas Report, ¶ 4.70. \n241 Thomas Report, ¶ 4.24. \n242 Thomas Report, ¶ 2.15. \n243 International Stadia Operators Survey, 2012, p.8. https://dokumen.tips/documents/international-stadia-operators-\nsurvey-2012.html. \n244 Thomas Report, Table 4.9. \nD20/1/78\n \nPage 78 \n Mr. Thomas’s source indicates that, on average, stadiums host an average of 10 events, \naccounting for 15 percent of total revenue.245 \n254. Finally, Mr. Thomas attempts to use the sale of the Chernomorets stadium for UAH 193 \nmillion in 2020 as evidence his value conclusion for the Stadium is reasonable.246  I disagree \nwith Mr. Thomas that this sale supports his valuation.  The Chernomorets stadium was a \ndistressed asset involved in a forced sale, with buyers knowing that the stadium was likely to \nbe tied up in litigation.247  It took 17 attempts over the course of a full year to locate a buyer \nfor the Chernomorets stadium.248  I do not consider this to be an indication of the Market Value \nfor an asset comparable to the Dnipro Stadium. \n255. In my view, the Cost Approach is the methodology that maximizes the use of observable \ninputs and is therefore most consistent with the application of Fair Value under IFRS 13.  In \nmy view, the most relevant figure, for the purposes of establishing the Fair Value of the \nStadium as of 31 December 2016, is the value approved by the NBU of UAH 1,544 million.249   \nF. Dnipro Training Center \n256. The Dnipro Training Center is a complex of recreational facilities located at 12 and 14 \nPionerskyi Lane, Dnipro.250  In this subsection, I first provide a brief overview of the key \ncharacteristics of the Dnipro Training Center.  Second, I discuss the various valuation reports \nprepared for the Dnipro Training Center, and how these reports have been used to assess its \nFair Value. Third, I comment on the valuation of the Dnipro Training Center prepared by Mr. \nThomas.  Finally, I set out my own conclusion as to the most reasonable approach to assessing \nthe Fair Value of the Dnipro Training Center as of 31 December 2016. \n257. The Dnipro Training Center is located in Dnipro, one of the largest cities in Ukraine and the \ncapital of the Dnipropetrovsk region.251 The Dnipro Training Center is comprised of four grass \ntraining fields, an indoor arena with an artificial turn field, two main buildings, and several \n \n245 Stadia Consultancy, International Stadia Operators Survey, 2012, pp.8, 10.

I have not been provided with historical operating or financial data for the Dnipro Training \nCenter.  Thus, the only information available to me is that which is included in three third-\nparty valuation reports that were completed between 2015 and 2019.  Two reports were issued \nprior to 31 December 2016, the date on which the Fair Values of the Transferred Assets were \nrecorded in the Bank’s financial statements. \n259. First, UCE issued a report in 2015 (“UCE Training Center Report”), using a valuation date \nof 9 April 2015.253  UCE valued the Dnipro Training Center using a combination of the Cost \nApproach and the Market Approach.254  The real estate assets located at 12 Pionerskyi Lane, \nwhich included the indoor football field and its immediate surroundings, were valued using the \nCost Approach.255  The remainder of the Training Center Complex, located at 14 Pionerskyi \nLane, was valued using the Market Approach.256  UCE added the results of these analyses to \nreach a value conclusion of UAH 670.5 million.257 \n260. Second, Veritas issued a report on 18 August 2016 (“Veritas Training Center Report”) that \nvalued the Dnipro Training Center as of 30 June 2016.258  Veritas used only the Cost Approach \nto value the Dnirpro Training Center and reached a value conclusion of UAH 332.0 million.259   \n261. The Fair Value of the Dnipro Training Center was originally assessed at UAH 670.5 million \non the Bank’s financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2016, based on the \nconclusion reached in the UCE Training Center Report.260  I do not know why the UCE \nTraining Center Report, rather than the Veritas Training Center Report, was selected as the \n \n252 IK0007550_0001, p. 20. \n253 IK0007550_0001, p. 2. \n254 IK0007550_0001, p. 35. \n255 IK0007550_0001, p. 56. \n256 IK0007550_0001, pp. 52-56. \n257 IK0008209_0001, p. 66. \n258 PB0354177_00001, p. 3. \n259 PB0354177_00001, p. 71. \n260 Schedule of Transferred Assets, Schedule 1 to D1 RFI, 17 April 2020. \nD20/1/80\n \nPage 80 \n basis for the year-end 2016 Fair Value assessment of the Dnipro Training Center.

Using only the Income Approach, Sineks \nvalued the Dnipro Training Center at UAH 142.0 million, a 79 percent reduction from the \noriginally recognized Fair Value of UAH 670.5 million.264 \n264. The Bank’s 2018 financial statements included the restatement of the Fair Value of the \nTransferred Assets as of 31 December 2016.  The restated value of the Dnipro Training Center \nwas UAH 142.0 million, based on the value conclusion set out in Sineks Training Center \nReport.  \n265. Mr. Thomas has introduced his own valuation of the Dnipro Training Center, using a \nvaluation date of 6 June 2016.265  Mr. Thomas rejects the Cost and Market Approaches and \nuses only the Income Approach to value the Training Center.266  Without access to operational \nand financial data for the Training Center, Mr. Thomas’s analysis draws entirely on publicly \navailable information with no direct link to the Dnipro Training Center itself.267  Mr. Thomas \nestimates the daily fee per person the Dnipro Training Center could charge customers by \ncalculating the median fee charged by other European facilities operating in the sports tourism \n \n261 EY Report, p. 42. \n262 EY Report, p. 45. \n263 EY Report, p. 45. \n264 PB0271022_00001. \n265 Thomas Report, ¶ 1.8. \n266 Thomas Report, ¶ 2.18. \n267 Thomas Report, ¶ 3.31. \nD20/1/81\n \nPage 81 \n and recreation sector.268  He then estimates the occupancy rate for the Dnipro Training Center \nby referring to occupancy rate data for: 1) the global hotel market, 2) the US hotel market, 3) \nhotel markets in the “comparable” cities of Warsaw, Budapest, Vienna, and Prague, and 4) the \nKyiv hotel market.269  Net daily revenues are calculated by multiplying the daily revenues per \nperson (UAH 1,060) by the residential capacity of the Training Center (149 persons).  The \nresulting figure is then converted to an annual basis and adjusted for the occupancy rate (65 \npercent). Mr. Thompson then adopts an industry level EBITDA margin of 42 percent and a \ncapitalization rate of 15 percent, and generates a value conclusion for the Dnipro Training \nCenter of UAH 104.9 million.270 \n266. Table 7 below summarizes the various value conclusions reached for the Training Center. \nTable 7 – Summary of Valuations of the Training Center \n \n267. Table 7 above shows that the value conclusions range from a high of UAH 671 million (the \nUCE Training Center Report) to a low of UAH 105 million (the Thomas Report).   \n268. As discussed in the previous subsection with regard to the Dnipro Stadium, I strongly \ndisagree with Mr. Thomas’s decision to disregard the Cost Approach in his valuation of the \nTraining Center.  Again, IFRS 13 requires the valuation practitioner to adopt the valuation \ntechnique that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable \ninputs.  Mr. Thomas acknowledges in his report that the most important inputs to his valuation \nof the Dnipro Training Center are entirely unobservable. \n“The two most important variables to determine the market value \nusing the Income Approach are (1) the price charged per person per \nday for the package of hospitality services, including \naccommodation, offered by the Training Center, and (2) the total \n \n268 Thomas Report, Table 3.3. \n269 Thomas Report, ¶ 3.40. \n270 Thomas Report, Table 3.4.

Rather than make use of observable data on the costs incurred to construct the Training \nCenter, Mr. Thomas has opted to use unobservable data as the basis for his Income Approach. \nThis is inconsistent with the Fair Value guidelines set out in IFRS 13. \n270. In my view, the Cost Approach is the methodology that maximizes the use of observable \ninputs and is therefore most consistent with the application of Fair Value under IFRS 13.  In \nmy view, the most relevant figure for the purposes of establishing the Fair Value of the \nTraining Center as of 31 December 2016 is the value approved by the NBU of UAH 332.0 \nmillion.272   \nG. Airfield \n271. The Airfield is a complex of structures located at 2 Druzhby Street, Yubileinyi village (the \n“Airfield”).273  In this subsection, I first provide a brief overview of the key characteristics of \nthe Airfield.  Second, I discuss the various valuation reports prepared for the Airfield and how \nthese reports have been used to assess its Fair Value. Third, I comment on the valuation of the \nAirfield prepared by Mr. Thomas.  Finally, I set out my own conclusion as to the most \nreasonable approach to determine the Fair Value of the Airfield as of 31 December 2016. \n272. The Airfield is located in the village of Yubileinyi, on the northern outskirts of Dnipro.274 \nThe Airfield is not an operating airfield but instead a collection of approximately 40 real estate \nassets spread over two land plots with a total area of 139 hectares.275  The structures that \n \n271 Thomas Report, ¶¶ 3.30-3.31. \n272 EY Report, p. 45. \n273 Schedule of Transferred Assets, Schedule 1 to D1 RFI, 17 April 2020. \n274 PB0163550_00001, p. 27. \n275 PB0163550_00001, p. 25. \nD20/1/83\n \nPage 83 \n comprise the Airfield include a headquarters building as well as various service buildings, \nworkshops, and warehouses.276  Contemporaneous valuation reports conflict regarding the \ncondition of the buildings, with one valuer assessing the condition as “satisfactory” while the \nother assessed the condition of the buildings as “poor,” apart from the headquarters building \nwhich was judged to be in “good” condition.277   \n273.

First, UCE issued an undated report (“UCE Airfield Report”) using a valuation date of 18 \nJune 2015.278  UCE valued the Airfield using the Cost Approach.279  UCE determined that the \nreplacement cost of the Airfield buildings was UAH 25.0 million and that the value of the \nrights to use the underlying land plots was UAH 341.1 million.  UCE added these two \ncomponents and reached a value conclusion for the Airfield of UAH 366.1 million.280  \n275. Second, Kreston issued a report on 5 August 2016 (“Kreston Airfield Report”) that valued \nthe Airfield as of 1 July 2016.281  Like UCE, Kreston used the Cost Approach and valued the \nbuildings and structures separately from the land use rights.  Kreston valued the Airfield’s \nbuildings and structures at UAH 7.7 million and the rights to the underlying land at UAH 26.3 \nmillion.  Therefore, Kreston’s final value conclusion under the cost approach was UAH 34.0 \nmillion.282   \n276. The Fair Value of the Airfield was originally assessed at UAH 366.1 million on the Bank’s \nfinancial statements for the year ending 31 December 2016, based on the conclusion reached \nin the UCE Airfield Report.283  I do not know why the UCE Airfield Report, rather than the \nKreston Airfield Report, was selected as the basis for the year-end 2016 Fair Value conclusion \n \n276 PB0362846_00001, pp. 13-16. \n277 PB0362846_00001, p. 12.

The value pleaded by the First Defendant in the present proceedings is also \nUAH 366.1 million.   \n277. Shortly after the issuance of the Kreston Airfield Report, EY authored a report dated 22 \nNovember 2016 in which it reviewed and proposed adjustments to the initially recognized Fair \nValues for the Transferred Assets.284  According to EY, the NBU had “verified” a value of \nUAH 34.0 million for the Airfield, a 91 percent reduction from the initially recognized Fair \nValue of UAH 366.1 million.285  EY performed its own desktop review of two valuation \nreports, the second of which appears to have been the Kreston Airfield Report, and determined \nthat, although it was unable to form an opinion on the Fair Value of the Airfield, the likely \nvalue of the underlying land alone ranged from UAH 40 million to UAH 180 million.  Thus, \nEY opined that the Kreston valuation may have understated the Fair Value of the Airfield.286 \n278. One additional report assessing the value of the Airfield was produced after the initial \nrecognition of the Transferred Assets on the Bank’s balance sheet at the end of 2016.  AE \nprepared a report in January 2019 (“AE Airfield Report”) that valued the Airfield as of 31 \nDecember 2016.  Using the Income and Market Approaches, AE valued the Airfield at UAH \n3.6 million, a 99 percent reduction from the originally recognized Fair Value of UAH 366.1 \nmillion.287 \n279. The Bank’s 2018 financial statements included a restatement of the Fair Value of the \nTransferred Assets as of 31 December 2016.  The restated value of the Airfield was UAH 3.6 \nmillion, based on the value conclusion set out in the AE Airfield Report.  \n280.

When applying the Income Approach, Mr. Thomas first calculates a median rental price per \nsquare meter of UAH 19.13/m2 based on comparable properties listed for rent.  He then \nestimates annual EBITDA of UAH 0.9 million by applying this unit rate to the area of the \nAirfield and assuming a 90 percent occupancy rate, a 3 percent management fee, and an annual \nland payment.  This EBITDA projection is then capitalized at a rate of 15 percent, producing \na value conclusion of UAH 5.4 million.292  Finally, Mr. Thomas assigns a 40 percent weight \nto his Market Approach and a 60 percent weight to his Income approach, reaching a final value \nconclusion of UAH 5.7 million.293 \n282. Table 8 below summarizes the various value conclusions reached for the Airfield. \nTable 8 – Summary of Valuations of the Airfield \n \n283. Table 8 above shows that the value conclusions range from a high of UAH 366 million (the \nUCE Airfield Report) to a low of UAH 4 million (the AE Airfield Report).  Mr. Thomas’s \nvaluation, while higher than the value at which the Airfield was restated in the Bank’s 2016 \nfinancial statements, is significantly lower than the range EY indicated for the value of the \nAirfield land plots alone. \n284. As stated above, I disagree with Mr. Thomas’s statement that the Cost Approach is not \nappropriate.  Mr. Thomas suggests that the Cost Approach can never be used when an \n“identifiable income stream” exists, citing the IVS guidelines.294   \n \n291 Thomas Report, ¶ 5.36. \n292 Thomas Report, Table 5.6. \n293 Thomas Report, ¶ 5.53. \n294 Thomas Report Appendix 4.3.17.

In the passage \nquoted above, the IVS explains that, in cases where no comparables or stream of cash flows \nexist, the Cost Approach may be the only approach than can be applied.  The existence of \ncomparables and identifiable cash flows does not, however, preclude the use of the Cost \nApproach.  For example, the Cost Approach is regularly used to value early-stage mining \nprojects, despite the fact that transactions of comparable assets are common and notional \nincome streams projected. \n286. Regardless, specifically with respect to the Airfield, land value accounts for approximately \n80 percent and 93 percent of the total values set out in the Kreston Airfield Report and the \nUCE Airfield Report.296  These land values are estimated in much the same manner employed \nby Mr. Thomas, as they are calculated from unit prices derived from comparable assets.  \nTherefore, there is far less difference between the methodologies used by Mr. Thomas, \nKreston, and UCE to value the Airfield as compared to the Dnipro Stadium or Dnipro Training \nCenter. \n287. More importantly, as I explain in detail in my report, the appropriate standard of value in this \nmatter is Fair Value, and Fair Value calculations must be made in accordance with IFRS 13.  \nIFRS 13 does not express any preference for one valuation approach over another.  In my \nopinion, a valuation of the Airfield using the Cost Approach is compliant with IFRS 13. \n \n295 Thomas Report, Appendix 4.3.14. \n296 PB0362846_00001, p. 28; PB0163550_00001, p. 40. \nD20/1/87\n \nPage 87 \n 288. Finally, Mr. Thomas attempts to use the UAH 6.2 million auction price of the Airfield in \nAugust 2020 as a reasonableness check on his own valuation, which was conducted as of June \n2016.297  In my view, a sale conducted four years after the valuation date, amidst a global \npandemic, does not provide any relevant information that might inform a Fair Value \nassessment made four years prior. \n289. In my view, the most relevant figure, for the purposes of establishing the Fair Value of the \nAirfield as of 31 December 2016, is the value approved by the NBU of UAH 34 million.298   \nH. Summary of Valuations of Real Estate Assets \n290. Table 9 below summarizes the various valuation conclusions reached for each of the seven \nreal estate assets.   \nTable 9 – Summary of 2016 Fair Value Calculations for the Transferred Real Estate Assets \n \n291. Table 9 shows that my Fair Value determination for the Real Estate Assets is UAH 3,946 \nmillion, 23 percent lower than the value pleaded by the First Defendant but approximately \ntwice the sum of the value conclusions reached by Mr. Bezant and Mr. Thomas. \n Expert Declaration \n292.
