There has been virtually no attempt on the part of Ds to demonstrate \nthat no fraud took place: they declined to call a single factual witness to explain what \nhappened, resorting instead to a series of unevidenced speculations as to what “ alternative \nexplanations ” there might be ( e.g. the wrongdoing was carried out by the Bank’s pre-\nnationalisation CEO, Alexander Dubilet, and the Management Board; D2 was kept in the \ndark; it was unprompted “ firefighting ” by BOK staff, necessary because of strict currency \ncontrol and related-party regulations; the real wrongdoing took place before or after, but \ndefinitely not at the time of, the Relevant Loans). These ‘explanations’ are both spurious and \ndesperate. \n3 In the absence of any real response to the Bank’s factual case, Ds primarily seek to rely on \nan ever-increasing list of technical defences that seek to minimise or expunge their liability \n(limitation, no loss, venire contra factum proprium , currency). In respect of those defences, Ds \nrely primarily on expert evidence, where they did at least call some witnesses. One of the \nmany difficulties they face in that regard, however, is that their experts were lacking in \nindependence or credibility or both (Messrs Kaczmarek, Davidson, Alyoshin"}

In respect of those defences, Ds \nrely primarily on expert evidence, where they did at least call some witnesses. One of the \nmany difficulties they face in that regard, however, is that their experts were lacking in \nindependence or credibility or both (Messrs Kaczmarek, Davidson, Alyoshin and Nahnybida \ntick both boxes) and/or were nor asked or were unwilling to sign up to large parts of Ds’ \ncase (Messrs Marchukov and Steadman). \n4 The Bank is entitled to full compensation for its loss, which is not reduced – in fact or by \nany principle of Ukrainian law – by any of the further fraudulent steps put in place by D1-2 \nto cover their tracks. To the limited extent that D1-2 can show that they used the \nmisappropriated monies to pay off other of their liabilities (whether legitimate or \nillegitimate), that does not reduce the Bank’s loss either – as even Mr Alyoshin agreed. The \ncurrency of the Bank’s loss should be USD as that was how it felt its loss, or failing that in \nthe currency of the Relevant Drawdowns (and hence mostly USD by value).  \nA2 THE DEFENDANTS ’ FALSE AND DISHONEST DEFENCES  \n5 Even though they failed to put forward any factual evidence, and even though both D1 and \nD2 spent much of the time seemingly accepting that there had been large scale fraud in 2013 \nAA2/15/8\n2 and 2014 (indeed D1’s position at trial appeared to be that his fraud was so obvious, and so \nobviously for his benefit, that a claim should have been brought against him immediately \nafter nationalisation), neither of them has abandoned any part of their pleaded Defences. \nThose Defences, supported by statements of truth, have now been exposed as a catalogue \nof falsehoods. \n6 D1 still pleads in his seven-times amended Defence that he was “ not responsible for the decisions \nmade by the Bank to grant loans [...] All such decisions were made by the Chairman of the Management \nBoard ”, that he “ did not procure, and was not aware of, the grant of the Relevant Loan Facilities, the \nadvances of funds pursuant to them, the Supply Agreements or the Loan File Supply Agreements ”, that he \ndid not control any of the Borrowers or Defendant Suppliers or Primecap or PBC, and that \n“repayment of sums outstanding under the Relevant Loan Facilities was fully secured [by the Share \nPledges ]”.1 \n7 D2 still pleads in his six-times amended Defence that he did “ not control the Bank in any relevant \nrespect ”, that “ he did not control any of the Borrowers and, if they did enter into the various agreements \nalleged by the Bank, it was not with  [D2’s] knowledge or on his instructions ”, that he “ denies that he \nknowingly benefited from any misappropriation of the Bank’s funds ”, that he “ does not own or control any \nof [D3-8 or Primecap or PBC ]”, and that he “ is not acquainted with any of   [Yesipova, Ivlev, Kravchenko \nor Pereviznyi ]”.2 \n8 D3-8’s five-times amended Defence still pleads that they “ are not and were not from January \n2013 ultimately owned and/or controlled by [D1-2 ]” and that D3-5 “ executed supply agreements and \nreceived prepayments under those agreements for their principals, in the good faith belief that they were genuine \ntransactions ”. D6-8’s position remains that they “ concluded supply agreements at arm’s length and \nwith the intention of performing them ” even though D1-2 accept – and to an extent rely upon – \nthe RSAs being shams.3 \n9 It is now plain that these denials, and many more passages in Ds’ current defences purporting \nto support them, are simply untrue. Take for example: \n(1) D1-8’s claim that D1-2 did not to own or control D3-8. This claim is directly falsified \nby the available documentary evidence.

Take D1’s receipt of a WhatsApp message on \n9.8.16 reading: “ Promptly prepare claims for Privat freezing orders to be revoked. 4 accounts and \n1 pending ” {K5-A1/24/7}. The accounts in question belonged to D4 and D6-8 (with \n \n1  D1’s RRRRRRA Defence {A1/8} (¶¶7(2)(a)(i), 8(4), 10(1), 10A, 10B(2), 10C(2)(a), 18, 20(2)). \n2  D2’s RRRRRA Defence {A1/18} (¶¶5(2)(a), 5(2)(b), 5(3), 16(1), 17(1), 18B(2)(a), 18C(2)(a), 18C(3)(a)). \n3  D3-8’s RRRRA Defence {A1/20} (¶¶11(1), 11(2)(a), 11(2)(b)). \nAA2/15/9\n3 the arrest of D3’s account pending), which had been frozen by the General \nProsecutor. Primecap duly instructed lawyers and the freezing orders were revoked \nwithin six weeks. Why would D1 be interested in doing any of this if these companies \nhad, in fact, been defrauding his Bank without his knowledge and approval? Moving \nforwards a year, D3-5 issued – within three working days of the publication of articles \nin ‘Law and Business’ Magazine – defamation proceedings seeking to vindicate their \nnon-existent business reputations. This can only have been on the instructions and for \nthe benefit of D1-2, to create lis alibi pendens  arguments (duly relied upon to challenge \nthe jurisdiction of the English Court). Later, shortly after these proceedings were \nissued, D1 met D3 and D5’s Cypriot CSP, Sofocleous, following which D3 and D5 \nwere each invoiced €29,750 for “ attending meeting in Geneva with…IK ” and “ changing the \nrecords of 167 companies ” {E17/242.6/2}. That can only be a reference to 167 companies \nwithin D1-2’s corporate stable. Then take the funding of D3-8’s defence of these \nclaims, coming from ( inter alia ) Sanderlyn and Versala (whose bank balances were \nprovided to D1 on a near daily basis in 2019 {K5-A1/40/2-53}) and Sergei Melnyk \n(a man who holds a large number of assets for D1-2 under oral agreements and whom, \nit has recently emerged, D2 was employing on a full time basis at the salary of €7,500 \nper month {K8-B2/25/3} at the same time as he was paying £1.3m of D3-5’s legal \nfees). Indeed, it was not only Melnyk that D2 started to employ post-nationalisation: \nas has recently been revealed, two more of D3-5’s purported UBOs – Yesipova and \nIvlev – were also engaged by D2 via his company, Sunaltezza {K8-B1/1}. \n(2) D1-2’s claims not to own or control PBC. Again, D1-2 still maintain this plea, even \nthough they produced no evidence from either themselves, from PBC’s boss (their \nadmitted nominee Melnyk), or from any other PBC employee. And again, it is directly \nfalsified by the available documents. During the Misappropriation, PBC was located \nin the same building as Timur Novikov’s Investment Business; it had “ Privat ” in its \ninitial name (as D1’s counsel put to one of the Bank’s witnesses: “ Everyone in Ukraine \nknew at this time that if you referred to Privat and the Privat Group, you were referring to what \npeople regarded as the businesses of Kolomoisky and Bogolyubov? ” {Day8/33:17-20}); its staff \nadmittedly held extremely valuable assets for D1-2 under oral arrangements (or, as it \nwas belatedly suggested by D2, arrangements that arose “ by conduct and implication ”); \nand D1-2 have also been forced to admit fractional interests in PBC. The notion that \nD1-2 did not own and control PBC beggars belief. Furthermore, it is now plain that \nMelnyk, Yesipova and Ivlev were not the only former PBC staff who were moved \nAA2/15/10\n4 across from Dnipro to Cyprus in the aftermath of the Bank’s nationalisation.

The notion that \nD1-2 did not own and control PBC beggars belief. Furthermore, it is now plain that \nMelnyk, Yesipova and Ivlev were not the only former PBC staff who were moved \nAA2/15/10\n4 across from Dnipro to Cyprus in the aftermath of the Bank’s nationalisation. Eleven \nPBC staff relocated in all, of whom Kravchenko and Pereviznyi warrant special \nmention given that they are purported UBOs of 27 Borrowers and 15 Intermediary \nBorrowers (Kravchenko) and 28 Borrowers and 11 Intermediary Borrowers \n(Pereviznyi) respectively.  \n(3) D1-2’s claim not to own or control Primecap. Again, this is still maintained by D1-2; \nagain, neither they, nor D1-2’s “ righthand man ” Novikov, nor any Primecap staff were \ntendered to give evidence. The documents show that Primecap’s staff moved to \nCyprus from Novikov’s Investment Division in c. 2010; Primecap staff have acted as \nD1-2 nominees in relation to 33 of D1’s and 80 of D2’s admitted assets; and there can \nbe no dispute that Novikov is and was the Primecap “ boss”, whose role (as explained \nin his own witness statement in the Pinchuk Proceedings) was “ that of a  subordinate  \nrequired to act ” on D1-2’s instructions {I3/12/3} ( ¶9). D1-2 also admit that they owned \n100% of Primecap’s shares as of January 2011. But the Court is being asked to believe \n(without any evidence being tendered) that there was a management buy-out later in \n2011, notwithstanding D1 being asked, in October 2016 and at “ Timur [’s]” request, to \npay “ Primecap tax and soc. insur ” {K5-A1/42/4}, to which he agreed. Moving forwards \ntwo months, Marina Markova (then a Cyprus branch employee) was installed within \nPrimecap within two days of the Bank’s nationalisation (as D2 told Anischenko: \n“Explain everything to Markova. … She is now in Primec [a]p” {K8-D/1}).  \n(4) D1-2’s claim not to control any of the Borrowers. This is another claim maintained \nwithout any evidence from any of the nominees or directors who were the purported \nowners and directors of the Borrowers. With de minimis  exceptions, the Borrowers \nwere purportedly owned by PBC nominees; their directors were PBC employees; and \nthe structures through which they were held were often the very same structures as \nare found in D1-2’s asset disclosure. Indeed, D1-2 have been forced to admit 100% \ninterests in two Borrowers (although they inexplicably deny control of them), and \nminority interests in 19 (D1) / 17 (D2) further Borrowers. The Borrowers were used \nidentically, indeed interchangeably, in the Misappropriation – part of what D2’s \ncounsel described as a “ flotilla of convenient vessels ” {Day7/24:12} with purported owners \nwho were “ fungible ” (D2 Opening/¶21 {AA4/1/11}). D2’s statement that “ it was in \nfact employees of the Bank, Primecap and/or PBC who administered the ‘Scheme’ and/or determined \nhow the Borrowers participated in the ‘Scheme’ ” (D2 Opening/¶160(8)(b) {AA4/1/67}) is \nin the circumstances tantamount to an admission of guilt. And D1 was able to procure \nAA2/15/11\n5 that all these companies deliver up thousands of pages of paper bank statements in \nshort order in June 2018. Despite all these points, the pretence that these shell \nBorrowers with “ fungible ” UBOs – granted vast loans from D1-2’s bank, purportedly \nsecured over shares in D1-2’s companies – were somehow controlled by someone \nother than D1-2 is maintained to this day. \n(5) D1-2’s claim not to control the Bank. This was always a preposterous position, made \nall the worse by D1-2’s refusal to give evidence. D1-2 were at all material times the \n90%+ shareholders of the Bank; were two of the three members of its Supervisory \nBoard, by virtue of which they appointed the Management Board; and had close \nrelationships with the Bank’s most senior executives (Dubilet, Novikov, Yatsenko, \nGurieva, Gorokhovsky). Critically, those relationships continued notwithstandin"}
{"start": 49000, "text": ". \n(5) D1-2’s claim not to control the Bank. This was always a preposterous position, made \nall the worse by D1-2’s refusal to give evidence. D1-2 were at all material times the \n90%+ shareholders of the Bank; were two of the three members of its Supervisory \nBoard, by virtue of which they appointed the Management Board; and had close \nrelationships with the Bank’s most senior executives (Dubilet, Novikov, Yatsenko, \nGurieva, Gorokhovsky). Critically, those relationships continued notwithstanding ( i) \nthe NBU’s trenchant criticisms of the Bank’s operation in 2014-15; ( ii) the NBU \nrequiring D1-2 to transfer their valuable assets to the Bank as part of the Restructuring \nPlan; and ( iii) the Bank’s nationalisation. Dubilet garnered confidential information \nfor both D1 and D2 from within the Bank post-nationalisation and got a ‘Black’ \nextension in D1-2’s Geneva offices; Gurieva hot-footed it to Geneva in January 2018 \nfollowing service of the WFO to prepare the Lafferty Spreadsheets; and (at least) \nNovikov, Yatsenko and Gorokhovsky attended meetings with D1 and D2 in Geneva \nin February 2018. If the Bank’s Management Board had perpetrated the \nMisappropriation without D1-2’s knowledge and for the benefit of some other \n(unidentified) individual, D1-2’s reactions would have been very different indeed. See \nD1’s chilling threats to Ms Rozhkova (“ tiger in a cage ”; “very long arms ” {B1/5/54} \n(¶218)) and the protests they organised outside the NBU’s offices and Ms Rozhkova’s \nhome, complete with coffins and funeral bands ( e.g. {K5-A2/6/45}); none of which \nhas been denied. \n(6) D2’s claim not to have benefited from any misappropriation of the Bank’s funds. This \noutlandish claim, emphasised by counsel in D2’s oral opening, has backfired. \nNotwithstanding his abysmal approach to disclosure, the available contemporaneous \ndocuments contain copious references to D2’s direct benefit. Thus BOK documents \nshow that the lending to the Borrowers was for D1-2’s companies and projects (see \nthe repeated references to Kievguma/the rubber project, Hotel Split, the Shah’s \nPalace, the Illichivsky Marine Fish Port etc. in BOK emails and spreadsheets); the \nBank’s financial statements show that the Bank’s loan book was dominated by lending \nto sectors in which D1-2 hold substantial interests (it is inconceivable they were \nAA2/15/12\n6 lending in such enormous volumes to their competitors); and the Lafferty \nSpreadsheets analysis showed that US$452m went – via ‘break points’ – to D1-2’s own \ncompanies. Indeed, even D1’s forensic accountancy expert cannot deny that funds \ncan be followed to ( i) a D1-2 operating company, ( ii) D2’s own current account, and \n(iii) the purchase of an aircraft for D1. \n(7) D1’s claim that the Relevant Loans were fully secured. D1 told the Court as part of \nhis discharge application that there was collateral for all the Relevant Loans over \n“shares in valuable companies with significant production and trading activities generating cashflows \nand holding real assets ... [it] was examined and accepted by PwC over successive audits ” \n{H2/8/19} (¶¶85-6). That position was maintained in his Defence (Relevant Loans \nwere “ fully secured ”), following which the experts exchanged 1,415 pages of reports \nvaluing some 25 companies. Indeed, D1 continued to challenge the Bank’s valuation \nevidence (the Share Pledges were overstated by 89-96%) until Day 17 of trial. And he \nmaintains his Share Pledge pleading to this day ({Day 18/193:6}: “ I can clarify that. We \nstand by our defence ”), notwithstanding that he abandoned his own evidence on the point \nand chose not to challenge the Bank’s evidence. \n(8) D3-8’s claim that they thought the Relevant Supply Agreements would be performed. \nD3-8 had no business, and neither did D3-5’s Alleged Principals.

And, when the NBU put a stop to this \npractice in September 2014, BOK, PBC and Primecap coordinated collusive \nproceedings by the Borrowers against D3-8, paid for by yet further advances from the \nBank. \nA3 THE DEFENDANTS ’ EFFORTS TO COVER THEIR TRACKS  \n10 To prevent their fraudulent conduct from being exposed, D1-2 have deliberately restricted \nthe documentary record available to the Court: \n(1) As experienced fraudsters, D1-2 took steps before and during the proceedings to \nensure that relevant documents would not be available, including ( i) adopting a general \n‘burn after reading’ policy to hard copy documents; ( ii) discarding mobile phones and \nfailing to identify relevant devices; ( iii) deleting the content of email accounts and \nAA2/15/13\n7 ‘forgetting’ passwords; and ( iv) feigning an inability to obtain documents from \ncompanies and individuals which were plainly under D1-2’s control.  \n(2) D1-2 have adopted a disgraceful approach to disclosure: ( i) the Court rightly described \nobtaining Primecap documents from D1 (who was managing the exercise for himself \nand D2) as “ akin to squeezing blood out of a stone ”; (ii) D1-2’s absurdly restrictive approach \nto disclosing WhatsApp messages meant that, as at March 2022, the only message \nbetween the two men available to the Court was a single digit (‘1’) {H1/55.1} and it \nwas only following the Court’s April 2022 judgment that thousands of further \nWhatsApp messages were revealed; ( iii) neither D1 nor D2 identified PBC as a \ncustodian of documents and, when the Bank itself identified PBC in December 2021, \nit was told that “ PBC’s entire email server along with backup copies no longer exist ” {H4/34/5}; \nand ( iv) D1-2 deliberately omitted Grizal and Sunaltezza as disclosure custodians, \ndespite D2’s Sunaltezza subsequently becoming the employer of 11 PBC nominees by \nagreement between D1 and D2. \nA4 THE DEFENDANTS ’ EVIDENTIARY VOLTE FACE \n11 The Court was told by D1’s counsel at the WFO return date hearing that “ obviously, if the \nmatter ever goes to trial one would need to explain what was going on and why this was being done and so \non, whether there was any dishonest intent ” {G3/12/8} (p.28:2-5). D1-2 then filed witness \nstatements in late 2021 which, although sparse, sought to offer certain factual assertions \n(notably Yatsenko’s statement, which accepted that the supply agreements were shams). \n12 But as the Bank slowly prised more and more documents out of D1-2, they realised that \nthey would be exposed as the liars and fraudsters that they are if they entered the witness \nbox. And so – having relied on their intention to give evidence in person as a reason to \nadjourn the 2022 trial – they pulled their evidence, without explanation, at the eleventh hour. \nThat is a remarkable volte face . \n13 It is all the more remarkable given that, while continuing to maintain the factual averments \nin their Defences, each of the Ds now accepts to a greater or lesser extent that there was, \nindeed, an epic fraud and money laundering on a vast scale: \n(1) D1 began by saying that “ the Bank’s factual case against him is irrelevant ” (D1 \nOpening/¶88, original emphasis {AA3/1/29}).

But during the trial, his counsel (no \ndoubt on instructions) put it to the Bank’s witnesses that it was so obvious that D1-2 \nhad defrauded the Bank that proceedings should have been started within days of \nGlavcom’s article dated 7.11.14 ( e.g. “it’s obvious that the Bank ... would have claims against \nAA2/15/14\n8 its shareholders for having transited the Bank’s money to their companies ” {Day8/96:2-5}), and \nhe caveated his questions of the Bank’s forensic accountancy expert with the words: \n“leave aside the propriety of all this ” {Day23/54:16-17}. \n(2) For his part, D2 opened with the concession that the Relevant Loans were granted “ in \na manner that was clandestine and contrary to all principles of prudent banking ” {AA4/1/7} ( ¶7). \nHowever, having made that concession, D2 sought in submissions to blame his close \nassociate Dubilet. That stood in stark contrast to D2’s abandoned trial evidence, which \ndescribed Dubilet as an “ experienced and talented banker ” whose “ good management ”, after \nhe became CEO in 1998, “ grew” the Bank so that it became the “ biggest bank in Ukraine ” \n{B2/11} ( ¶¶45, 50). \n(3) D3-8, for their part, have not amended their pleaded case that “ arm’s length ” and \n“genuine ” supply agreements were entered into in “ good faith ” and with the “ intention of \nperforming them ”. But they provided no evidence to support that and, in opening, \nappeared to accept that they were involved in some form of money laundering, \ndescribing their receipt of funds as “ … what I would call the game of hot potato. The hot \npotato was being quickly flung person to person and then as at August 2014 we had the misfortune \nto be holding the hot potato ” {Day7/87:3-12}. \nA5 OTHER EXTRAORDINARY FEATURES OF THE TRIAL  \n14 There were some other extraordinary features of the trial to be mentioned at the outset. \n15 First, many of the Bank’s witnesses made the arduous journey to London to give evidence \nto assist the Court. They did so because Ds maintained that they wished to challenge their \nevidence, with almost two weeks set aside for this. However, in the end, three witnesses \n(having travelled to London) were not cross-examined at all; and those that were – giving \nevidence in their second language or via an interpreter – faced needlessly hostile, meandering \nand on occasion baffling questioning from D1 in particular. Nonetheless, all of the Bank’s \nwitnesses gave clear and credible evidence, and all were manifestly seeking to assist the \nCourt. \n16 Secondly, D1 presented the Court with the most remarkable collection of expert witnesses. \nThese individuals were manifestly incompetent or brazenly partisan, and often both: \n(1) Mr Davidson (Forensic accountancy). Mr Davidson was ‘cessated’ as a chartered \naccountant in April 2023, but failed to inform the Court of that fact until just a few \ndays before he gave evidence, and only after it had been uncovered by the Bank. But \nAA2/15/15\n9 it got worse: Mr Davidson claimed the privilege against self-incrimination on the basis \nthat his answers would give rise to a real risk of incriminating him of two separate \nfrauds – one on a charity, and the other on his former accountancy firm {L/220.2} \n(¶¶10-23). As for the substance, Mr Davidson was clearly out of his depth and seeking \nto do no more than advance points that he thought helpful to D1. Indeed, when he \ngot stuck in relation to a hypothetical which showed that the Use of Funds and \nRepayment Defences could not be combined, he dissembled for five minutes before \na remarkable intervention from Mr Howard KC, "}

Indeed, when he \ngot stuck in relation to a hypothetical which showed that the Use of Funds and \nRepayment Defences could not be combined, he dissembled for five minutes before \na remarkable intervention from Mr Howard KC, who stood up and (despite being told \nby the Court not to do so) fed Mr Davidson what counsel thought the answer ought \nto be {Day25/22:19} - {Day25/24:4}. \n(2) Mr Alyoshin (Ukrainian law). Mr Alyoshin’s evidence was nothing short of a complete \ndisgrace. His reports were partisan and misleading. He omitted sections of authorities \nwhich did not support D1’s case: lowlights included the Antonyuk, Karnaukh and \nStepanchuk articles on abuse of rights; the Guivan article on limitation (“ I saw that his \nview was a little bit different from mine but I didn’t think that I should somehow say that ... ”); and \nthe omitted passages of authorities on venire contra factum proprium . He was willing to \nreverse his position to suit D1’s changing case, notably on attribution of knowledge \nfor the purposes of limitation and whether detrimental reliance was a requirement of \nvenire contra factum proprium . His oral evidence was evasive, obstinate and lacking any \nsemblance of independence. In light of all this, it is unsurprising that, when asked \nwhether he had a duty to draw attention to a decision of the Supreme Court which \nwas adverse to his position, his answer was: “ I don’t know ” {Day31/31:23} - \n{Day31/32:1}. Instead, he essentially admitted having approached his role as an \nadvocate for D1, saying that “ I have a certain view, as an expert on Ukrainian law, and to \nsupport my view I refer to some authority which support my view, and that’s what I did ” \n{Day29/141:7-10}. \n(3) Mr Seymour (Aircraft valuation). Mr Seymour admitted to making a string of basic \nmistakes in his first report, which had to be corrected by the Bank’s expert, Ms \nRazzhivina. He also accepted that he had been previously criticised by Tomlinson, \nTeare and Henshaw JJ (judgments not drawn to the Court’s attention until days before \nhe got into the box). On the substance, Mr Seymour provided no details that could be \nscrutinised and accepted that his approach amounted to telling the Court: “ I’ve got a \ngood company and the court should trust that I got it right ” {Day18/121:23-25}. \nAA2/15/16\n10 (4) Mr Kaczmarek (Asset Transfer valuation). Mr Kaczmarek produced absurdly high \nvaluations for the Transferred Assets – for instance, he valued the Petrol Stations at \nalmost UAH 2bn more than they had been valued (on the basis of fraudulently inflated \nfuel volume data) in 2016. When the Bank pointed to that falsified data, D1 pivoted \nto Mr Kaczmarek’s purportedly comparable petrol station transactions. On analysis, \nhowever, those transactions were anything but comparable – and they were presented \nin a thoroughly misleading manner.4 Another example of Mr Kaczmarek’s unfair \npresentation arose when he relied on his own valuation in a prior arbitration, without \nmentioning that the tribunal had reduced it by 25%. His explanation – that he \ndisagreed with the tribunal’s decision – showed a breath-taking lack of self-awareness \nand independence {Day21/66:17-22}. \nA6 THE DEFENDANTS ’ NEW FOCUS  \n17 It is instructive to identify the five points that Ds have focused on at trial: \n(1) First, D1’s argument that the Bank’s claims are limitation barred because the \nMisappropriation was so blatant and obviously for D1’s benefit that a claim could \nhave been brought within 44 days of the publication of the Glavcom article on 7.11.14. \n(2) Secondly, that D2 had no involvement in, or knowledge of, the Misappropriation and \ndid not benefit from it. \n(3) Thirdly, D1’s argument (advanced th"}

We address limitation in Section L , where we explain that: \n(1) The short answer to this defence is that the Bank’s Charter at the relevant time gave \nthe Bank’s Supervisory Board (of which D1-2 held two of the three seats) the exclusive \nlegal power to institute legal proceedings against Bank officers. D1-2 also had \ncomplete de facto control. Applying the correct approach as a matter of Ukrainian law, \nD1-2 are therefore the people whose knowledge is to be attributed to the Bank for \nthe purposes of Art. 261 CC. Given that D1-2 were guilty of defrauding the Bank, the \nexperts agree that their knowledge of the fraud did not start time running. \n(2) The same conclusion would follow even if the Bank’s Management Board was the \nbody with legal authority to institute proceedings: there was no way that this body \nwould have ever resolved to do so. Quite aside from anything else, nine of its 16 \nmembers voted in favour of at least 120 of the 134 Relevant Loans (Dubilet, Pikush, \nGorokhovsky, Novikov, Yatsenko, Chmona, Gurieva, Kandaurov and \nKryzhanovskiy) – lending that D2 avers was “ clandestine and contrary to all standards of \nprudent banking ”. These members were all involved in the Misappropriation and so \ntheir knowledge is not to be attributed to the Bank for the purpose of Art. 261. Indeed, \nthe notion that any member of the D1-2-appointed Management Board would have \ninvestigated D1-2 or voted to instigate proceedings against them is fanciful: virtually \nall of them had close links with D1-2; and everyone in the Bank knew that D1-2 were \nnot men to be crossed, not least because D1 was in 2014 the Governor of the \nDnipropetrovsk region and the head of a private militia. \n(3) Even if, contrary to the above, there was some person at the Bank who was not \nimplicated in the Misappropriation, but nevertheless knew about it, that would not \nhave started time running under Art. 261: in the circumstances prevailing at the time, \nthe Bank would have had no opportunity to commence a claim. In the real world: \n(a) Anyone brave or foolhardy enough to try to start an investigation into D1-2 \nwould have been sacked or worse. In this regard, the Bank’s initial reaction to \npublication of both the Glavcom and Nashi Groshi articles was to institute \nurgent internal investigations about how information was obtained by the press \n(and not about the underlying allegations of fraud).

{"start": 66500, "text": "1: in the circumstances prevailing at the time, \nthe Bank would have had no opportunity to commence a claim. In the real world: \n(a) Anyone brave or foolhardy enough to try to start an investigation into D1-2 \nwould have been sacked or worse. In this regard, the Bank’s initial reaction to \npublication of both the Glavcom and Nashi Groshi articles was to institute \nurgent internal investigations about how information was obtained by the press \n(and not about the underlying allegations of fraud). \n(b) And if, for some reason, this hypothetical person remained in the Bank’s \nemployment, they would have been rebuffed by those loyal to D1-2 – as the \nBank rebuffed requests made by the General Prosecutor’s Office ( “GPO” ) in \n{AA2/15/303}\nAA2/15/18\n12 January 2015. And, in any event, they would have been told (as the NBU was \ntold in March 2015) that the Relevant Loans were all legitimate and supported \nby 612 items of security. \n(c) There was, in any event, no prospect whatsoever of this person obtaining \nsufficient information about the Misappropriation to plead a case within 44 days \nof the Glavcom article being published in Ukraine’s equivalent of The Sun . \nIndeed, when the NBU opened an investigation on 24.3.15 into potential breach \nof money-laundering rules in connection with the Misappropriation (following \nthe later Nashi Groshi, and not the Glavcom, article), it was given false \ninformation by the Bank as to the Borrowers’ beneficial ownership, and \nconcluded on 15.5.15 (in a 121-page report) that whilst the Bank should “ consider \nthe need to continue its business with the [Borrowers ] who engage in risky financial \ntransactions ”, the Borrowers were not connected to D1-2, or any other Bank \ninsiders {E9/214.1}. \n(d) Lastly, and perhaps most obviously of all, such a hypothetical person would \nnever have been able to procure the issuing of proceedings by the Bank against \nD1-2: D1-2 and the numerous senior officers who were loyal to them would \nnever have allowed that.  \n(4) If, contrary to all of the above, time did start to run, then this would be a paradigm \ncase for the disapplication of the limitation period under Art. 267(5) CC. The correct \napproach to that, set out for example in the Supreme Court’s decision in Sirius-Bud, \nis that the court looks at the whole of the period and all the circumstances, including \nwhether the conduct complained of was fraudulent, whether the old management was \nimplicated, whether there were steps taken to conceal it, and whether the investigation \nof the true facts was complicated. On the extreme facts of this case, all of those factors \nwere present and all justify disapplication. Furthermore, the Bank’s new management, \ninstalled in late December 2016, plainly acted reasonably in their approach to \ninvestigating and commencing the claim, which they managed to do within a year. \n(5) As to that, the Bank’s new management were presented with the nearly impossible \ntask of stabilising a systemic bank that had been catastrophically mismanaged; they \nworked 14-hour days, seven days a week, for the first three months to stave off a run \non the Bank (which, given the Bank’s size, may have led to civil unrest and/or the \ncollapse of the Ukrainian financial system); and they established a unit to investigate \nAA2/15/19\n13 related party lending which looked into the 200+ related-party loans and the purported \nsecurity for the same. Against that background, it was wholly reasonable to give D1-2 \na short period (until July 2017) to make good on the promise that they had made to \nthe Ukrainian Prime Minister – in an open letter – that they would, by 1.7.17, “ ensure \nthe restructuring of loans extended by the Bank to legal persons ” {E17/40}, and to instruct \nHogan Lovells when that promise was broken.

Ownership and control of the Bank is addressed in Section D  below, \nfocusing on D2 (the facts being, on his own case, “ irrelevant ” to D1’s defence). In that section, \nwe summarise the numerous reasons which – in addition to D2’s failure to offer any \nevidence – make it plain that D2 acted in lockstep with D1 and instigated, approved and \nbenefited from the Misappropriation. By way of example only: \n(1) D2 held a c. 45% interest in the Bank and was the Chairman of its Supervisory Board \nduring the whole of the period of the Misappropriation. He has sought (without any \nevidence) to falsify history by saying that his role was always “ limited and formal ” and \nthat he had a “ purely nominal ” and “ purely formal ” role after 1.7.14. The documents show \nthe reverse: D2 was involved in a wide range of the Bank’s business, including in \nrelation to lending, subordinated debt, financial recovery plans, NBU stabilisation \nloans, related party letters, annual accounts, the Restructuring Plan, the appointment \nof the Management Board and much more. Indeed, it is telling D2 and Dubilet spoke \n108 times for 455 minutes in the period from 3.2.14 to 1.6.14 (though there would \nhave been many more meetings, WhatsApp exchanges, conversations on the ‘Black’ \netc. as well). \n(2) It is wholly implausible to suppose that D2 did not know about the Misappropriation \nwhile D1 and the Management Board did: ( i) D2 had an umbilical relationship with \nD1; ( ii) D2 had close relationships with the Management Board, and in particular \nDubilet and Novikov; ( iii) (more widely) D2’s companies were used in the \nMisappropriation, which was also for his benefit; and ( iv) far from having no \n“acquaint [ance]” with the plethora of PBC nominees who are said to be the true \nbeneficial owners of the Borrowers and D3-8, evidence has emerged – despite D2’s \n{AA2/15/88}\nAA2/15/20\n14 best efforts to suppress it – to show that he was in fact employing them in and after \n2017 via his company Sunaltezza. \n(3) It is instructive to consider D2’s reaction when sent the NBU’s excoriating 2014 audit \nreport into the Bank on 27.3.15, when he had to charge his assets to the NBU to \nsupport stabilisation loans, when he had to transfer his assets to the Bank as part of \nthe Asset Transfer, when the Bank was nationalised, and even when these proceedings \nwere brought. At each of these stages, D2’s reaction was the opposite of what an \ninnocent person in his position would have done. Rather than insist on investigation, \ntaking disciplinary action or proceedings against Management Board members he now \nsays were responsible, or reporting them to the criminal authorities: he voted for re-\nappointment of the Management Board in his capacity as Chair of the Supervisory \nBoard; he praised the Management Board as shareholder; and he charged/contributed \nhis assets to the NBU/Bank in 2014 – 2016. \n(4) Post-nationalisation, D2 also maintained relationships with the individuals who \nconducted the Misappropriation. Dubilet, for instance, provided D2 with the Bank’s \nlatest related parties list by email sent on 6.2.17 (probably from D1-2’s Geneva office, \nwhere he was duly installed); Novikov sent D2 155 WhatsApp messages during the \nreturn date hearing; D2’s decades-long relationship with D1 is as strong as ever; and \nPrimecap and its “ boss” continue to administer D2’s assets, in conjunction with the \nPBC nominees (now"}

If D2 really knew nothing about \nthe Misappropriation, why on earth would he do any of this? His case, after all, is that \n“it was in fact employees of the Bank, Primecap and/or PBC ” who committed an epic fraud \nagainst his Bank. \n21 Ukrainian law . Despite D1’s efforts to characterise Ukrainian law as a truly ‘foreign’ and \nundeveloped body of law which places heavy reliance upon criminal findings of liability, \nrecognises no civil law wrong of misappropriation or theft, imposes only limited and \nformalistic duties upon its company officers, and applies strict and mechanistic notions of \ncausation, the reality is very different. Whatever may have been true of its Soviet-era \nprecursor, the Ukrainian law of the 2020s, as demonstrated by the modern jurisprudence of \nthe Supreme Court and its Grand Chamber, reveal a legal system that is conscious of \nUkraine’s ECHR obligations and the overriding principles of reasonableness, justness and \ngood faith; that looks to European legal principles and international corporate governance \nAA2/15/21\n15 demands in interpreting Ukrainian law; and that is ready to accord due discretion to the fact-\nfinding court to conduct its own evaluation of the evidence presented to it.  \n22 The applicable principles of Ukrainian law are addressed in Section I  below. As set out \nthere, the range of unappealing and technical arguments raised by Ds to explain why they \ncannot be civilly liable to the Bank for the misappropriation of its funds, primarily advanced \nby the partisan, misleading and thoroughly unreliable evidence of Mr Alyoshin, should all be \nrejected. For example:  \n(1) Unlawful conduct. The lynchpin of D1-2’s case on liability is that the fiduciary duties \nthey owed as officers of the Bank only applied when they were formally acting in their \ncapacity qua officer, such that any fraud they committed on the Bank by more informal \nmeans, or by the exertion of their influence on other Bank employees, could not give \nrise to any breach. Thus, on their case, members of the Management Board will have \nbreached their fiduciary duties by approving the Relevant Loans; however, D1-2, who \ninstructed the Management Board members to give that approval and who owed \nprecisely the same duties to the Bank, will evade all liability. But Ukrainian law is not \nso toothless, as the fleet of recent case law on fiduciary duties – amongst them \nUkoopspilka, Bank Daniel, Trust Bank and SFG Hermes – makes clear. D1-2’s efforts \nto suggest that violations of the CC’s prohibitions against ownership deprivation and \nabuse of rights are incapable of constituting unlawful conduct are equally \nmisconceived, and the authorities Mr Alyoshin sought to invoke in support of his \ncause in fact – as he knew full well – took precisely the opposite view. \n(2) Causation. The effort to characterise the tortious test of causation as so strict that no \ncausal link can be established between the procurer of fraud and the harm caused by \nthat fraud (“ in my view, it is … Mr Dubilet who caused the harm to the Bank and his actions \nwere unlawful, not Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov ” {Day29/119:17} - {Day29/120:2}) \nis, once again, belied by the case law which demonstrates (in a variety of different \nfactual scenarios) that a defendant may be held to have caused harm simply by failing \nto prevent third parties from wrongdoing (let alone by positively procuring the actions \nof those third parties). \n(3) Relevance of"}

Ds’ case that the misappropriation is not unlawful as a \nmatter of civil law without a criminal conviction is nonsense. The same factual \nallegations of ‘misappropriation’ may give rise both to criminal liability and civil law \nconsequences: the civil court is not precluded, by the absence of a criminal verdict, \n{AA2/15/222}\nAA2/15/22\n16 from itself “ evaluating the evidence provided by the parties ” to determine whether, quite \nindependently of any criminal offence, a defendant’s conduct was unlawful for the \npurposes of tort and/or transactions were entered into with a purpose that violates \npublic policy. Even if there were such a draconian rule (which would, of course, have \nthe effect of imposing the criminal standard of proof to a civil claim), it would be a \nprocedural rule that has no relevance here. \n23 The Repayment Defence . The Repayment Defence starts from the proposition that the \nBank did indeed suffer a US$1.9bn loss as a result of the Relevant Drawdowns. Ds then \ncontend that the loss was made good as a result of entries in the Bank’s records recording \nthe purported contractual debt under the Relevant Loans as repaid as a result of steps taken \nto cover it up (Intermediary Loans, New Loans, Transferred Assets with inflated Credit \nValues); that the Bank is bound by those book entries, even though they were made whilst \nD1-2 remained in control of the Bank; and that any tortious liability on the part of D1-2 for \nprocuring the Relevant Drawdowns is extinguished. That is a baseless and untenable \nproposition as a matter of fact and wrong as a matter of law: \n(1) D1-2 had every opportunity in 2015 and 2016 properly to make good the Bank’s loss \ncaused by the Relevant Drawdowns. They could have paid money to the Bank from \ntheir own cash resources. Had they, for example, transferred their interests in the \nFerroalloy Holding (US$1.2bn) and Georgian American Alloys (US$900m) to the \nBank in 2015 – 2016, they would be able to say that the Bank had been compensated \nfor its loss to the extent of the true value of those assets. \n(2) But of course they did not do that, and never had any intention of genuinely \ncompensating the Bank for its loss. Instead, they sought only to conceal the loss by \nprocuring the Bank to record the purported repayments of the purported balances on \nthe Relevant Loans. This was done: ( i) in 2015, through the mechanism of further \nfraudulent loans to other worthless D1-2 shell companies (the Intermediary Loans); \n(ii) in March to September 2016, by reference to the fraudulently inflated values of the \nTransferred Assets; and ( iii) in October 2016, using the mechanism of the fraudulent \nNew Loans to the New Borrowers (also shell companies with no assets and no \nprospect of repaying the loans). With the exception of the true value of the \nTransferred Assets, none of these fraudulent devices amounted to a genuine reduction \nof the Bank’s loss. \nAA2/15/23\n17 (3) The principal flaw in the Repayment Defence is that the steps taken by D1-2 in 2015 \nand 2016 to cover up the Misappropriation provided no compensation to the Bank. \nAll of the transactions which D1-2 put in place to effect the “ repayments ” (the \nIntermediary Loans, the inflated Credit Values in the Mortgages by which the \nTransferred Assets were transferred to the Bank, and the New Loans) were themselves \nfrauds.

Under Ukrainian law, the issues of the amount of loss and what amounts to \n“full compensation ” for the loss for the purposes of Art. 1166 CC are questions of fact. \nEntering further wrongful transactions (which were themselves void), under which no \ngenuine value passes in order to cover up an original prima facie  loss from a \nmisappropriation of monies, does not reduce the loss. \n(4) The Repayment Defence instead proceeds on the false premise that the Bank’s \ntortious claim against D1-2 is coterminous with the contractual or restitutionary \nliability of the Borrowers; and that the contractual or restitutionary liability is in turn \ncoterminous with the Bank’s loan ledger for the Relevant Loans. That is incorrect. \nEven if it were somehow the case that the Bank’s loan book entries recording \nrepayments of the supposed contractual debts under the Relevant Loans settled the \nBorrowers’ contractual (if the loans were valid) or restitutionary (if the loans were \nvoid) liabilities, the tort liability is manifestly different. It would only be reduced if \nthere was a true transfer of value to the Bank which really reduced the Bank’s loss. \nThe various fraudulent devices employed to cover up the Misappropriation did not \ndo that.  \n(5) The point can be illustrated by a simple example: D1-2 could have procured the Bank \nto enter into a settlement agreement with all 50 Borrowers by which the Bank accepted \nUS$5 as satisfying the Borrowers’ restitutionary liability to repay US$1.9bn extracted \nby the Relevant Drawdowns. Such a settlement agreement, even if it extinguished the \nBorrowers’ contractual or restitutionary liability, plainly would not operate to \nextinguish D1-2’s liability in tort for procuring the Relevant Drawdowns under those \npurported loans, nor would it extinguish the Bank’s US$1.9bn (less US$5) loss. The \nposition is a fortiori  where the settlement is fraudulent because the fraudsters control \nboth sides of the deal. \n(6) Lastly and for completeness, the contention that such fraudulent transactions reduced \nloss even though there is no genuine transfer of value or real reduction of loss would \nAA2/15/24\n18 also be a paradigm abuse of rights contrary to Arts. 13(2)-(3) and 16(3) CC, and would \nbe dismissed by a Ukrainian court on that basis in any event. \n24 Asset valuation . The above points apply as much to the Asset Transfer as to the fraudulent \n(Intermediary and New) Loans. To take a simple example: D1-2 procured the Stadium to be \ntransferred to the Bank with a fraudulently inflated Credit Value of UAH 1.5bn and procured \nthat value to be applied to reduce purported outstanding balances under Relevant Loans. \nBut the Stadium was only worth UAH 125m. The effect of D1-2’s conduct is that the Bank’s \nbooks record a UAH 1.5bn credit, whereas in fact the Bank still has a UAH 1.375bn loss \nwhich has not been made good (and which is disguised by the entry of the fraudulent Credit \nValue in the Bank’s books). It is absurd, and desperate, for D1-2 to contend that the Bank \nis bound by the Credit Values – fraudulently inflated values of their assets, which they \nprocured the Bank to accept. What matters is the true value. \n25 The valuation evidence is addressed at Section N , where we explain that: \n(1) In relation to the Petrol Stations, the 2016 valuations were based on fuel volume data \nthat was inflated by Chernyshov and Plyska within BOK – for example, by inflating \ndata provided by Topchy by a uniform 300%.

Indeed, an analysis of all 994 of the \nPrivat group’s petrol stations shows that D1-2 chose to transfer the least valuable \nstations to the Bank – typically those in villages with limited sales. Mr Bezant’s DCF \nis robust and incorporates appropriate RONIC and CRP figures. In contrast, Mr \nKaczmarek’s partisan approach (as we have explained) is designed to reach an absurdly \nhigh valuation – much higher than even the Credit Values – by a combination of \nunrealistic and unfairly presented assumptions and comparables.  \n(2) In relation to the OSFs, it is now clear that D1-2 decided to transfer their derelict, \ntumbleweed and economically obsolescent OSFs to the Bank. In their attempt to hide \nthis from Baker Tilly and the NBU, BOK employees came up with a series of spurious \nexplanations and ‘dog ate my homework’ excuses: “ if there are any other ideas you can also \nwrite them, and then we will discuss, well,  [sales to ] firefighters or army! ” {K6/70.02}; the OSFs \nwere not operating because of “ organisational conditions ”, “abnormal  high air temperature ”, \n“high traffic intensity of long-distance state routes ” {E14/299}. Mr Kaczmarek eventually \nadmitted doubt as to the OSFs’ operationality (“ Mr Justice Trower: It sounds like a doubt. \nA. It is a doubt, yes, my Lord ” {Day21/48:14-15}). This has forced D1 to rely on a four-\nsentence comparables ‘cross-check’ as the bedrock (or rather quicksand) of his OSF \nvaluation case, based on advertised prices for five non-comparable OSFs that had not \n{AA2/15/422}\nAA2/15/25\n19 sold for at least 13 months and which Mr Kaczmarek has in any event failed properly \nto implement. It is again rather desperate stuff and Mr Bezant’s approach of relying \non auction prices paid for some of the OSFs themselves is obviously to be preferred. \n(3) In relation to the real estate, Mr Kaczmarek did not even seek to conduct his own \nvaluations, contrary to Mann J’s 2020 CMC order, instead relying on NBU ‘verified’ \nvalues which were based on indefensible reports. By way of example, he values the \nStadium at UAH 1.5bn, even though by 2016 it could only sell 25% of its seats; was \nbanned from hosting international matches; and the Veritas report on which his \nvaluation was based fails to account for the Stadium’s obvious economic \nobsolescence. Here, once again, Mr Kaczmarek revealed his lack of independence: “ A: \n… the fact that [Veritas ] didn’t account for it could simply mean they didn’t believe any economic \nobsolescence was appropriate ” {Day22/103:4-7}. \n(4) Turning to the Aircraft, we have already explained why D1’s valuation expert’s views \nshould be rejected. But there is another point here: the experts agree that the Aircraft \nwere overvalued by at least US$76m, and they agree that the methodology used in the \n2016 Veritas report, relied upon to support the Credit Value, is “ against the accepted \nindustry practice and produces an unreliable valuation ” {D15/2/25}.  \n(5) In summary, the Court should accept the Bank’s experts’ views on all contested \nvaluation issues. The net result of this is that the Asset Transfer part of the case alone \ndemonstrates that the Bank has suffered a loss of US$594m. \nA7 A ROUTEMAP FOR THESE SUBMISSIONS  \n26 In the rest of these submissions, the Bank follows, with one exception, the same structure \nas it adopted in its written Opening Submissions.5 For convenience, the Bank outlines below \nhow these Sections fit into its claim in tort under Art. 1166 CC:  \n(1) Unlawfulness and invalidity \n27 The facts are that D1-2 procured the Misappropriation.

In particular, they used their \nownership and control of the Bank (exercised via their loyal lieutenants Dubilet, Novikov, \nGurieva, Yatsenko, etc.) (Section C and D ) and the Borrowers (exercised via PBC) ( Section \nG) to procure the Relevant Loans and Relevant Drawdowns. \n \n5  Save for Section B . In the Bank’s Opening Submissions, that section was devoted to introducing the Bank \nand the basic chronology to the Court. That is no longer necessary. In Section B of this document, we address \nthe approach to evidence in fraud claims and D2’s late Sunaltezza and Grizal disclosure. \n{AA2/15/178}\n{AA2/15/42}\n{AA2/15/88}\n{AA2/15/29}\nAA2/15/26\n20 28 Applying Ukrainian law to those facts, the Relevant Loans were shams (pursuant to Art. \n235(1) CC) and transactions contrary to public policy (pursuant to Art. 228(1) CC). They are \ntherefore void, and the Relevant Drawdowns constituted a misappropriation of the Bank’s \nfunds ( Sections I, J and M ).  \n29 D1-2 procured further documentation and transactions, the purpose of which was to \nconceal the misappropriation of the Bank’s funds under the Relevant Drawdowns. They \nused their ownership and control of the Bank, the Borrowers and D3-8 (exercised via \nPrimecap) ( Section G ) to procure ( i) the Relevant Supply Agreements and the Unreturned \nPrepayments (to give the false impression that the Relevant Loans had been granted for a \ncommercial purpose), and ( ii) the RSA and LFSA Pledges (as sham security for the Relevant \nLoans) and the Unreturned Prepayments. And they procured the creation of the Share \nPledges over companies they owned and controlled as further sham security for the Relevant \nLoans ( Section F ). As a matter of Ukrainian law, these further documents are all shams \npursuant to Art. 235 CC and transactions contrary to public policy pursuant to Art. 228 CC \nand are void ( Sections I and J ). \n30 D1-2 further sought to conceal the Misappropriation by procuring ( i) the Intermediary \nLoans and Intermediary Drawdowns to worthless shell companies they owned and \ncontrolled ( Section G and H ), (ii) the transfer of assets to the Bank at fraudulently inflated \nvalues ( Sections H and N ), and ( iii) the New Loans (again, to worthless shell companies \nthey owned and controlled) ( Section H ). The Intermediary and New Loans are shams \n(pursuant to Art. 235 CC) and transactions contrary to public policy (contrary to Art. 228(1) \nCC) and are void ( Sections I and J ). \n31 D1-2’s conduct was unlawful for the purposes of Art. 1166 CC, in that it breached Arts. \n3(1)(2), 13(1)-(2) and 92(3) CC, Art. 63 of the JSC Law, and Arts. 42 and 43 of the Law on\nBanks ( Sections I and J ). \n(2) Causation and harm \n32 D1-2’s conduct in procuring the Bank to make the Relevant Drawdowns caused the Bank \nloss in the sum of c. US$1.9bn. That is the sum of the Relevant Drawdowns (US$2.3bn) less \nthe repayment of Relevant Drawdowns by Relevant Drawdowns (US$384m under the \nBank’s Methodology). That is the sum for which the Bank claims: the Bank does not claim \nfor a percentage of each Relevant Drawdown ( Section M ). \n33 The Bank felt its loss in US dollars; alternatively, the Bank felt its loss in the currency of the \nRelevant Drawdown ( i.e. c. US$1.6bn and c.

As to that:  \n(1) The Bank’s loss is reduced to the extent of the true value of the Transferred Assets \nproperly attributable to the Relevant Drawdowns. The Bank is not bound by the \nfraudulently inflated Credit Values ascribed to those assets by D1-2; the venire contra \nfactum proprium  principle has no application (not least because it would not be \nreasonable for D1-2 to rely on values which they knew to be fraudulently inflated); \nand it would be an abuse of rights (contrary to Art. 13(2)-(3) CC) for D1-2 to seek to \nrely on those values. The true value of those assets attributable to the Relevant \nDrawdowns is c. US$89m ( Section N ), which does not include Hotel Mir (to which \nthe Bank has lost title) or the Aircraft (although the Bank does give credit for \nrepayments of principal made by Dilorsano).  \n(2) The Bank’s loss is not reduced if the Relevant Drawdowns were used, on a Funds \nFlow / Exact Matching basis, to make repayments of loans outstanding from the \nBorrowers, Intermediary Borrowers or other borrowers. The Use of Funds Defence \nshould be dismissed ( Section M5 ). \n(3) The Bank’s loss is not reduced because D1-2 procured the Bank to record the Relevant \nDrawdowns as repaid by reference to further fraudulent lending under the Relevant, \nIntermediary and/or New Loans: ( Section M4 ). \n(3) Limitation and other defences \n36 The Bank’s loss is not barred by limitation for the reasons summarised in ¶19 above and set \nout in detail in Section L1 . \n37 The Bank’s claim is not precluded by the venire contra factum proprium  principle because the \nBank has not engaged in any relevant prior inconsistent conduct; D1-2 have not reasonably \nrelied on any such allegedly inconsistent conduct to their detriment; and, in any event, the \nBank has at all times acted in good faith in the period since nationalisation with a view to \nmitigating its losses caused by Ds’ fraud ( Section L2 ). \n(4) Interest \n38 The Bank is entitled to claim compound interest as a head of loss under Ukrainian law or \npursuant to the Court’s equitable jurisdiction and should be awarded compound interest {AA2/15/222}\n{AA2/15/276}\n{AA2/15/422}\n{AA2/15/410}\n{AA2/15/396}\n{AA2/15/303}\n{AA2/15/340}\nAA2/15/28\n22 from the date of each Relevant Drawdown (or, for the sake of simplicity of calculation, from \n1.9.14) ( Section P ). To the extent the Bank’s loss was suffered in UAH and/or no \ncompound interest is available, the Bank is entitled to simple interest and inflationary losses \nunder Art. 625 CC, from the date of each Relevant Drawdown.   \n(5) Calculating the Bank’s loss \n39 Once the Court has made determination on the issues above (in particular, the currency of \nthe Bank’s loss, the value of the Transferred Assets and the Bank’s claim to interest), the \nBank will prepare a final calculation of its loss. \n• • • \nB EVIDENCE , ADVERSE INFERENCES AND VERY LATE DISCLOSURE  \n40 In this section, we set out ( i) a short summary of the approach the Court should take in \nconsidering evidence in a fraud case such as the present, and ( ii) explain the very recent (and \nincomplete) disclosure that has been dragged out of D2 since July 2023. \nB1 EVIDENCE IN FRAUD CLAIMS  \n(1) General approach \n4"}

In such cases, the Court must consider the \ncumulative effect of the material before it. As Rix LJ said in JSC BTA Bank v Ablyazov \n[2013] 1 WLR 1331 at [52] (in relation to proof of contempt to the criminal standard) \n{M1/15.1.2/26}: \n“It is, however, the essence of a successful case of circumstantial evidence that the whole is \nstronger than individual parts. It becomes a net from which there is no escape. That is why a \njury is often directed to avoid piecemeal consideration of a circumstantial case: R v Hillier  \n(2007) 233 ALR 634, cited in Archbold’s Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice , 2012 ed, para 10-\n3. Or, as Lord Simon of Glaisdale put it in R v Kilbourne  [1973] AC 729, 758, ‘ Circumstantial \n \n6  Grant & Mumford, Civil Fraud (1st ed.) at ¶34-072: “[ i]n proving fraud or dishonesty, it is usually necessary to persuade \nthe court to draw inferences from primary facts; direct evidence of fraud is relatively rare ” {M1/33.2/2}; Lakatamia Shipping \nCo Ltd v Su [2021] EWHC 1907 (Comm) at [59] per Bryan J: “ the case is likely to be an inferential one based on the \ncumulative evidential picture, much of which is likely to consist of circumstantial evidence ” {M1/23.2/16}. \n{AA2/15/500}\n{AA2/15/132}\nAA2/15/29\n23 evidence … works by cumulatively, in geometrical progression, eliminating other possibilities ’. The matter is \nwell put by Dawson J in Shepherd v The Queen  (1990) 170 CLR 573, 579-580 (but also passim ):  \n‘the prosecution bears the burden of proving all the elements of the crime beyond \nreasonable doubt. That means that the essential ingredients of each element must be so \nproved. It does not mean that every fact – every piece of evidence – relied upon to prove \nan element by inference must itself be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Intent, for \nexample, is, save for statutory exceptions, an element of every crime. It is something \nwhich, apart from admissions, must be proved by inference. But the jury may quite \nproperly draw the necessary inference having regard to the whole of the evidence, whether \nor not each individual piece of evidence relied upon is proved beyond reasonable doubt, \nprovided they reach their conclusion upon the criminal standard of proof. Indeed, the \nprobative force of a mass of evidence may be cumulative, making it pointless to consider \nthe degree of probability of each item of evidence separately.’”  \n43 Rix LJ’s reasoning has frequently been cited in other (civil) fraud cases. See, for example:  \n(1) Kazakhstan Kagazy Plc v Zhunus [2017] EWHC 3374 (Comm) at [159] per Picken J \n{M1/18.2.1/78}:  “[i]t is also to be borne in mind that it is perfectly legitimate for the Court to \nproceed by way of inference from circumstantial evidence ”.  \n(2) Kekhman at [79] per Bryan J {M1/18.3/59}: “ the points that are made [by Rix LJ ] that it \nis the essence of a successful circumstantial case that the whole is stronger than the individual parts"}

And at [65] - [66] {M1/23.2/18-19}: \n“65. In this regard, and consistently with Rix LJ’s observations, in evaluating the \nevidence it is best to avoid compartmentalising particular points relied upon, or treating \npoints in ‘silos’, or adopting a piecemeal approach to evidence relied upon; rather it is \nappropriate to take account of “ previous findings in considering the likelihood of the later facts \nhaving occurred ” or, in other words, to “ stand ... back and consider ... the effects of the implications \nof the facts ... found in the round ” (see Bank St Petersburg PJSC v Arkhangelsky  [2020] [EWCA] \nCiv 408; [2020] 4 W.L.R. 55 at [70] [ sc. 59] per Sir Geoffrey Vos C).  \n66. Equally, in deciding whether a serious allegation is established on the balance of \nprobabilities, regard may be had to the fact that a party has lied or otherwise engaged \nin misconduct in other respects - see Fiona Trust & Holding Corp v.

There can be no serious dispute that, applying those \nprinciples, adverse inferences should be drawn in this case: \n(1) The missing witnesses – D1, D2 and their associates and nominees, as well as the \npurported owners of D3-8 – all plainly have central evidence to give on every factual \naspect of this claim.  \n(2) No attempt has been made to advance a case that there was any impediment to any \nof them giving evidence. There was none. \n(3) Their absence is a strategic decision that it is preferable for Ds and their witnesses to \nstay silent than to come to Court and to confirm that D1-2 controlled the Bank, owned \nthe Relevant Entities ( i.e. the Borrowers, the Intermediary Borrowers, D3-8, the \nAlleged Principals and the New Borrowers), and procured the Misappropriation. \nThere can be no more compelling case for adverse inferences than that. \n45 This is also a case in which the Court should draw an adverse inference against D1 and D2 \nfor their serious and culpable failure to give proper disclosure and to fulfil their disclosure \nobligations.7 The need to do so is underscored by D2’s attempts to rely on a lack of messages, \ncommunications or documents as being indicative of evidential gaps in the Bank’s case \n(‘absence of evidence is evidence of absence’): D2 Opening/¶¶82-83 {AA4/1/34}.  \n46 D1 has remained characteristically silent on this point, while D2 complains that “ there is no \nevidence that [D2] deliberately destroyed documents in anticipation of litigation ” and that allegations of \nbreaches of litigation holds and deliberate destruction of documents are unjustified (D2 \n"}

The position in which \nthe Court now finds itself, largely bereft of documents from D1-2’s personal sources \n(and those of their close associates Novikov, Dubilet, Gurieva and Melnyk), is a \ndeliberate situation of their own making. D2’s raft of allegedly innocent explanations \nfor the near-complete absence of documents from his personal sources – charitable \ngiving of iPhones and amnesia in respect of passwords for email accounts, the \nexistence of email addresses and the use of iCloud – should be rejected. The Court is \ninvited to find that, when the opportunity to do so arose, D1 and D2 ensured that \nthey got rid of records which would implicate them in the Misappropriation. \n(3) More importantly, adverse inferences are merited not just when there has been \ndeliberate document destruction (as is the case in respect of both D1 and D2), but \nalso because of the flagrant breaches of D1-2’s disclosure obligations: \n(a) We enumerated the plethora of disclosure orders that the Court was required to \nmake in Bank Opening/Sch. 1 {AA2/2/2}. Even in a case of this complexity, \nthe Bank should not have been required to make so many (successful) disclosure \napplications to squeeze documents out of D1 and D2.  \n(b) The Court has also seen evidence of D1-2’s self-serving approach to ( i) \ndisclosure (failure to identify PBC/Grizal/Sunaltezza as custodians; the \nbelatedly disclosed IK Volume Spreadsheets; and D2’s reliance on the Deeds of \nIndemnity and Waiver without disclosure, as required by the Court, of \ndocuments relating to their execution), and ( ii) redactions (the WhatsApp saga; \nthe inappropriate redaction of the purported UBOs of the Emmet Group). \n(c) D1’s approach in relation to e.g. Primecap disclosure has already been criticised \nby the Court as being “ akin to squeezing blood out of a stone ” and “ far removed from \ncompliance with [D1’s] obligations to co-operate with the court in furthering the overriding \nobjective ” {A5/27/13} (¶42). This was a joint exercise on behalf of both D1 and \nD2, paid for equally by both of them, for which D2 cannot absolve himself of \nresponsibility. \n(d) But if D1’s approach has been lamentable for the glacial pace at which it \nadvanced and the"}

This was a joint exercise on behalf of both D1 and \nD2, paid for equally by both of them, for which D2 cannot absolve himself of \nresponsibility. \n(d) But if D1’s approach has been lamentable for the glacial pace at which it \nadvanced and the lengths to which the Bank was required to go to obtain \ndisclosure, D2’s merits even more trenchant criticism. It is only by chance – in \nAA2/15/32\n26 the context of the Bank’s Dadourian application – that it has come to light that \nhis wholly-owned companies employed and paid large sums to 11 PBC \nnominees and five former Bank employees. We address this in Section B2  \nbelow.  \n47 The Court is therefore invited to draw the following inferences against D1-8: \nInferences from missing witnesses \n(1) D1 decided to withdraw his witness statement and the evidence of his proposed \nwitnesses because they would have confirmed that D1-2 controlled the Bank, owned \nand controlled all of the Relevant Entities, and procured the Misappropriation. \n(2) D2 decided to withdraw his trial witness statements for the same reason. \n(3) D1 and D2 decided not to obtain a witness statement from Dubilet, Novikov, \nGurieva, Melnyk, Kazantsev, Koryak, and Markova, for the same reason. \n(4) D3-8 decided not to obtain a witness statement from any of their current or former \nofficers and current or former nominee UBOs because such evidence would have \nconfirmed that each of D3-8 was knowingly involved in the Misappropriation and that \nD3-8 were ultimately owned and controlled by D1-2.  \nInferences from document destruction and disclosure failures \n(5) D1-2 sought to minimise their use of communications which left records (by avoiding \nemail, in D1’s case, and by their use of the ‘Black’). But where such records existed, \nD1 and D2 gave false disclosure evidence/statements, got rid of devices, and deleted \ndocuments and records to conceal their involvement in the Misappropriation. \n(6) Even where documents have not been deleted, D1-2’s approach to their disclosure \nevidence/statements, document searches and collections has been manifestly deficient \nand resulted in the withholding of documents which are adverse to their case (from \ntheir own sources and from key individuals such as Novikov, Melnyk, Dubilet, \nGurieva and Yatsenko). \n(7) D1-2 acted in the manner described in (5) - (6) above because, had further disclosure \nbeen given, it would have reinforced the case that they controlled the Bank, owned \nand controlled all of the Relevant Entities, and instigated and knew all about the \nMisappropriation. \n{AA2/15/34}\nAA2/15/33\n27 B2 GRIZAL / SUNALTEZZA  \n48 We describe the sorry story of D2’s disclosure of Grizal/Sunaltezza material in the Bank’s \nNote dated 28.9.23 {AA2/14/2-6}.

We return to D2’s disclosure breaches \nbelow. First, however, we explain what has emerged over the past three months.  \n(1) Grizal/Sunaltezza bank statements and employment records \n49 The bank statements and employment records that D2 has disclosed show three things. \n50 First, that 10 PBC nominees were employed by Sunaltezza from 1.11.17 (with a further PBC \nnominee, Ivlev, employed from 6.3.19).

They, together with D2’s Part 18 response dated \n10.10.23 {L/238.2}, demonstrate that D2 liaised closely with D1, Anischenko, Novikov and \nMarkova from 20.12.16 about Grizal, Sunaltezza and his new employees. We refer to much \nof that material below. But for now, we draw attention to the following documents. \n(1) Two days after nationalisation. On 20.12.16 ( i.e. two days after the decision was taken \nto nationalise the Bank), D2 and Anischenko exchanged emails about how to make \ncertain modest payments which would previously have been made via the Bank’s \nCyprus branch. They conclude that the payments would need to be routed via an \naccount with a Latvian bank. And then D2 says this: \n“Explain everything to Markova. They will offer an option. CB [ sc. the Cyprus Branch] is \ndone. She is now in Primec[a]p.” \nD2 email to Anischenko on 20.12.16 {K8-D/1}  \nThis demonstrates two critical points: ( i) the fact that a Bank employee began to work \nfor Primecap within two days of nationalisation is further damning evidence that D1-\n2 were Primecap’s true owners and controllers; and ( ii) the fact that D2 knows all \nabout this shows just how closely involved he was with the minutiae of the \nadministration of the D1-2 asset empire, and gives a lie to his assertions to the \ncontrary. \n(2) Late 2016/early 2017.

In “ about late 2016/early 2017 ”, D1 (or perhaps Novikov on his \nbehalf) apparently had a conservation with D2 during which he asked for the \nSunaltezza employment arrangements in relation to the 10 PBC nominees employed \nfrom 1.11.17 to be put in place. D2 cannot recall the words used or whether there \nwere any further discussions: see Enyo’s letters of 23.9.23 {L/210}, 29.9.23 {L/218} \nand 10.10.23 {L/238.2}.10 But D2 maintains (and these are yet more lies) that ( i) he \n \n9  The other agreements are in similar terms: see, e.g., Pereviznyi’s contracts at {K8-B2/39}, {K8-B2/40}, {K8-\nB2/41}, {K8-B2/42}, {K8-B2/43}. The main differences relate to the “ Employees’ Duties ” as set out in section \n2 of the contracts. \n10  For his part, D1 has refused to provide any further information {L/238.3} {L/259.2} {L/263}. \nAA2/15/37\n31 had no idea of which individuals would become Sunaltezza’s employees; and ( ii) (as a \nresult) did not know that Sunaltezza should be a custodian when preparing his DRD.  \n(3) 11.2.19. On this date, D2 signed page three of a “ Review Form – Legal Entities ” which \nhad been prepared by Eurobank (as well as initialling pp. 1 – 2) {K8-D/20}. It \ncontained a list of 24 people to whom Grizal had made payments in the last 12 \nmonths. Importantly, the list includes: \n(a) Nine former PBC staff: Dubovska, Hayvoronska, Kravchenko, Melnyk, \nPereviznyi, Ryazantseva, Velk, Viktorovskyi and Yesipova. \n(b) Two former Bank staff: Markova and Synetkovskyy. \nSimilar documents were signed by D2 on 16.10.17 (which listed two former Bank \nstaff, Markova and Morgachov, as payees of Grizal): {K8-D/12}. \n(4) 2017-2022. D2 is closely involved with Sunaltezza. For example: \n(a) On 27.6.18, Novikov sent D2 a WhatsApp message saying: “ So I believe that it [sc. \na sum of money, probably €450,000 ] can be transferred to Sunaltezza – the funds are \nsufficient ” {K5-A2/15/7}. \n(b) On 8.10.18, Novikov and D2 had the following WhatsApp exchange:  \nNovikov “Good afternoon! Do we need to give you the budget for  \n  Sunaltezza for October-December 2018 (if MM hasn’t given it to \n  you already)?” \nD2  “I confirmed [ sc. the budget]” \nNovikov “Merci!” \nD2/Novikov exchange on 8.10.18 {K5-A2/15/22}  \n(c) D2 signed bank documentation and signed / approved documents relating to \nthe financial statements for Grizal and Sunaltezza in October 2017 {K8-D/12}, \nDecember 2017 {K8-D/14}, February 2019 {K8-D/20}, July 2020 {K8-\nD/39.7}, January 2021 {K8-D/41} and October 2021 {K8-E/6}. \n(d) D2 sent and received regular updates as to Grizal and/or Sunaltezza’s bank \nbalances (or monies transferred or received) from 17.10.17 onwards {K5-\nA3/5/134}. For example, on 17.8.20, Anischenko sent the following WhatsApp \nmessage to D2: \nAA2/15/38\n32 Anischenko: “Dear Gennadiy …, Grizal’s balance is €1.242k, $35k, £63k. For a \nquarter, [ redacted ] is needed. Also for Sunaltezza, €50k is needed for August, and \n€40k for September [ redacted ].” \nAnischenko updating D2 on 17.8.20 {K5-A3/5/530}  \nIndeed, on 14.1.20, D2 updates Anischenko, saying: \nD2: “462 thousand euros Grizal to Sunaltezza, financing for Q1 2020. Balance of \nGrizal at Eurobank: 1,268 € + 525k $” \nD2 updating Anischenko on Sunaltezza on 14.1.20 {K5-A3/5/502}  \nAnd on 2.10.20, D2 and Markova had the following exchange: \nMarkova: “Good afternoon. EUR 254k Grizal to Sunaltezza funding for Q4 \n2020” \nD2: “OK” \nD2/Markova exchange about Sunaltezza funding on 2.10.20 {K5-A2/14/2}  \n(3) Key points  \n54 Standing back from this latest disclosure omnishambles, the r"}

Strikingly: \n(a) The 11 PBC nominees who became formally employed by Sunaltezza between \nthem are purported UBOs of 34 Borrowers and 23 Intermediary Borrowers: see \nAppendix B1 . \n(b) Either the PBC nominees (save Ivlev) were moved in the aftermath of \nnationalisation (if D2 has correctly dated his conversation with D1/Novikov) \nor they were moved in c. October 2017 (their employment contracts start from \nNovember 2017, at the time D1 and D2 were taking steps in anticipation of the \nBank issuing proceedings against them). Either way, D1-2 obviously thought \nthat things were getting too hot in Ukraine for their key nominees to stay there; \nand so they relocated those who were prepared to move to Cyprus. \n(c) This late disclosure therefore provides powerful evidence to support the Bank’s \ncase that the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers were D1-2’s companies. \n(2) The disclosure shows D2 employing three of the five purported UBOs of D3-5 – \nMelnyk, Yesipova and Ivlev – and one of the UBOs of Collard (the Alleged Principal \n{AA2/16}\nAA2/15/39\n33 of D6) – Ryazantseva. Again, this is powerful evidence that D1-2 are the true \nbeneficial owners of these companies. \n(3) The disclosure further undermines D2’s suggestions that he tried to step away from \nthe Bank from July 2014, and that he tried to distance himself from D1 from 2007 \n(“Whilst  [D1] and I were the closest of that initial group, since around 2007 when I moved aboard, \nwe have tended towards our own individual projects ” {B2/11/4}). Why, if the former point \nwas true, did he employ a string of former Cyprus branch employees in the year \nfollowing nationalisation? And why, if the latter was correct, did he agree with D1 in \na remarkably informal way that he would take and pay on many of the most important \nmembers of PBC’s staff?  \n(4) The disclosure provides further compelling evidence of D1-2’s ownership of \nPrimecap, switching Markova from the Bank’s Cypriot branch on 18.12.16 to \nPrimecap on 20.12.16 (D2: “ Explain everything to Markova. … She is now in Primec [a]p.”). \nD2’s up-to-date knowledge of events on the ground – and indeed his receipt of regular \nbalance updates and budgets – stands in stark contrast to the hands-off, disengaged, \nforgetful homme d’affaires  that he seeks to present to the Court. And the salaried \nemployment of 10 PBC nominees by D2 via Sunaltezza from 2017 is also powerful \nevidence from which it is to be inferred that D1-2 owned and/or controlled PBC, and \nthat its employees acted on their instructions, prior to the Bank’s nationalisation. \n(5) The Court has already seen how D6-8 were funded by Sanderlyn and Versala (more \nD1-2 companies). D2 has sought to distance himself from the 2019 messages from \nMarkova to D1 providing near-daily updates on Sanderlyn and Versala’s bank balances \n(D2 Opening/Table5(9) {AA4/1/75}, e.g. “[t]he Bank seeks to elide the positions of [D2] \nand [D1]”). The new documents give the lie to that: we now know that Markova was \nactually employed and paid by D2 when she was messaging D1 about Sanderlyn and \nVersala’s bank balances in 2019.

Indeed, they also show that two other Sunaltezza \nemployees – Diachenko and Pyrog (see Appendix B1 ) – were the authorised users of \nSanderlyn’s internet banking facilities {K8-E/5/3}. \n(6) The new documents expose brazen lies by D1-2 in their Defences and RFI responses:  \n(a) D2 pleads at ¶18C(3)(a) of his Defence that “ Mr Bogolyubov is not acquainted with \nany of the individuals identified in Schedule 6 to the Particulars of Claim …. ” {A1/18/9} \n(see to similar effect D2Def/¶18C(3)(b)(ii), and Bogolyubov4/¶144 \n{B2/11/36}). In fact, it is now clear that D2 (through his wholly owned service \n{AA2/16}\nAA2/15/40\n34 company) employed and paid nine of those individuals between 2017-2019: \nYesipova {A1/7.1/4}; Kravchenko {A1/7.1/13}; Ryazantseva {A1/7.1/17}; \nMelnyk {A1/7.1/18}; Viktorovskyi {A1/7.1/21}; Hayvoronska {A1/7.1/23}; \nPereviznyi {A1/7.1/24}; Burkhan {A1/7.1/27}; and Velk {A1/7.1/28}.11  \n(b) D2 had to answer RFI requests to the best of his knowledge having made “ all \nreasonable enquiries of his professional advisers ” {A2/34/2} ( ¶4) {A2/39}. Despite \nemploying the 11 PBC nominees via Sunaltezza, D2 ( i) made a series of non-\nadmissions as to the positions those individuals held at his admitted companies \n(e.g. “no admission is made as to whether Ms Kravchenko was a director of Borrower LLC \nAlfatrader or a member of the supervisory board of KSW ” {A2/39/7} (¶3(j)); and ( ii) \nidentified five of those 11 as the “ other UBOs ” of the Borrowers in which he had \nadmitted an interest {A2/34/3} (¶5). The former non-admissions were \nnonsense in circumstances in which D2 employed the relevant individuals; the \nlatter plea was a lie – D2 knew full well that his full-time employees were not \nco-beneficial owners of the Borrowers. \n(7) The new documents expose further lies by D2 in response to the Bank’s disclosure \napplication dated 16.11.22 by which the Bank sought an order, inter alia , that D2 use \nhis best endeavours to access and search Melnyk’s devices, email accounts and mobile \ntelephones used in the period 1.1.13 – 31.12.19 for documents sent, received or \nproduced on behalf of D2 {G1/76}. D2 resisted that application on the basis that he \nhas “ no right to access and search [Melnyk’s ] devices, accounts and telephones ” and “ Melnyk did \nnot act on Mr Bogolyubov’s behalf outside the course of his employment at PBC ” (Elliss5/¶¶25, \n53 {H3/22/6}, emphasis added). In fact, from November 2017 to at least 1.1.20 \nMelnyk was an employee of D2’s Sunaltezza and provided corporate services to D2 \ncompanies. \n(8) By ¶6.1 of the Court’s order dated 26.1.23, D2 was required to contact Markova to \nassist with his provision of information which the Court had decided was necessary \nfor the Bank to police the WFO {A6/109/5}. Just over a month later, on 28.2.23, D2 \nfiled evidence which explained that he had contacted Markova but that “ I have not, as \n \n11  D2 repeated that untruth most recently on 28.2.23 (before disclosure of the Grizal and Sunaltezza bank \nstatements): Bogolyubov6/¶7.2 “ I do not know the details of when the oral agreements were entered into, or what their terms \nare. There are many individuals who are said in my asset disclosure to have oral agreements with me that I do not recall having \nmet or heard of prior to the Proceedings being issued. In light of the above, the ‘reasonable enquiries’ that I myself have been able \nto make are limited. … ” {H3/23/2-3} (¶¶7.2, 8).

That is, frankly, an outrage: \nMarkova was D2’s employee; and D2’s Sunaltezza paid Markova’s fortnightly salary \nof €3,350 on 13.12.22, 11.1.23, 25.1.23, 17.2.23 and 23.2.23 (along with a €10,050 \nbonus on 28.12.22, and expenses of €429.84, €423.44 and €405.74 on 9.12.22, 17.1.23 \nand 9.2.23). If Markova was not responding to D2, that was because she was told not \nto. To add insult to contempt, D2’s 31.7.23 table of “ corrections ” cavils at the Bank’s \nsuggestion that D2 had said that Markova was “ able to assist in relation to his asset \nstructures ”. His correction reads thus: “ D2 was ordered to contact Ms Markova, pursuant to \nthe Bank’s submission that she administered his assets ” {AA6/19/19} (original emphasis).12 \nD2’s lawyers could never have made that point had D2 told them that Markova was \nin fact one of his employees, working a minimum of 50 hours a week administering \nhis assets, and being paid €7,500 per month to do so (plus bonuses and expenses). \n(9) The documents are a yet further example of D2’s regrettable approach to compliance \nwith his disclosure obligations. The Grizal and Sunaltezza bank statements are plainly \nadverse documents to D2’s case which were and are within his control. Ditto the \nWhatsApp messages and emails that have slowly emerged ( e.g. “Explain everything to \nMarkova. … She is now in Primec [a]p”). He was under a duty to disclose them as known \nadverse documents13 or pursuant to his Model E disclosure obligations. But for the \nBank’s 17.3.23 application to force D2 to disclose further details of his income (in \norder properly to police the WFO), the trial would have concluded without the Bank \nor the Court having any idea that this key material existed. \n• • • \nC D1, D2 AND THEIR ASSOCIATES  \n55 This section provides a fuller account of D1-2, and of their relationship with one another \nand with the trusted associates who managed their sprawling and jointly owned business \ninterests.

They were both directly involved in putting these nominee \narrangements in place and maintaining them.  \n(4) There is no dispute that the Relevant and Intermediary Loans, Relevant Drawdowns, \nIntermediary Drawdowns, Relevant Supply Agreements and Unreturned Prepayments \nwere arranged by individuals at BOK, Primecap and PBC. Given the foregoing, the \noverwhelming inference is that the Misappropriation was procured by D1 and D2 and \nfor their benefit. The notion that these individuals at the Bank, PBC and Primecap \nwere on a frolic of their own is risible. \nC1 D1 AND D2 \n57 D1 and D2 are introduced at Bank Opening/¶¶56-64 {AA2/1/30-32}. It is unnecessary to \nrepeat or expand upon the points made there.  \n(1) D1-2’s joint business empire and close relationship  \n58 Friends and business partners. D1-2 have been close friends and business partners for over \n30 years: see Bank Opening/¶¶63-64 {AA2/2/31-32}.  \n59 Joint assets. D2 has sought to distance himself from D1 in this litigation. For instance, his \nabandoned trial evidence was that “[ w]hilst [D1] and I were closest of that initial group, since around \n2007 when I moved aboard, we have tended towards our own individual projects ” {B2/11/4} (¶12); and \nhis Opening Submissions said that “[ D1] and [D2] had a long-standing friendship and business \n{AA2/15/43}\n{AA2/15/56}\n{AA2/15/74}\n{AA2/15/80}\n{AA2/15/87}\nAA2/15/43\n37 relationship, sometimes investing alongside one another (e.g. in relation to Ukranafta and Nikopol); however, \nthey were not business ‘partners’ in any legal sense and acted independently ” {AA4/1/49} (¶132) \n(emphasis added). This suggestion of a parting of ways is simply false: D1 and D2 continue \nto hold identical or near-identical interests in virtually all of their most valuable companies; \nand act anything but independently. \n60 A table listing D1-2’s 50 most valuable joint assets (which, according to their estimates, had \na total value exceeding US$8bn) was handed up on Day 17 and is found at {AA6/17/11-\n16}. As that table demonstrates, the vast majority of D1-2’s wealth is – and was in 2018 \nwhen their asset disclosure was provided – held 50/50. Often, D1-2 hold a 100% interest in \nthe relevant company; where this is not so, D1-2 typically have identical interests. It is simply \nincorrect that D1-2 only “ sometimes ” invest “ alongside one another ”. \n61 There is a further point here, arising from the Byzantine structures through which D1-2 hold \ntheir assets. When the detail of those structures is analysed, it demonstrates that:  \n(1) According to their WFO Asset Disclosure, D1-2 used more than 200 of the same \noffshore holding companies to hold their assets as at December 2017: see Appendix \nC1. \n(2) D1 and D2 also used 21 of the same PBC employees, the same former Bank employee \n(Artem Zamsha), and eight of the same Primecap employees, to hold their assets \npursuant to oral agreements.

The counterparties to those oral agreements are listed at \n{AA6/11} (D1) and {H1/82} (D2). \n62 Litigation. D1-2 have been embroiled in civil litigation, often in this jurisdiction and usually \nas co-defendants, for well over a decade: Bank Opening/¶70 {AA2/1/35}. Though \nseparately represented, they have never sought to blame one another for their legal woes or \nbring contribution or indemnity proceedings against each other, including in the present \nproceedings, notwithstanding the alleged existence of the “ indemnity ” in D2’s favour. Indeed: \n(1) In the Pinchuk Proceedings, D2 used two members of D1’s counsel team in these \nproceedings (as well as D1’s Ukrainian law expert, Mr Alyoshin, whom he instructed \njointly with D1) and accepted that – if D1 was liable – he was jointly and severally \nliable too: {I3/4/4}{I3/4/19} (¶12(a) and 73). \n(2) In the Tatneft Proceedings, D2 offered to pay US$133m into Court and provide first \ncharges over his £67m London properties to secure the discharge of the WFO \n{AA2/17}\nAA2/15/44\n38 {I3/39.5/12-13}. D2 made this offer in November 2017 “ with the consent of, and for the \nbenefit of, all Respondents ” {I3/39.5/4}.14  \n(2) D1-2’s means of communication \n63 D1 does not use email. Instead, D1-2 communicate by ( i) face-to-face discussions, ( ii) mobile \ntelephone calls (including via WhatsApp), ( iii) the ‘Black’, and ( iv) instant messaging ( e.g. \nWhatsApp). Besides a fragment of D2’s mobile phone call logs from February to May 2014,15 \nno records of communication between D1 and D2 during the period of the \nMisappropriation have been disclosed. In failing to give proper disclosure or oral evidence \nat trial, they have failed to provide the Court with any evidence on the true nature and extent \nof their cooperation at this crucial time. But it is clear from their post-nationalisation \nWhatsApp messages16 that they communicated frequently on a wide range of topics \n– including their assets and the business of their Bank – and reserved substantive discussion \nof sensitive matters to oral communication: their messages primarily arrange calls and \nmeetings, and share short snippets of information, documents and press articles. The oblique \nmessages – and volume of missed calls – surrounding many of these snippets makes clear \nthat oral communication took place regularly, in parallel.17 \n64 Face-to-face discussions. Neither D1 nor D2 has disclosed a calendar, a schedule of \nmeetings, or records from their offices or diaries, although businessmen of their stature must \nhave had some way of keeping track of who they were meeting, where and when. But it is \nundeniable that D1-2 held regular had face-to-face discussions, taking place at: \n(1) Their Geneva office. A second ‘Black’ directory disclosed by D2 {K5-E/3}, which \ndates from around April 2017,18 includes various references to a “ new office ” in Geneva. \nD1 and D2 both have extension numbers for “ Geneva work, new office ”, complete with \nthree conference rooms and a “ directorial room ” {K5-E/3.1/1-2}. The Court should \ninfer that D1-2 established a shared office in Geneva in around 2016.  \n \n14  D2 was the First Respondent to the Tatneft WFO; D1 was the Second Respondent; and the Third and Fourth \nRespondents were alleged to be associates “ closely involved with aspects of Privat’s business ” {I3/25/2} (¶6).

In addition to the Geneva office, D1 and D2 both had, \nand appear still to have, offices in Dnipro and Kyiv (see their respective disclosure \ncertificates at {A4/22/16-18} and {A4/32/5}); D1 also had apartments in Kyiv and \nDnipro {A4/22/12-13}; and both had homes on the lakefront in the village of \nNikolskoye-on-Dnieper, 50km from Dnipro: {K5-E/2.1/1-2}. They continued to \nmeet in shared offices after D2 says he left Geneva in Autumn 2018: see “ Are you \npicking me up? ” (D2 to D1, 8.7.18 {K5-A2/3/43}); “ I will go to the office ” (D1 to D2, \n5.11.18 {K5-A2/3/58}); “ Will you pick me up tomorrow? ” (D2 to D1, 8.12.18 {K5-\nA2/3/95}); “ At 5pm meeting in the office ” (D1 to D2, 13.1.19 {K5-A2/4/2});  “Will you \nbe in the office ” (D2 to D1, 8.3.19 {K5-A2/4/19}). \n(3) When they were socialising together ( e.g. when they were holidaying together with their \nfamilies, perhaps on D2’s Lauren L or Sirocco yachts {J3/4/9}; when they ate \ntogether {K5-A2/7/12};19 or when they went to basketball games together {K5-\nA2/10/16}). \n65 Mobile telephone calls. D2 has disclosed a set of pre-nationalisation call records for an old \nmobile phone, but only for the period February to May 2014 ({K5-E/4} - {K5-E/7}: he \nclaims not to have access to any call records before or after this period, other than for the \nperiod December 2016 to January 2017 {L/69.0001/1} (¶2)). The 2014 records show that, \nin this four-month period alone, D2 had 156 calls with D1. This limited window into D1-\n2’s pattern of calls is consistent with the impression given by their WhatsApp messages that \nthey were in regular oral communication. \n66 Aside from that, all that the Court has to go on is the number of missed calls between D1 \nand D2, which do show up on the WhatsApp chat transcripts (calls that took place do not): \n(1) Chats disclosed by D2 show that there were 315 missed calls from D1 to D2 between \n4.7.17 and 31.12.19, and 103 in the course of 2020. These figures do not include \nmissed calls from D2 to D1 (which do not show up in D2’s WhatsApp logs). D1’s \ndisclosed WhatsApp logs show that D2 made 304 missed calls to D1 from 23.12.17 \nto 11.9.19. The Bank can therefore demonstrate that there were 722 missed calls \nbetween 4.7.17 and 31.12.20. See further Appendix C2 . \n \n19  For further examples, see {K5-A2/4/2}, {K5-A2/4/8}, {K5-A2/10/6}, {K5-A2/3/100}.  \n{AA2/17/8}\nAA2/15/46\n40 (2) A good example is the period leading up to the institution of these proceedings.

D1 and D2 used the ‘Black’ secure phone system to discuss their affairs: \n(1) That is evident from their instant messages, which include overt references to the use \nof this system – D2 says to D1: “ Going to chorny [Black ]” (27.12.17), “ Call me on black ” \n(21.9.18), “ Let’s talk on the protected line ” (12.5.19) and “ I’ll be at 0370 [one of D2’s extension \nnumbers on the ‘Black’ ]” (17.2.21) – see the Bank’s hand-up at {AA6/17/3-4}. \n(2) It is an obvious inference from the existence of the ‘Black’ directory and the number \nof extensions D1-2 have on it. The 2013 version of the directory {K5-E/2.1} \ncontains:  \n \n20  D1 has only disclosed two chains of WhatsApp messages during such period: 11 messages in the period 4.1.16 \n– 29.2.16 (which had been deleted in their entirety and had to be recovered) {K5-A1/6} and 14 messages in \nthe period 20.10.15 – 9.8.16 {K5-A1/5}. The next chain disclosed by D1 with D2 does not start until 23.12.17, \nnearly 16 months later {K5-A1/7}. \n21  Given the timing, and the fact that D1 was simultaneously messaging Granovsky and Viktor Barsuk expressly \nabout the ongoing Supervisory Board meeting (see {K5-A1/23/18} and {K5-A1/2/11}), the subject of \ndiscussion between D1 and D2 must have been the Bank’s claim. \n22  {K5-A4/2/19}. \nAA2/15/47\n41 (a) Eight extensions for D2: one on his yacht Sirocco, two on this other yacht \nLauren L, one in Nikolskoe, two in London offices, one in a Kyiv office and \none in an office in Dnipro; and  \n(b) Eleven extensions for D1: three in Geneva (all office-based), two in Olby, and \none in each of Herzlia, Nikolskoe, Yalta, Dnipro, Kyiv and Odessa. \n(3) D1 and D2 were plainly the primary intended users of the ‘Black’ system: their Dnipro \noffices were allocated the numbers 0101 and 0102 respectively.  \n68 WhatsApp. D1 has disclosed just 25 messages with D2 pre-dating nationalisation (the first \nof which is from 20.10.15, i.e. after the period of the Misappropriation, and some of which \nhad to be recovered after they were initially deleted by D1: {K5-A1/6}). D2 has disclosed \nno such messages: he says he has disposed of his pre-nationalisation devices, as to which the \nadverse inferences explained in Section  B1(2)  (¶47) should be drawn. \n69 But D1-2 have disclosed 2,434 messages they exchanged between 4.7.17 and 26.5.21 , \ntogether with 928 attachments (average: 624 messages and 238 attachments per year). The \nmajority of these messages share articles and documents with no or little context, pass on \nsnippets of information, offer only cryptic comments or constitute bare requests to talk or \nmeet. But a close analysis of the D1-2 WhatsApp messages also reveals that: \n(1) There was, and remains, an extremely close personal relationship between the two \nmen.

The \nmajority of these messages share articles and documents with no or little context, pass on \nsnippets of information, offer only cryptic comments or constitute bare requests to talk or \nmeet. But a close analysis of the D1-2 WhatsApp messages also reveals that: \n(1) There was, and remains, an extremely close personal relationship between the two \nmen. D1-2 communicate very informally, sharing jokes and often bawdy memes, along \nwith health and reading recommendations: see Bank Opening/¶69(1) {AA2/1/33}. \n(2) D2 is no silent or absent partner in the D1/2 relationship: ( i) he is fully apprised of \nwhat is going on; ( ii) he is frequently provided with information or documentation \nthat has been obtained illegitimately (and expresses no concern or surprise); ( iii) he \nsometimes tells D1 (not) to do certain things;23 and ( iv) he regularly provides D1 with \npress articles and advice about issues relating to the Bank, the NBU and banking \nreform in Ukraine. We address these points at (3)-(4) below and in Appendix C3 .  \n \n23  e.g. “We need to invite Kamenchuk ” {K5-A2/3/35}; “ Don’t say anything about the USB stick ” {K5-A2/3/36}; “ I think \nwe need to adjust ” {K5-A2/3/98}; “ This is not needed at Inter. Better to be quiet … Will break the game ” {K5-A2/4/12}; \n“Did you call the Dubilets for Tuesday. It would be good for me to be present. ” {K5-A2/5/32}; “ Why do we need this? To \npull chestnuts out of the fire for someone. And add enemies? ” {K5-A2/5/39}). \n{AA2/15/30}\n{AA2/17/11}\nAA2/15/48\n42 (3) Communications relating to this claim \n70 D1-2 continued to cooperate closely about the Bank in the aftermath of the Bank’s \nnationalisation, including  by sharing leaked and confidential material with each other: \n(1) In a series of WhatsApp messages in late 2017, D1 sent D2 documents or information \nrelating to D1’s attempts to thwart the Bank bringing these claims: ( i) on 2.12.17, D1 \nprovided D2 with the text of a draft injunction that he was going to seek against Hogan \nLovells a matter of weeks before this claim was brought {K5-A2/3/16} {K5-C1/28}; \n(ii) on 7.12.17, D1 provided D2 with a court order obtained by the Ukrainian General \nProsecutor authorising a search of the Bank’s premises, together with the locations of \nimportant Bank personnel ( e.g. its CEO and security staff) {K5-A2/3/17} {K5-\nC1/29} {K5-C1/30}; and ( iii) when D1 was seeking information about the Bank’s \n(confidential and privileged) decision to authorise this claim on 19.12.17, D2 anxiously \nchased for updates (“ What are they saying? ”, “Why aren’t you calling? ”) {K5-A2/3/19}. \n(2) In a further series of WhatsApp messages in late 2019, D1 updated D2 on his attempts \nto pressure the NBU into abandoning its banking reforms. This was a joint enterprise: \nD2 encouraged D1’s conduct and provided him with advice. Specifically: \n(a) Between 25.11.19 and 16.12.19, D1 sent D2 30 photographs and 26 videos of \nprotests taking place outside the NBU: {K5-A2/6/31-45}. Many show banners \nbeing waved which say things like “ Smoliy [sc., the NBU’s then Governor ] and \nRozhkova – criminals! ” {K5-C1/270} and “ Smoliy and Rozhkova are the Bonnie and \nClyde of the Ukrainian financial system ” {K5-C1/225}. \n(b) Fifteen of the photographs were sent on 16.12.19 alone, with one showing a \ncoffin and wreaths {K5-A2/6/45}, and four showing demonstrations in \nresidential areas {K5-A2/6/44}. Ms Rozhkova confirmed in evidence that she \nlived on the street shown in the photograph at {K5-C1/280} {Day8/5:2-15}. \n(c) The photographs were sent minutes after D2 sent D1 a link to an article \nreporting that demonstrations outside the NBU had been taking place for a \nmonth and had, in the NBU’s opinion, been paid for by former owners of \nnationalised banks – and in particular D1 – to put pressure on the NBU and \ndiscredit financial sector reforms {K5-A2/6/40} {K5-C1/264}.  \n(d) D1 texted D2 at 13:27 on 16.12.19, having sent nine of the 15 pho"}

A minute after sending the second article, D2 commented: “ And it is \nimportant to pass the law before the court decision ” {K5-A2/6/46}. \n(f) Ms Rozhkova was not challenged on her evidence that these protests, and other \nthreats against her, were “ orchestrated by Mr Kolomoisky ” {B1/5/68} (¶¶283-287). \n(3) On 24.1.19, D1 sent D2 a GPO document setting out the status of a criminal \ninvestigation into their alleged misappropriation (of up to US$5.5bn) from the Bank, \nlisting searches, interviews, expert analyses and requests for foreign assistance that had \nbeen made as at 1.1.19: {K5-A2/4/4} and {K5-C1/100}. This was an obviously \nprivileged and confidential document, to which D1-2 should not have had access and \nwhich was sent with the message ‘1’ ( ibid.). \n(4) On 13.6.19 and 27.6.19, D2 sent D1 three articles about claims brought by D1-2’s \ncompanies in Ukraine regarding collateral given for the Bank’s refinancing debts to \nthe NBU: {K5-A2/5/10}, {K5-C1/150/1}, {K5-C1/151/1}, {K5-A2/5/30} and \n{K5-C1/154}. \n(5) On 30.8.19, D2 sent D1 a link to a news article reporting that the NBU’s former \ngovernor, Valeria Gontareva, had been hit by a car in London: {K5-A2/5/40} (foot \nof page) and {K5-C1/177}. \n(6) On 24.9.19, D1 sent D2 a draft summons to be sent by NABU (Ukraine’s National \nAnti-Corruption Bureau) to Dubilet asking him to attend for interview further to a \nrequest made by the US government for assistance in relation to a criminal complaint \nalleging that funds laundered through the Bank were used to enter into further \nfraudulent and money-laundering transactions in the US {K5-A2/6/6} {K5-\nC1/182/1}. \n(4) How D1-2 controlled their asset empire \n71 D1 is a micro-manager, who was fully apprised of – and gave instructions in relation to – \neven small payments being made within his and D2’s business empire: \n(1) This is what D1 himself has told the press. A Forbes article on D1 states as follows:  \nAA2/15/50\n44 “… Kolomoisky manages the companies personally, delving into the smallest details. \n‘The payment registers (lists of invoices for goods and services, as well as lists of other \nexpenses) of the companies Kolomoisky manages need to be agreed with him,’ says \nKorban. ‘This is the general practice for all of his businesses.’ Why does a billionaire \nneed such a burden? ‘What else am I supposed to do with myself?’ Kolomoisky \nresponds answering a question with a question.” {I3/7/7} \n(2) Bank executives and employees regularly provided D1 with detailed information, and \nrequests for instructions, in relation to payments and other matters relevant to D1-2’s \nbusiness empire. This can be seen from: \n(a) WhatsApp messages between D1 and Chmona (Management Board member; \nHead of Budgeting) found at {K5-A1/11} to {K5-A1/15} (180 messages in \ntotal, covering the period 3.6.15 to 15.1.19). \n(b) WhatsApp messages between D1 and Gurieva (Management Board member; \nHead of BOK) found at {K5-A1/27} to {K5-A1/34} (116 messages in total, \nof which 21 were deleted, covering the period 19.6.15 to 7.6.19). \n(c) WhatsApp messages between "}

It is thus said that the two men “ sometimes invested alongside one \nanother (e.g., in Ukranafta and Nikopol ” and that they “ acted independently ” {AA4/1/49} (¶132). \nThis is a wholly false narrative, which D2 has not supported by stepping into the witness \nbox (see further Section B1 , ¶44 ff above). The documents which have survived and been \ndisclosed show that D2 was not only fully apprised of everything that was happening in the \nD1-2 empire – he was directly involved in large swathes of its management and he, too, took \n{AA2/15/34}\n{AA2/15/29}\nAA2/15/51\n45 interest in the detail (at one point in 2013 amending a monthly credit limit for a senior \nemployee of D1-2’s Privat Intertrading by less than US$20,000 {E1/259} and \n{E1/260.1/2}: see ¶76(3)). \n73 Nor is it right that D2 simply left D1 to deal with their Ukrainian assets as D1 pleased ( cp. \nD2 Opening/¶10 {AA4/1/7-8}). To the contrary, the available written communications \nshow D2 issuing instructions and receiving information in relation to joint assets. In \ncircumstances where they were in frequent (generally oral) contact, the proper inference is \nthat they discussed and agreed on all significant decisions involving joint assets, and in \nrespect of decisions that impacted each other’s interests more generally, and that on matters \nwhere one of D1 or D2 took the lead, the other was kept regularly updated. Their interests \nwere intertwined and mutually promoted. This can be demonstrated in a number of ways. \n74 (1) Inherent probabilities. D1 and D2 are business partners who hold equal or near equal \ninterests in virtually all of their most valuable assets. They are of a similar age, started in \nbusiness together at the same time, and have together amassed extraordinary wealth over \nthe past three decades. Even without more, it is inherently unlikely that one of them operates \ntheir joint assets without the knowledge and involvement of the other. \n75 (2) Means and volume of disclosed communication. Even on the basis of the inadequate \ndisclosure given, it is clear that D1-2 are in extremely regular contact about their businesses: \nsee Section C1  above. \n76 (3) Specific examples of D2’s knowledge of, and involvement with, D1-2’s asset empire. We \nhave given a number of examples here already. But see also: \n(1) D2 has disclosed a set of 30 messages with Markova (a then employee of the Bank’s \nCyprus branch and now employee of Sunaltezza) dating from 14.4.11 to 9.10.12 {K5-\nE/1}, captured as part of his disclosure exercise in the Pinchuk Proceedings and from \na period in wh"}

They are important for a number of reasons: \n(a) They show D2 being involved in the management of (and approving payments \nto be made by) D1-2’s businesses. Thus D2 gives his consent for payments to \nbe made by Feral e.g. {K5-E/1/2} (bottom entry); Georgian Manganese {K5-\nE/1/1} (third and fourth entries); and Euro Tyres {K5-E/1/3}.24 On another \n \n24  E.g. Melnikova says “ At 11/07 from Uri 3,3 million doles [sc. dollars ] at Euro Tires, Romania. Including 2,3 – investment \nbudget and 1,0 – operational budget for the Romanian bus project. Agreed with KIV [sc D1 ].”; and D2 responds “ OK”. \n{AA2/15/43}\nAA2/15/52\n46 occasion, the message to D2 reads: “ Good afternoon. There is an urgent question about \nKievGum [sc. Kievguma, D1-2’s jointly owned rubber plant {A1/17/1} (entries 10-12) ], \nplease call when it is convenient. S Sh [Stanislav Sheyketov25]” {K5-E/1/1} (entry 2). \nSee further the D2 Document Presentation at {Day5/5:3} - {Day5/6:24}. \n(b) They show D2 being provided with information about various other payments. \nTwelve of Markova’s messages start with the words “ For information ”. Here, it \nseems, D2 was not being asked to approve payments, but was being told that \nthey were going to be or had been made. The payments in question relate to at \nleast 17 companies, of which both D1 and D2 have admitted interests in six;26 \nonly D1 has admitted an interest in six,27 and neither has admitted an interest \nin the remaining five28 (further detail of these companies is found at Appendix \nC4). By way of example, the 30.7.12 entry reads thus: \n“For information: for 27/07 payments were made in the amount of USD 3.612 \nmillion. Including 1.281 – 1+1 (from the approved register of payments for July); \n359,000 UN [ sc. Ukrnafta] (monthly payments: CEO Petya 250, deputy CEO 83, \nA. Satton 26); 273,000 DA [ sc. Dniproavia or DniproAzot]; 200,000 payment of \nfinance leasing for 1 of 6 Boeing 737 (from funds received from Aerovsvit); \n499,000 coke nut Azovstal, electrode mass, transport expenses from GM (funds \nfor payment received from GM).” \nMarkova SMS to D2 dated 30.7.12  \nIt is unclear what the “ register of approved payments for July ” was, and D2 has not \ndisclosed any corresponding documents; but the obvious implication is that D2 \nwas approving monthly registers of payments, including for D1’s companies in \nwhich he apparently had no interest (in this example, 1+1). \n(c) They show that D2 was willing to override decisions taken by D1. On 7.5.12, \nMarkova asked for approval for an asset purchase in the context of a liquidation, \nproposed to be funded by payments from Dniproavia (an asset in which D1 \n(but not D2) has disclosed an interest {J2/3/44}), said to have been proposed \nby “Timur [Novikov ]” and “ approved by KIV [D1]”. D2 responded “ Not approved ”. \n(d) They cannot have existed in a vacuum. It is inherently incredible to suppose that \nMarkova only messaged D2 with detailed information and requests for \n \n25  D2’s brother-in law.

The Court should infer that D2 received similar information and \nconsent requests in respect of D1-2 companies before and after the period \ncovered by the disclosed messages. \n(e) Taken together, then, these messages (and the inference that D2 received \nfurther such messages over a much longer period) show D2’s direct \ninvolvement in the operational affairs of his and D1’s joint investments. This is \nno surprise: D2’s 2016 CV explains that his “ professional interests ” are “ banking, \nstrategic management, budgeting, financing, etc. ” {E12/168.1/2}. \n(2) On 21.2.13, Novikov emailed D2 about funds “ withdrawn from the deposit accounts of PBC \ncompanies ” totalling c. UAH 1.2bn ( c. US$148m) at interest rates of 11.5% and 10.5%; \nconfirming that there was a “ project cash balance ” of c. UAH 1.3bn; and listing the \namounts to be used for five projects, including the “ Zemlia M ” project and “ KSW \n(profit tax) ” project {E1/254.1/1}. ‘Zemlia M’ is a reference to the PrivatLand project \n(see further ¶¶95(3) and 118(1) below) and ‘KSW’ is an abbreviation for D1-2’s \nKremenchuk Steel Works {K3-A6/130.1}. \n(3) On 26.2.13, Dubilet emailed D2 with the subject line “ Limits for 2013 ” {E1/259}. He \nasked D2 to “ give instructions ” in relation to credit lines to be issued by the Bank to \nseven “ heads of strategic enterprises ”, i.e. senior executives managing D1-2’s major \nbusinesses. Importantly, before D2 approved the credit limits, he reduced that which \nwas to be available to S.V. Maksimenko (the Head of the Ferroalloy Trading \ndepartment at D1-2’s Privat Intertrading {L/113/2} (¶5.6)) from US$1,020,000 to \nUS$795,600: cp. {E1/259} and {E1/260.1/2}. Indeed, D2 even changed Mr \nMaksimenko’s monthly limit from US$85,000 to US$66,300: ibid.29 \n \n29  As for the other six individuals: \n S.P. Shuvayev : Head of the Management Board at Pokrovskiy Mining and Processing Plant: {K3-\nA6/215/4}, {K3-A7/316}, {K3-A7/317}; {J2/3/2} (D1 U/R Asset 2) {J4/5/144} (D2 U/R Asset \n130).  \n I.A. Volokovoy : manager of some of D2’s business interests {AA1/6/17}; he appears to have been \ninvolved in the administration of inter alia KSW {E1/239} and a Borrower, Fiastra {E2/43} {E3/180} \n V.S. Kutsyn : Chair of Nikopol Ferroalloys Plant between 2002-21: {K3-A7/243}; {J2/3/4} (D1 U/R \nAsset 3); {J4/5/147} (D2 U/R Asset 134). \n P.A. Kravchenko : Chair of Zaporozhye Ferroalloys Plant between 2013-21: {K3-A7/428}; {J2/3/11} \n(D1 U/R Asset 5); {J4/5/145} (D2 U/R Asset 132). \n A.I. Dubinin : Chair of Dniproazot, a large chemicals company in which D1-2 have significant stakes \n{K3-A7/35/1}; {J2/3/94} (D1 U/R Asset 68); {J4/5/139} (D2 U/R Asset 122). \n V.P.Soloshenko : Chair of Stakhanovsky Ferroalloy Plant between 2009-13: {K3-A7/355} {K3-\nA7/356}; {J2/3/1} (D1 U/R Asset 1}; {J4/5/146} (D1 U/R Asset 133). \nAA2/15/54\n48 (4) On 12.12.13, Igor Volokovoy, an asset manager for D2 {AA1/6/17}, emailed D2 and \nNovikov about liquidating a company, Hermes; paying dividends; and moving the \nmoney back to KSW (a D1-2 company) as “ prepayments ” {E2/221}.

It included specific reference to the \nuse of lending to groups of “ traders ” in the same industries as D1-2’s major assets, and \nspeculated as to the under-reporting of related party lending to these groups. Dubilet \ninformed D2 that Shmalchenko had asked if they could refrain from “ touch[ing]” the \ntopic until an issuance of the Bank’s bonds had completed; D2 approved this, saying \n“Okay ”. It is implausible to suggest that D2 was not aware of the context to this article: \nthat a network of shell companies was being used to provide staggering volumes of \nfraudulent lending to D1-2’s jointly owned assets. \n(6) D2 has also disclosed a handful of emails, sent to his secretary Denise Duigan, by \nwhich he was asked to review and sign packs of documents regarding his and D1’s \nassets. For example, on 4.3.11, a Bank employee, Ivan Vatutin, sent Ms Duigan an \nemail saying “ please find attached the documents for GB’s looking through and signing ” {E1/82}. \nThe only attachment disclosed by D2 is a spreadsheet of 32 documents, all marked \n“for signing by GB ” (in 27 cases) or “ for info and discussion ”; they relate to a number of \nD1-2’s major industrial assets30 {E1/83P}. In each case the responsible individuals \nare listed as “ MSV ”31 and Chmona. The items D2 was required to approve include \n“financing ” and “b udgets ” for various enterprises, and in relation to the Ferroalloy \nHolding, include “ instruct [ing] the investment business to work activities ”. Similar further \ndocuments have been disclosed from 2013 and 2014.32  \n \n30  Including Georgian Manganese, Stalmag, Feral, Meritena, NZF, SSF, ZZF, MGOK, OGOK, and DniproAzot.  \n31  Probably Svitlana (Volodimirovna) Melnikova, one of Chmona’s subordinates in the Budgeting Department.  \n32  See for example the email dated 29.4.13 at {E1/335}, attaching a list of documents for review at {E1/338}, \nand substantive documents (formal budgets for Feral and Stalmag) at {E1/336} and {E1/337}. Two further \nattachments to this email were withheld from production by D2 as not relevant. D2 has also disclosed a formal \nbudget for the Ferroalloy Holding for July 2014 that appears to bear his signature (see {E4/75.1/1} and signed \nversion at {E4/75.1L/1}). \n{AA2/15/166}\nAA2/15/55\n49 (7) Again, it is inherently incredible to suppose that the only budget packs that D2 \nreceived are those which have been disclosed: D2 has not sought to suggest that he \nno longer received such budgets after June 2014, and the Court should infer that he \ndid.33 \n77 (4) D2’s very recent disclosure of Grizal and Sunaltezza material. We explained and \naddressed this development in the Bank’s Note of 28.9.23  {AA2/14} and in Section B2  \nabove. We emphasise: ( i) D2’s 20.12.16 email to Anischenko telling him that Markova had \nmoved from the Cyprus branch to Primecap; ( ii) the informality of D1-2’s agreement that \nthey would move their PBC nominees to Cyprus; and ( iii) D2’s close control over \nGrizal/Sunaltezza (signing documents, approving budgets, receiving bank balance updates, \nchasing Novikov when more money was required etc.).  \n78 (5) Inferences.

D2’s involvement in the management and control of all aspects of the D1-2 \nasset empire is apparent from all the matters summarised above, which are drawn from the \ndocumentary materials which have survived. Although they are very far from a complete \nrecord, they show that D2 – like D1 – knew exactly what was going on: he received \ninformation constantly and he granted his approval during his continual communication \nwith D1 and their associates. That state of affairs is further confirmed by a consideration of \nthe remainder of the documentary and evidential iceberg. This is addressed in more detail \nbelow. However, and in addition, adverse inferences fall to be drawn from ( i) D1 and D2’s \nwholly inadequate disclosure, and ( ii) D1 and D2’s decision to abandon any trial evidence \n(and not to call any of their lieutenants or nominees): see Sections B1 and E2 . \nC2 D1-2’ S TRUSTED LIEUTENANTS  \n79 D1-2 had a variety of lieutenants and other associates who would comply with their \ninstructions.  \n(1) Novikov (First Deputy Chair of the Management Board; ECC Member; Head of \nInvestment Business; Boss of Primecap) \n80 Novikov wears a number of hats:  \n \n33  This process continued in a different form after the grant of the WFO: D2 was asked to sign “ Beneficiary \nInstructions ” in relation to D1-2’s assets. For example, under cover of “ Beneficiary Instructions ” dated 18.3.21 \n(which were completed and signed by D2: see {H3/26.4/230}) relating to PrJSC Sintez Transit (in which D1 \nand D2 have both disclosed interests: {J2/3/69} and {J4/5/72}), the “ Beneficiary Instructions ” state that D2 was \nprovided with copies of: ( i) reports given by the management and supervisory boards; ( ii) the independent \nauditor’s report for 2019; ( iii) Sintez Transit’s financial statements for 2019; and ( iv) drafts of proposed new \nversions of Sintez Transit’s charter, code of governance, supervisory board regulations, directors’ regulations, \nand regulations of the general meeting of shareholders. \n{AA2/15/34}\n\u0003{AA2/15/29}\n   {AA2/15/132}\n \nAA2/15/56\n50 (1) First Deputy Chairman of the Bank (in which he was given a 1.6% shareholding34); \n(2) Head of the Bank’s Investment Business (from which the Relevant Loans to the \nCypriot Borrowers originated35);  \n(3) A supervisory board member of “ a number of ” of D1-2’s other companies {I3/12/1} \n(¶1);  \n(4) The ‘boss’ of Primecap; \n(5) D1’s “ right hand man ” (per Mann J in the JKX Proceedings: {I3/54/8-12} [13], [30]), \nwhich has not been disputed by D1 in this case and, as we set out below, he fulfilled \na very similar position for D2; and \n(6) A member of the ECC who approved 127 of the Relevant Loans.36 \n(a) Connections to D1 \n81 Novikov’s close links to D1 are indisputable: \n(1) Novikov’s own witness statement in the Pinchuk Proceedings, dated 12.6.15 ( i.e. \nshortly after the Misappropriation), is addressed at Bank Opening/¶73 {AA2/1/36}. \nCritically, Novikov accepts that his role “ was that of a subordinate required to act on the \ninstructions of [D1] and/or [D2]; my role was not that of a business partner or equal ”. In all, \nthere are over 20 references in Novikov’s statement to his acting on D1’s instructions \nbetween 1999 and 2011 – e.g. ¶¶12, 15, 17 (1999) {I3/12/5-7}, ¶¶135-136 (2006) \n{I3/12/38}, and ¶¶157-158 (2011) {I3/12/46}. \n(2) Novikov stated in the Pinchuk Proceedings that “ Instructions were mainly communicated \nover the phone, by text message or in person.

For example:  {F1/2/5} (AEF), {F1/3/3} (Agroprom), {F1/4/4} \n(Alfatrader). Minutes have not been located for three of the Relevant Loans. In addition, the minutes of the \nECC approving Relevant Loan 4I14167I to Inkom 2001 do not record the individual members who approved \nthe loan: see {F1/21/5}. \n{AA2/15/132}\n{AA2/15/29}\nAA2/15/57\n51 (3) Novikov and D1 exchanged at least 1,471 WhatsApp messages (plus 345 attachments) \nbetween 2.2.17 to 30.9.17 and 22.12.17 to 15.1.19, an average of over two a day. It is \nto be inferred that the communications continued at the same rate in the gap between \nSeptember and December 2017, for which period only one deleted (and still redacted) \nmessage has been disclosed: see Section E2 . \n(4) The examples found at Bank Opening/¶74(4) {AA2/1/37-38}, and explored on \n{Day14/59:1} - {Day14/92:24}, demonstrate that ( i) D1 and Novikov were friends; \n(ii) Novikov was involved in all aspects of D1’s businesses/asset holding structures \n(e.g. around 290 messages were redacted because they are said to reveal details of \nconfidential and irrelevant “ business projects ”, “commercial interests ” or similar); and ( iii) \nNovikov provided direct assistance to D1 in these proceedings (see, e.g., the 130 \nmessages sent during the return date hearing {K5-A1/50/70-77}) – although that did \nnot extend to the imaging of his devices as part of the disclosure process, which \nNovikov allegedly refused to permit: {L/150/2} (¶1.3). \n(5) In addition, D1 and Novikov communicated: \n(a) In person. Novikov had offices in Dnipro, London, Cyprus and New York from \nearly 2013 at the latest {K5-E/2.1/3}. D1 also maintained a Dnipro office. \nNovikov also worked at D1-2’s Geneva office from c. 2016 {K5-E/3.1/4}. \n(b) On the ‘Black’. Novikov had two ‘Black’ extensions, covering his four offices; \nand there are three examples of him and D1 discussing whether to converse “ on \nblack” {AA6/17/6}. \n(c) By mobile phone. D1’s post-nationalisation WhatsApp logs show 67 missed \ncalls from Novikov, and they frequently used WhatsApp to arrange to speak on \nthe phone or meet (see further Appendices C2 and C5 ). \n(b) Connections to D2 \n82 There is overwhelming evidence that Novikov performed a similar right-hand man role for \nD2. The starting point is again Novikov’s evidence in the Pinchuk Proceedings – Novikov \nwas a “ subordinate ” who was “ required ” to act on D2’s instructions. In addition: \n{AA2/15/132}\n{AA2/17/8}\n{AA2/17/38}\nAA2/15/58\n52 (1) Between 8.2.14  and 30.5.14 , D2’s mobile phone records (which do not include \nWhatsApp/‘Black’ calls) show that the two men spoke 120 times for a total of 230 \nminutes – an average of just over one call a day.37 \n(2) Novikov and D2 exchanged 849 WhatsApp messages between 26.4.18 and 20.5.21, \nan average of 280 a year, together with 119 attachments.

Is the market favouring the sale? ” {K5-\nA2/15/3}. \n29.10.18 Novikov messaged D2 regarding budgets of industrial enterprises in which he and \nD1 have interests (the Ferroalloy Holding companies NFP, ZFP, MGOK and \nOGOK) {K5-A2/15/23}. \nNovikov sent D2 a message listing five pieces of Ukrainian real estate (office \nbuildings and hotels), and a list of “ management functions ”, including “ discussion and \napproval of budgets ”, “discussion and approval of capital expenditures ”, “rent policy approval ” \nand “ approval of HR policies ” {K5-A2/15/23-24}. \n12.7.19 Novikov messaged D2 about a Ukrainian company, Novator LLC (in which D1 \nhas disclosed a 100% interest) - it appears to have had an issue with obtaining a \npermit for the “ production of wagons ”. Novikov asks D2 to discuss an alternative \noption “ over the phone ” {K5-A2/15/54}. \n12.5.21 D2 asked to speak to someone about the “ Odesa issue ”, and Novikov responded \nwith the “ Black ” extension number for Melnyk {K5-A2/15/82}. \nInternational assets \n25.7.18, \n4.2.19, \n24.1.20 Novikov messaged D2 about press reports regarding D2’s mining assets in Ghana: \n{K5-A2/15/8}, {K5-A2/15/32} and {K5-A2/15/65}. \n9.8.19 Novikov conveyed a message regarding the “ operations in Ghana ” to D2 from an \nindividual from “ GM Marketing ” {K5-A2/15/57}. \n24.5.19 Novikov messaged D2 in relation to a letter involving an entity called Pinkett \nHoldings Ltd, saying “ this paper cannot be signed. Nevis does not pay taxes. This is what \nwe’re ready to give to Sofia and was already given ”. This shows that Novikov was \n \n37  {K5-E/4}, {K5-E/5}, {K5-E/6} and {K5-E/7} (Novikov’s phone numbers are +44754077807, \n+41792002618 and +41794831582). D2 also disclosed call records related to a particular mobile number from \n10.12.16 to 26.1.17, which show that D2 spoke with Novikov on 10.12.16 and 17.1.17 {K5-E/8/2}.  \nAA2/15/59\n53 involved in the financial arrangements between D2 and his wife, Sofia \nBogolyubova, from whom D2 was purportedly separated {K5-A2/15/3}. \nStructuring and administration \n13.11.18 Novikov confirmed a handover of papers to Andreas Sofocleous (via his \ndaughter), who administered many of D2’s companies {K5-A2/15/25}. \n18.2.19 Novikov told D2 that “ there will be a Primecap guy on Wednesday to sign documents to \ntransfer companies from the ‘bad’ Service Providers to the ‘good’ ” {K5-A2/15/32}. \n27.3.19 D2 asked Novikov who was the beneficiary of a particular asset and asked “ is it \nours?” {K5-A2/15/33}. \n(3) D2 has deleted all of his pre-2017 WhatsApp messages with Novikov, as to which the \nCourt should draw the adverse inferences we have identified. \n(4) The two men also frequently communicated by email: see the 30+ examples listed in \nSchedule 3 of the Bank’s Day 17 hand-up, most of which date from 2013: \n{AA6/17/17-26}. Those emails address a variety of assets, including the Privatland \nprogram, Hotel Split, the Optima group of companies, KSW, Evraz, the Bank (and its \nCyprus branch), Hotel Zirka, land in Kharkiv and media assets.  \n(5) In addition, the two men will have regularly communicated: \n(a) In person.

Both men had offices in Dnipro and London (and, from 2016, \nGeneva too). For example on 19.6.18, Novikov asked D2 “ Can you tell me if you \nwill be in the office soon? ”, and D2 responded “ 15 minutes ” {K5-A2/15/5}. \n(b) The ‘Black’. Both men had multiple ‘Black’ handsets/extensions; and they often \ndiscussed having calls/switching to ‘Black’: {K5-A2/15/53}, {K5-A2/15/75}, \n{K5-A2/15/77}. \n(c) Mobile phone. We have mentioned D2’s 2014 call logs already. But there is a \nfurther point: in their WhatsApp messages between 26.4.18 and 20.5.21, there \nare 56 missed calls from Novikov to D2: e.g. {K5-A2/15/4} and see further \nAppendices C2 and C6 . Because Novikov has not disclosed his messages, we \ndo not know how many times D2 tried unsuccessfully to call him. \n(6) Novikov also worked closely with D2’s executive assistant Anischenko. Here, the 164 \ndisclosed WhatsApp messages (see {K5-A3/11}, {K5-A3/12}, {K5-A3/13}) \nevidence a close-relationship. For instance: \n(a) The day after the WFO was served, Novikov messaged Anischenko saying \n“Vyacheslav, I want to understand if GB has lawyers who represent him in this case? Have \nyou contacted them? What is the answer/Advice?  …”. Anischenko responds “ Thank \n{AA2/17/8}\n{AA2/17/59}\nAA2/15/60\n54 you. I will contact his lawyers who are dealing with a fresh claim from PB ”. Novikov replies: \n“Yes, shake them up! Somehow, we need to consolidate our efforts, Slava ”. The two men \nthen go on to discuss plans with family, and agree to go shopping and ice-skating \ntogether {K5-A3/13/9-10}.  \n(b) On 11.12.18, Novikov asks Anischenko to send him a copy of D2’s passport, \nfor a “ compliance process for the [Oil] Transhipment Enterprises ” {K5-A3/13/26 }. \n(c) Messages on 15.5.20 provide a glimpse at life in the new Geneva office: \nAnischenko buys herring for Novikov from “ the Russian Shop ”, and agrees to \nleave it in the fridge “ on the 4th floor” {K5-A3/13/76}. \n(d) There are frequent requests to “ talk” or meet in person, and Novikov and \nAnischenko communicate via the Black: see {K5-A3/13/100} and Appendix \nC5. \n(The two men also exchanges emails in relation to the Asset Transfer in January 2016: \n{E12/215}, {E12/216}.) \n(2) Dubilet (Chair of both the Management Board and ECC) \n83 Dubilet was the Chair of the Bank’s Management Board and of the ECC (as well as holding \na 3.2% interest in the Bank: {K1/219}).38 He approved all of the 134 Relevant Loans; he \npersonally signed 115 of them; and he gave instructions to subordinates within the Bank to \nhide the Bank’s massive related-party lending in 2015: see Section F1 below.  \n(a) Connections to D1 \n84 D1 has engineered a situation where the Court has virtually no direct evidence of how he \ndealt with Dubilet pre-nationalisation:  \n(1) D1 has disclosed only one pre-nationalisation WhatsApp message with Dubilet, which \nwas deleted from D1’s phone and had to be recovered. Dated 23.12.15, it is thoroughly \nuninformative (“ They confirmed the meeting at 11:00am ” {K5-A1/16/2}).  \n \n38  We get a sense of the value of those shares from two documents.

See \nfurther D2’s valuation of his own interest in the Bank in the Tatneft Proceedings, where he claimed his c. 42% \ninterest was worth US$412m {I3/35/6-7} (¶16). \n{AA2/15/149}\n{AA2/17/38}\nAA2/15/61\n55 (2) D1 has not disclosed any emails, telephone records or diary/calendar records, so there \nare no substantive records of his communications with Dubilet pre-nationalisation.  \n(3) D1’s abandoned trial evidence {B2/1} accepted that Dubilet would consult him on \n“significant matters ” (¶28), but said absolutely nothing about conversations regarding the \nBank’s provision of funds for D1-2’s business, the Bank’s wider loan portfolio, \ncriminal investigations into the Bank, or the allegations published in Glavcom/Nashi \nGroshi that alleged that D1 was personally responsible for the Misappropriation.  \n85 The proper inference both from the available documents (in particular, the post-\nnationalisation WhatsApp messages referred to below) and Ds’ election not to call any \nwitness evidence is that D1 (and D2) frequently discussed issues with Dubilet in person \n(both men had offices in Dnipro), by mobile phone, and on the ‘Black’, and that Dubilet \nreported to and took instructions from D1 (or his associates) on matters that concerned him \n(and D2). \n86 There are, tellingly, hundreds of post-nationalisation WhatsApp messages between the two \nmen. They were addressed at {Day3/3:11} - {Day3/9:8} (Bank’s Opening Submissions) \nand {Day15/22:17} - {Day15/42:14} (D1 Document Presentation). They show that \nDubilet is a man who regularly followed D1’s instructions, in breach of Ukrainian law, and \nagainst the Bank’s best interests. We give examples below: \n(1) Dubilet provided D1 with confidential information from within the Bank. On 9.3.17, \nshortly after nationalisation, Dubilet sent D1 a message informing him that the \nUkrainian President was to hold a meeting at 3pm that day to discuss “ fulfilment of \nobligations by [the Bank’s ] shareholders ” {K5-A1/17/3}. The participants were, Dubilet \nsaid, Valeriya Gontareva (Governor of the NBU), Volodymyr Groysman (Prime \nMinister), Oleksandr Danilyuk (Minister of Finance), and Oleksandr Shlapak (the \nBank’s post-nationalisation Chair). The next day, Dubilet sent D1 a letter that had \nbeen drafted by Shlapak to the President: {K5-A1/17/3-4} and {K5-B5/1}. The \nletter explained that the Bank’s loan book had performed badly in the months after \nnationalisation, and invited the President to arrange a meeting between D1, D2, the \nNBU, the Ministry of Finance and the Bank. Importantly, the letter was in draft – it \nmust have been obtained by Dubilet from Bank employees who remained loyal to him \nand D1, acting against the Bank’s post-nationalisation management.  \n(2) Other similar examples include: \nAA2/15/62\n56 (a) Dubilet sending D1 on 22.3.17 an order served on the Bank requiring it to give \ndisclosure of various documents to the Ukrainian prosecuting authorities. The \norder must have been obtained by Dubilet from sources loyal to him at the Bank \nbecause it bears a PrivatBank ‘receipt’ stamp dated 21.3.17 ( i.e. the day before \nhe sent it to D1): {K5-A1/17/5} {K5-B5/4}. \n(b) On 28.7.17, Dubilet sent D1 the following message: “ Today, Dreling [sc. Oleksandr \nDreling, a member of the Bank’s post-nationalisation Management Board ] … passed on \ninformation that the [NBU ] was seriously discussing the liquidation of "}

The \norder must have been obtained by Dubilet from sources loyal to him at the Bank \nbecause it bears a PrivatBank ‘receipt’ stamp dated 21.3.17 ( i.e. the day before \nhe sent it to D1): {K5-A1/17/5} {K5-B5/4}. \n(b) On 28.7.17, Dubilet sent D1 the following message: “ Today, Dreling [sc. Oleksandr \nDreling, a member of the Bank’s post-nationalisation Management Board ] … passed on \ninformation that the [NBU ] was seriously discussing the liquidation of Privatbank with the \nIMF” {K5-A1/17/25}. \n(3) Against this background, it is implausible that Dubilet did not keep D1 fully appraised \nof the NBU and GPO investigations into the Misappropriation in 2014 and 2015; but \nall records of their communications in this period have been deleted. \n(4) Information regarding the Bank’s audit position. On 15.3.17, Dubilet messaged D1 to \nsay: “ Good news – PWC is not recalling the 2015 PB audit after internal investigation ”. D1 \nresponded with  \u0000\u0000\u0000. Dubilet then added: “ The information is presented by Volkova [a senior \nPwC audit manager ] in the presence of a PWC employee, albeit verbally, but formally, during a \nconversation with Shmalchenko at the PWC office ”.39 To this D1 sent a ‘V’ for victory emoji \n( \u0000\u0000\u0000). The next day, Dubilet added that his source was “ Shcherbakova ” (seemingly \nSvitlana Shcherbakova, a BOK employee) {K5-A1/17/4}. Again, Dubilet was \nleveraging his relationships with Bank employees who were acting against the interests \nof its new management. \n(5) Another audit related example arises when Dubilet asked D1 whether he would “ put \npressure on E&Y auditors as much as PriceWaterhouseCoopers, as analysts fear ” {K5-\nA1/17/7}, to which D1 responded (within 3 hours) by sending a slew of eight press \narticles to Dubilet ( ibid.). \n(6) Co-ordinating work of former Bank staff. A range of former Bank staff remained loyal \nto D1-2 post-nationalisation. Dubilet often co-ordinated the work they were doing, \nreporting back to D1 as follows: ( i) “Vityaz40 will arise in Israel on Friday 12.05 at 12.30am. \nReady to get to work in the morning ” (ibid.); (ii) “Alexey Ponomarev41 is aligned. His total revenue \n \n39  By this stage, Shmalchenko had been removed from the Management Board and PwC had been replaced as \nthe Bank’s auditors. It is unclear why they were meeting. \n40  Alexander Vityaz, a pre-nationalisation Deputy Chair of the Management Board. \n41  The former head of client lending at BOK {AA1/6/5}; and a member of/attendee at ECC meetings, see  e.g. \n{F2/13/1}. \nAA2/15/63\n57 [sc. income ] per month was USD $5,400 ” {K5-A1/17/11};  ( iii) “can Dima42 post this post?... ” \n{K5-A1/17/15}, to which D1 gives a  \u0000\u0000\u0000; and ( vi) “Stelmach43 and Svetlana Igorevna44 \ncalled. If you have time please call them ” {K5-A1/19/3} . \n(7) Dubilet obtained information from within the Bank about the Asset Transfer. On \n3.5.17, Dubilet messaged D1 about the Bank’s main office building in Kyiv known as \n10 Museum Alley, transferred as part of the Asset Transfer {K5-A1/17/9-10}: \nDubilet “Museinyi is on the Bank’s balance sheet ” \nD1 “For how much? ” \nDubilet “I can find out tomorrow morning. ” \nD1 “OK” \nDubilet (3 days later) “5631 sq m – UAH 321,000,000 .” \n(8) Dubilet and D1 procured Ukrainian police to pressurise the Bank’s post-\nnationalisation CEO. On 25.7.19, Dubilet told D1 at 9:59: “ … we need the team of \nGlukhoverya – the head of police in the region [sc. the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast ] – to question [Petr] \nKrumphanzl [sc. the Bank’s then CEO ] tomorrow ” {K5-A1/19/8}. Six hours later, Dubilet \nsent another message to D1, saying “ Thank you!!!! three police officers told … Bolotin [sc. the \nBank’s Head of Security ] that if Krumphanzl doesn’t come in, they will bring him in forcibly ” (ibid.). \nD1’s ability to use the local police to pressurise the Bank’s new CEO is a chilling \nexample of the sway he held even after nationalisation; and amply demonstrates that, \neven after nationalisation, D1 wa"}

Six hours later, Dubilet \nsent another message to D1, saying “ Thank you!!!! three police officers told … Bolotin [sc. the \nBank’s Head of Security ] that if Krumphanzl doesn’t come in, they will bring him in forcibly ” (ibid.). \nD1’s ability to use the local police to pressurise the Bank’s new CEO is a chilling \nexample of the sway he held even after nationalisation; and amply demonstrates that, \neven after nationalisation, D1 was capable of pressurising Bank employees to do \nwhatever they were told (see too Section L  below). \n87 D1 and Dubilet maintained a close business and personal relationship post-nationalisation: \n(1) Dubilet worked in Geneva, alongside D1-2 {K5-E/3.1/2}. \n(2) D1 and Dubilet discussed a business project shortly after nationalisation. Dubilet: \n“Will you have time to talk about the [redacted ] project with the possibility of expanding it for other \nbanks? ” {K5-A1/17/3}). D1’s redaction schedule justifies this redaction on the basis \nthat it hides “ the name of a confidential business project ” {K5-A4/1/390}. \n(3) 35 of the D1/Dubilet messages are redacted on the basis that they “ contain confidential \ninformation relating to the commercial affairs of companies ” (e.g. {K5-A4/1/393}) and five \n \n42  Another reference to Dmytro Dubilet. \n43  I.e. Volodymr Stelmach, the Supervisory Board chair from late April 2015. \n44  I.e. Svetlana Igorevna Scherbakova, ex-BOK. \n{AA2/15/303}\nAA2/15/64\n58 more are redacted on the basis that they contain “ confidential communications regarding \npolitical matters, causes, or affiliations ” (e.g. {K5-A4/1/396}). \n(4) Dubilet – and his family – were often permitted to travel on D1’s private jets. Thus, \non 29.5.17, Dubilet sent D1 his own passport number together with the passport \nnumbers of six others – including at least two relatives {K5-A1/17/11}. Three days \nlater, Dubilet messaged D1 to say “ Everyone had a great flight. Thank you! Timur [Novikov ] \nhanded over the keys. Checked into the apartment ” {K5-A1/17/12}).45 \n(5) On 24.9.19, D1 sent D2 a draft summons requiring Dubilet to be questioned by the \nUkrainian National Anti-Corruption Bureau: {K5-A2/6/5-6} {K5-C1/182}. The \nsummons was served in support of the US authorities’ investigation into money \nlaundering by D1-2. It is unclear whether the draft summons was obtained by Dubilet \nand passed on to D1 (who then sent it to D2); or whether D1 obtained it using his \nvariety of moles. Either way, it is inconceivable that D1 did not discuss the summons \nwith Dubilet, who had enjoyed another holiday at D1’s expense earlier that month: \n{K5-A1/19/10}. \n(b) Connections to D2 \n88 Turning to D2, the picture is no different: the proper inference is that he reported to and \ntook instructions from D2 (or his associates) on matters that concerned him (and D1). D2 \nwas undeniably in frequent direct personal contact with Dubilet prior to nationalisation. \nD2’s telephone records show that he spoke with Dubilet 108 times (for a total of 457 \nminutes) between 3.2.14 and 28.5.14 on the normal cellular network ( i.e. not including the \n‘Black’ or WhatsApp).46 In relation to these phone calls, D2’s written Opening Submissions \nsay that the most obvious inference is that they concerned “ macro-economic problems (and/or \ngeneral banking/personal business) rather than evidencing [D2’s] involvement in the [Misappropriation ]” \n{AA4/1/7} (¶8). This submission must be rejected: \n(1) D2 has given no evidence about what he was discussing with Dubilet. In the absence \nof such evidence, inferences as to the content of their discussion should not be made \n \n45  A similar holiday took place over Christmas 2018, with four members of Dubilet’s family being flown to Tel \nAviv and Dubilet and one other going on to Verona {K5-A1/18/3}. And again in June and August 2019: \n{K5-A1/19/5} {K5-A1/19/10}. On the latter occasion, Dubilet told D1: “ They arrived in Dnipro. Thank you for \na great"}

Thank you for \na great holiday! ... ” (ibid). \n46  {K5-E/4}, {K5-E/5}, {K5-E/6} and {K5-E/7}. Telephone numbers used by Dubilet were +380675223030 \nand +972548031691. \nAA2/15/65\n59 in D2’s favour. On the contrary, it should be inferred that the topics they discussed \nincluded the Misappropriation.  \n(2) Notwithstanding the deficiencies in D2’s disclosure exercise, pre-nationalisation email \ntraffic between D2 and Dubilet shows the type of thing they discussed \n(a) The Bank’s capital needs. On 1.10.13, Novikov emailed Dubilet a proposal \nunder which the Bank would issue UAH 1.3 bn of subordinated debt. The \nsubject line makes it clear that this was “ for approval by GB ” {E2/130.7} \n(addressed further in Section D  below). On various occasions in 2014-15, D2 \nand Dubilet were joint signatories on letters to the NBU asking for the grant of \nstabilisation loans: e.g. {E4/255} and Appendix D1 . \n(b) D1-2’s asset empire. ( i) We have addressed above Dubilet’s request for guidance \non the credit limits to be granted to seven senior managers in D1-2’s asset \nempire; ( ii) on 7.11.13, Dubilet emailed D2 to say “ Chmona said that you gave the \ncommand to increase the funding limit to 17.5 thousand per month. Please acknowledge it ” \n{E2/190}; ( iii) on 17.12.13, Dubilet sent D2 an email containing information \non the performance of D1-2’s jointly owned agriculture business {E2/223.1}; \nand ( iv) on 30.12.13, Dubilet again emailed D2 regarding senior management \ncredit limits {E2/247} {E2/248P}.  \n(c) D2 instructed Dubilet in relation to particular transactions. On 11.3.15, D2 \nforwarded Dubilet a request received in relation to whether the Bank could \nmake a €3 million transfer to Cuba {E8/75}. Later,  on 1.9.16, D2 sent Dubilet \nan email with the subject line “ They are proposing this structure ” {E15/131.1} with \nan attachment setting out the proposed structure and security (over two \nbusiness centres in central Kyiv) of a loan to be granted by the Bank \n{E15/131.2}.  \n(d) D2 discussed assets with Dubilet in the context of the Asset Transfer. On \n2.9.16, D2 received an email from Sergei Distergov (the Chair of, and a minority \nshareholder in, the company operating Hotel Split). It explained that it had \nproved impossible to transfer Hotel Split to the Bank as part of the Asset \nTransfer. D2 forwarded the email to Dubilet within half an hour of receipt, \nasking “ What should be done? ” {E15/132.1}. It is inevitable that D2 would also \nhave discussed other Asset Transfer issues with Dubilet (see e.g. an email sent \n{AA2/15/42}\n{AA2/18}\nAA2/15/66\n60 to him on 6.7.16 explaining that criminal liability might flow from the \novervaluation of assets {E14/303.1}, {E14/303.2}).  \n89 Dubilet often helped D2 with administrative matters well below the pay grade of the Bank’s \nCEO. For example, an email exchange between Dubilet and D2 on 13.6.13 {E2/200.1} \nshows that Dubilet proposed that D2 should use Viber for notification and confirmation of \nall payments on D2’s Privatbank accounts. Later, on 17.1.14, Dubilet emailed D2 to say that \nhe had sent information to him by Viber {E3/18.1}. (Though D2 was required by the first \nPTR Order to conduct a review of his Viber messages {A6/80/1} (see fn. 1), none have \nbeen disclosed.) Other examples include Dubilet providing an analysis of D2’s card \npayments on 23.1.13 {E1/239.3}, sending a raft of bank statements to D2 on 13.6.13 \n{E2/33.01}, and helping D2 with a mobile-phone related query on 11.11.13 {E2/194.1}. \n90 D2 has not disclo"}

But it is clear that D2 stayed in \ntouch with Dubilet post-nationalisation: \n(1) D1-2 gave Dubilet an office in their new Geneva offices: {K5-E/3.1/2}.  \n(2) On 6.2.17, Dubilet emailed D2 the Bank’s 67-page related party list as of 1.12.16 \n{E17/142.1} {E17/142.2}. The body of the email is blank, and no records of D2’s \nrequest for this document have been disclosed.  \n(3) On 21.6.17, D1 asked Dubilet for “ the April draft of the Ernst report ”, to which Dubilet \nreplied: “ Talked to GB. I’m looking for a draft ” {K5-A1/17/14-15}. They may well have \nbeen looking for the (confidential and leaked) draft EY audit report that D2 had \nemailed to himself on 20.4.17 {E17/152.1} {E17/152.2}. \n(4) On 8.2.19, around 40 minutes after Anischenko sent D2 a message asking “ can you \ntalk?”, Anischenko sent D2 a file from Google Spreadsheets titled “ Copy Transaction \nClosing Report ”: {K5-A3/5/405} {K5-D1/4}. The top right of the spreadsheet \nidentifies the Google account holder as dn251062dav@gmail.com, i.e. Dubilet; and \nthe top left identifies the date that the file was created as 15.1.18. The spreadsheet \nitself sets out transactions recorded between “ payer and “ recipient ” (often in quite small \namounts), many of which appear to relate to D1-2’s media interests. Most of the \nrecipients (Kenterco, Lacasti, Aqutel, Vel-Rais (also transliterated as ‘Well Rise ’) are \ncompanies owned by D1-2: {J2/3/37-38} {J4/5/55}. \n(5) In July 2019, D1 arranged a lunch with D2 and Dubilet (and, it seems, his son \nDmytro), at Dubilet’s residence. Their exchange is as follows: \nAA2/15/67\n61 D2  12.7.19 (Friday): “ Did you call the Dubilets for Tuesday. It would be good for me to be \n present. I’m available on Monday or Thursday. What will you say? ” \nD1  “ Monday ” \nD2  “ OK” \n[…] \nD1  14.7.19 (Sunday): “ Tomorrow at 1pm we  [are] having lunch at his place ” \n[…] \nD2  15.7.19 (Monday): “ Are we going? ” \nD1  “ Yes” \nD2  “ On my way ” \nD1-2 exchange about having lunch with Dubilet {K5-A2/5/32-33}  \n91 The preceding paragraphs clearly establish D2’s trusting relationship with Dubilet prior to \nnationalisation, including in the period where the NBU was extremely critical of the Bank’s \n(mis)management and defunct loan portfolio (see Section D ); and D2 and Dubilet’s \nongoing contact after nationalisation. When set in this context, D2’s new accusation – that \nthere is a “ preponderance of evidence ” that “ the senior management of the Bank (such as Mr Dubilet and \nMs Gurieva) [were] responsible for directing the ‘Scheme’ ” {AA4/1/123-124} (¶312) – is not simply \ninherently implausible and evidentially baseless; it is absurd. The Court will note that these \nis no hint of any antagonism towards Dubilet on the part of D2 in the message exchange \nabove. \n(3) Gurieva (Head of BOK; Deputy Chair Management Board; ECC Member) \n92 Gurieva was a Deputy Chair of the Bank’s Management Board and a member of its ECC. \nIn the latter capacity, Gurieva approved 129 of the Relevant Loans. She was also the Head \nof BOK, the department from which the Relevant Loans to 46 of the Borrowers originated; \nshe held a 0.28% interest in the Bank (9th largest shareholder) {K1/219/2}; and she \ncaptained the team that produced the Lafferty Spreadsheets. \n(a) Connections to D1 \n93 D1’s disclosure of his WhatsApp messages with Gurieva, though substantially incomplete, \ndemonstrates that she reported to him and acted on his instructions:  \n(1) Prior to nationalis"}

For example: \n{AA2/15/88}\nAA2/15/68\n62 Gurieva  “Dear Igor Valeryevich, there are taxes from SD UN [sc. Ukrnafta, a D1-2 company ] \n(confirmed by Uri) for approval: 1. Excise duty on liquid gas – 15.7 million, 2. Target gas \nallowance 2% surcharge – 7.4 million, 3. Other minor – 7.0 million .” \nD1 “OK” \nD1 WhatsApp exchange with Gurieva on 29.7.15  {K5-A1/27/2}47 \n(2) After nationalisation, Gurieva continued to perform her treasury function for D1, for \nexample asking D1 on 2.2.18 “ This is for approval (from Russol): UAH 2.02 million wages \nand taxes for November DAF Dnipro ” {K5-A1/32/3}. \n(3) These exchanges are addressed in more detail at {Day14/25:24} - {Day14/32:6}. \nAlthough the record of these exchanges is limited to specific periods of time (see the \nD1 Instant Messages Timeline handed up on Day 13 {AA6/9}), the Court should \ninfer that D1 and Gurieva were in regular contact for those periods for which no \nmessages have been disclosed. \n94 D1 was forced to reveal by the Court’s order of 29.3.22 that Gurieva was the head of the \nnine-member team who produced the Lafferty Spreadsheets: {A6/79} {H2/52/3}. Gurieva \n– and no doubt her team – were working from D1-2’s Geneva office:  \n(1) On 5.1.18, Gurieva messaged D1 using a Swiss (+41) number saying “ Good afternoon, \nI am in the office ”; on 7.1.18 she said “ see you tomorrow! ”, to which D1 replied “ see you \ntomorrow! ” {K5-A1/32/3}. Later, on 13.1.18, Gurieva asked whether she could still \nwork in the office even though D1 would not be coming in (“ the secretaries gave me the \nkey … ”) {K5-A1/32/3}. \n(2) In this period, Gurieva also liaised with other former Bank officials on D1’s behalf: \non 28.12.17, D1 instructed Gurieva “ Send it to DAV [sc. Dubilet ]”, to which Gurieva \nresponded “ Okay ” {K5-A1/32/2}; the unidentified “ it” (presumably discussed \norally), may well have related to the Bank’s claim (issued on 21.12.17). \n(3) As late as 7.6.19, Gurieva messaged D1 to say “ I’m here, thank you very much! I will be in \nthe office Monday, I look forward to receiving the tasks ” {K5-A1/34/2}. \n(b) Connections to D2 \n95 The proper inference from the available material (confirmed by D2’s choice not to call any \nevidence) is that D2 must also have had close connections with Gurieva and that she \n \n47  Similar requests for permission were made on 19.6.15, 29.7.15, 30.7.15, 2.10.15, 22.3.16, 23.3.16: {K5-\nA1/27/2}, {K5-A1/29} and {K5-A1/30}. \nAA2/15/69\n63 reported to and took instructions from him (or his associates) on matters that concerned \nhim (and D1): \n(1) She had entries on both versions of the ‘Black’ directory {K5-E/2.1/1} {K5-\nE/3.1/2}. \n(2) By January to March 2018, when the Lafferty Spreadsheets were being prepared, D2 \nlived in Geneva (and was, for instance, attending the Geneva Meetings: see below). It \nis inconceivable that D2 did not know all about Gurieva’s production of the Lafferty \nSpreadsheets in his joint office with D1, not least because he read and adopted \nLafferty2 in his jurisdiction/set-aside application {H3/3/2} (¶3). \n(3) Although, given the sparseness of the surviving documentary record (and complete \nabsence of fact witnesses), there is no direct evidence of D2 dealing with Gurieva, the \ninference should be made that they had regular oral communication (or written \ncommunic"}

This \nis an understatement: as set out at Appendix C6 , 25 of D1 and D2’s 50 most \nvaluable jointly held assets (listed at {AA6/17/11-16}) were listed as BOK \nclients.48 All of the 23 Borrowers and 17 Intermediary Borrowers in which D1 \nand/or D2 admit interests were also BOK clients. \n(b) On 3.2.11, Novikov emailed Gurieva and Melnyk budgets for the “ Privatland \nprogram ” that had already been agreed by D2. Novikov asked Gurieva to \ndetermine the size of the credit line: {E1/83.1}, {E1/83.2}, {E1/83.3} (the \n“PrivatLand Email” ). Within an hour, Gurieva had set one of her team, Alexey \nPonomarev, to work. Significantly, the Privatland companies included three \nBorrowers, four Intermediary Borrowers, an Asset Transferor and a Share \nPledge company49. The PrivatLand Email is addressed in more detail below. \n \n48  See the list at {E12/316P}, which was attached to an email from Denis Bobro, a legal advisor in BOK, which \nhad the subject line “ BOK Clients List (DNH5) ”: {E12/315}. Those not included on the BOK client list were, \nwith just four exceptions, either non-Ukrainian companies – as a rule, foreign companies were clients of the \nCyprus branch – or bona fide  Ukrainian utility companies, i.e. the Oblenergos). BOK’s clients also included \nUkrainian companies in which D2 admits having held a 100% interest, such as U/R assets 92 and 94 at \n{J4/5/112-113} (nos. 1518 and 279 respectively on the BOK client list).  \n49  Borrowers: Investgroup, Dorteks, Uniks; Intermediary Borrowers: Florex-Industries, Lazurnii Bereg, Mondial, \nVinibur; Asset Transferor: Agroaviadnepr; Share Pledge company: Derling. \n{AA2/17/59}\nAA2/15/70\n64 (c) Similarly, on 20.3.12, Gurieva forwarded a request for lending from “ Gennad [i]y \nBorisovich’s Academ [y] Club ” (which bears D2’s signature and the manuscript note \n‘Agreed’) to Ponomarev “ for processing ” {E1/142.1} {E1/142.2} {E1/142.2L}.50  \n(4) Other Bank employees \n96 We address these individuals in Section D below. \n(5) Anischenko \n97 Anischenko was D2’s executive assistant, responsible for running his private office. \nAmongst other things, he was closely involved in ensuring that jointly owned D1-2 assets \nwere transferred as part of the Asset Transfer in 2016. Had D2 wanted to make good the \ncase that he had distanced himself from D1, and was merely a functionary at the Bank after \nJuly 2014, he should have called Anischenko as a witness. \n98 In the Shulman Proceedings, D2 described Anischenko as “ the person who assists me in relation \nto my personal arrangements and finances ” and as being “ responsible for the running my private office ” \n{I3/22/23} (¶¶56(c)(ii), 68). Anischenko’s own evidence was that he: ( i) worked for the \nBank between 2000 - 2008 and came to know D2; ( ii) was recruited by D2 in early 2008 and \nmoved with him to London in September 2008; ( iii) moved with D2 to Geneva in April \n2017; and ( iv) sees D2 “ almost every day ”  when the two men are in Geneva {I1/23} (¶¶3, 9).  \n99 D2 and Anischenko appear to have communicated primarily orally and in person: \nAnischenko moved to London and then again to Geneva to work directly with D2, and the \ngreat majority of their instant messages for the period 27.9.14 to 17.1.17 {K5-A3/1} are \nrequests to talk, or similar (see examples at Append"}

They also appear to have used \nSignal, from which D2 has disclosed no records {K5-A3/1/190}. \n100 The instant messages disclosed from Anischenko’s devices demonstrate that he \ncommunicated on D2’s behalf with other key lieutenants / intermediaries, although they \nalso suggest that the vast majority of relevant communication was oral. In particular:  \n(1) As is explained above, Anischenko worked side by side with Novikov in the new \nGeneva office post-nationalisation.  \n(2) Anischenko exchanged c. 1,000 messages with Marangos from late 2014 to February \n2022 ({K5-A3/7L} {K5-A3/8L}), primarily arranging to meet in person or speak on \nthe phone or on the ‘Black’ (see examples at Appendix C5 ). \n \n50  The signature at the top of the page is the same as that found on D2’s abandoned trial evidence {B2/11/39}. \n{AA2/15/88}\n{AA2/17/38}\n{AA2/17/38}\nAA2/15/71\n65 (3) Anischenko also acted as a liaison between D2 and Markova both pre- and post-\nnationalisation (see e.g. {K5-A3/10/2} and {K5-A3/9/2}), including in relation to \ntransactions involving Alleged Principals (see the reference to “ Brimm [ilton]” at {K5-\nA3/10/2}), information on accounts held at the Bank’s Cyprus branch {K5-\nA3/9/14}), and interest repayments {K5-A3/9/18}. This is unsurprising given that \nMarkova became a D2 employee in April 2017. \n(4) Anischenko acted as a conduit for instructions to Primecap, and communications with \nPrimecap more generally (see the examples in the Day 17 hand-up {AA6/17/33-39}). \n(5) Anischenko was in direct contact with PBC/Sunaltezza employee Burkhan (see her \nNominee Chart at {K4-A/7}), and liaised with her in 2021 on the filing of HMRC tax \nreturns in relation to “ the client ”, who is never identified by name – but who is obviously \nD2 (e.g. {K5-A3/14/24} and {K5-A3/14/49}). \n101 D2 has not tendered Anischenko as a witness and has not disclosed a single written \ncommunication with him from his own devices between 2013 and 2016.51 Again, the adverse \ninferences to be drawn are addressed in Section B1 above.52 \n(6) Melnyk \n102 Melnyk, who ran PBC for D1-2, played a particularly pervasive role in the Misappropriation, \nand it is to be inferred from the available material that he did so on behalf of D1-2 and \nreported to, and took instructions from, them (either directly or through Novikov or other \nassociates) in doing so: \n(1) He was the sole purported beneficial owner of D4 until 2016 and a purported UBO \nof D3 and D5, along with four other PBC nominees. \n(2) He was a purported beneficial owner of 27 Borrowers and 12 Intermediary Borrowers \n{K4-A/19}, and was removed as the beneficial owner of two shareholders in the \nBorrowers following the Rokoman Email (see Section G5 below). \n \n51  For this period, D2 has disclosed three D2 – Anischenko instant messaging chains from Anischenko’s devices, \nthe earliest of which begins on 27.9.14 {K5-A3/1}, {K5-A3/2}, {K5-A3/3} (no messages have been \ndisclosed prior to that date); and two pre-nationalisation emails, from 2011: {E1/103}, {E1/104}. \n52  Anischenko was D2’s assistant, and does not appear to have played an equivalent role for D1. D2 has, however, \ndisclosed a short exchange of messages between D1 and Anischenko on 26.6.17, in which Anischenko says “ I \nam reporting as you asked - the payment has been sent today . Best regards, V. Ansichenko ”; D1 responds “ Merci!! ” {K5-\nA3/6/2} The lack of context suggests that this followed on from an oral discussion. Next, on 27.7.18, D1 \nmessaged Anis"}

Next, on 27.7.18, D1 \nmessaged Anischenko “ Hey”, and there is a missed voice call 3 minutes later {K5-A3/6/4}. Given the dates, \nit appears likely that these messages were sent while the two men were in Geneva, working at the new office. \nClearly D2 was content for Anischenko to be in direct touch with D1, and D1’s casual tone suggests a familiar \nrelationship. \n{AA2/15/29}\n{AA2/15/185}\nAA2/15/72\n66 (3) He arranged for documents to be executed (and backdated) by companies involved in \nthe Misappropriation and other D1-2 companies: e.g. {E3/184}, {E10/66}. He played \na key role in co-ordinating the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings, requesting loans from the \nBank to the Borrowers to pay their legal fees: {E6/81}, {E6/82P} (see Section F1 ). \nAnd he had extensive involvement in the Asset Transfer. \n(4) He supposedly loaned c. £1.3m to D3-5 for their legal fees in these proceedings. He \ndid not do so from his own resources: there is no evidence that he had any substantial \nassets or wealth, and it has recently emerged that Melnyk became a D2 employee via \nSunaltezza on 1.11.17 and was paid c. €7,500 per month for a full-time “ Senior \nAssociate ” position. \n103 Melnyk held 11 assets for D1 with a combined value of c. US$183m pursuant to oral \nagreements.53 He also holds 19 assets for D2 with a combined value of c. US$116m pursuant \nto oral agreements54 (or “ arrangements that arose by conduct and implication ”: see Section C3 ). As \nhis Nominee Chart demonstrates {K4-A/19}, Melnyk holds management roles at D1 and \nD2 companies. There can be no doubt that he was and is highly trusted by both D1-2.  \n104 D1 has Melnyk’s WhatsApp number, although he has not disclosed any instant messages \nwith him {H2/60/3} (¶13). And Melnyk had a ‘Black’ extension {K5-E/3.1/9}. Indeed, \nD2 clearly knew him, and spoke to him directly, using the ‘Black’, about his assets: on \n12.5.21, D2 asked Novikov “ Is there someone I can speak with about the Odesa issue? ” Novikov \nresponded “ 0163 Sergiy Melnik ”, to which D2 responded “ Thank you ” {K5-A2/15/82 }.  \n105 According to a witness statement from D3-8’s solicitor, Melnyk routinely deleted the \ncontents of his inbox once or twice a year, in the period prior to this litigation {H4/32/10} \n(¶3.8.2); accordingly, only fragments of his pre-2017 emails have been disclosed (see the \nBank’s hand-up at {AA6/10/3}). After speaking to D1, Melnyk also apparently refused to \nprovide his mobile phones and other devices for imaging {H2/60/3} (¶15). \n106 Given Melnyk’s role in acting for D1-2, he could plainly have been called to give evidence \nfor them at trial. It is to be inferred that he was not so called, as his evidence (at least when \ntested on XX) would have revealed his central role in assisting D1-2 with the \nMisappropriation. \n \n53  D1 U/R Assets 42, 43, 45, 49, 65, 68, 69, 70, 82 {J2/3} (Melnyk was belatedly identified in the 14.2.18 {J2/4} \nand 13.7.18 {J2/7} Updates); D1 Non U/R {J1/3/12} and Update {J1/4/1}. \n54  D2 U/R Assets 4, 17, 22, 30, 33, 41, 42, 46, 47, 48, 53, 54, 81, 99, 115, 119, 122, 127 and 129 {J4/5/2}. \n{AA2/15/149}\n{AA2/15/74}\nAA2/15/73\n67 C3 PBC \n107 PBC was incorporated in 2001 under the name ‘Privat Business Centre’.

D2 now accepts that PBC played a significant role \nin the fraud (D2 Opening/¶183 {AA4/1/80}).55 It can be summarised thus:  \n(1) PBC employees (Melnyk, Pugach, Yesipova, Trykulych and Ivlev) were used by D1-2 \nas the purported beneficial owners of D3-5 and D8. \n(2) PBC employees were used by D1-2 as the purported beneficial owners of the vast \nmajority of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers (see the Structure Charts). \n(3) PBC employees were also used as nominee directors of many of the Borrowers  and \nIntermediary Borrowers (POC/Sch. 6 {A1/17.1}); they could be replaced when it \nsuited D1-2’s interests to do so (see the Luchaninov and Rokoman Emails: see \nSection G5 ). \n(4) PBC employees (and in particular Konstantin Barsuk) regularly liaised with BOK \nregarding ( i) the grant, execution, extension and other aspects of the Relevant and \nIntermediary Loans, ( ii) the preparation of the Relevant Supply Agreements, and ( iii) \nthe 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings: see Section F1 . \n(1) D1-2’s ownership and control of PBC \n108 The Court should conclude that D1-2 owned and controlled PBC. PBC’s original name of \n‘Privat Business Centre’ is important evidence of its true ownership. D1-2’s corporate \nempire/companies are informally known as the “ Privat group ” and “ Privat companies ”: see \n{I3/44/2} (¶9);  {E1/11P/2}; {E9/195.4L/11}.56 (D1’s counsel himself put to one of the \nBank’s witnesses that “[ e]veryone in Ukraine knew at this time that if you referred to Privat or the Privat \nGroup, you were referring to what people regarded as the businesses of [D1] and [D2] {Day8/33:17-20}). \nIt was located at all times in the same building as the Bank’s Investment Business: \nLozytska/¶38 {B1/6/10-11}. It is wholly unrealistic to think that D1-2 would have allowed \n \n55  D2’s counsel seems to suggest that PBC did what it did of its own volition, in cahoots with the Bank and \nPrimecap but not under any general or specific direction from D2 (or anyone else): see D2 Opening/Table \n2(8)(b) {AA4/1/67}. That suggestion is risible, and can be discounted in circumstances where D2 was not \nhimself prepared to advance it. \n56  See the references to Privat Communications Ltd, Privat Gard Ltd, Privat Investment, PrivatConsulting, \nPrivatLizings, and PrivatOffice, all being entities “ controlled by the Group as at January 01 2015 ”. \n{AA2/15/185}\n{AA2/15/149}\nAA2/15/74\n68 a third party to start a business, trading from the same building as their  bank, which used \ntheir group’s name.  \n109 PBC’s name change to ‘Pridniprovskyi Business Centre’, carried out on 6.4.0557 presumably \nto create distance between it and D1-2. That did not change PBC’s ownership or operation: \nits shareholders remained a cast of familiar Ukrainian companies (including “ Privat Service \nCentre  LLC ” until 8.2.07), which are all variously linked to D1 and D2 (see Appendix C8 ); \nand there is no record of any management buyout or similar having taken place. PBC was \nclearly considered part of the Privat group: in December 2010, for example, PBC’s \nemployees were asked to vote, alongside Bank and Primecap employees, on a logo for the \nnewly established Primecap and were directed to use their corporate email addresses \n(“pbc.dp.ua ”) to do so {E1/57.01}. Unrelated companies do not typically allow each other’s \nemployees to choose their logo.  \n110 D1 and D2 have both made partial admissions of interest in PBC:  \n(1) D1 claims to have accidentally acquired a 24.79% interest in PBC between September \n2013 and February 2014, squarely in the middle of the Misappropria"}

Still less would the owners of a legitimate independent \ncorporate services provider have transferred their shares in their own business to D1-\n2 for no consideration.  \n(2) D2 would have had no interest in acquiring these de minimis  interests in PBC; or in \naccumulating shares in PBC on a monthly basis in January and February 2014 (3.54% \n 5.04%  11.08%) before selling a 4.5% stake in March 2014, only to acquire a \n \n57  See the official registry extracts for PBC as at 5.4.05 (pre-name change) at {K3-A6/224/3}, and a later extract \nrecording the date of the change at {K3-A6/225/5}. \n58  D1Def/¶10C(2)(d) {A1/8/8-9}, D1 RRFI/¶7 {A2/31.1/5-6}. \n59  D2Def/¶18C(2)(c) {A1/18/9}, App. B {A1/19.1}. \n{AA2/17/64}\nAA2/15/75\n69 further 1.26% interest in April 2014. D2 was not prepared to be questioned on this \nquixotic approach to company ownership.  \n(3) Instead, the obvious inference is that ( i) D1 and D2 owned (and were aware they \nowned) PBC at all times, but that this ownership was structured in the opaque and \never-changing manner that D1-2 used for many of their other companies, including \nlarge numbers of the Borrowers; and ( ii) D1-2 have been forced to admit ownership \nof fractional interests in PBC because they were held in the same structures as held \ntheir interests in certain Borrowers/Intermediary Borrowers. See further Appendix \nC8 for a complete list of PBC’s shareholders over time, and D1-2’s connections to \nthem.  \n(4) D1-2 have gone to significant lengths to avoid revealing PBC’s existence and function:  \n(a) PBC was not included as a potential custodian of D1-2’s documents until the \nBank identified it in December 2021 {L/30}. That is a striking omission given \nD1-2’s Model E disclosure obligations in relation to ownership and control of \nrelevant entities. \n(b) PBC was not mentioned in D1-2’s witness statements.60 \n(c) D1-2’s asset structures are replete with PBC employees; but they are only named \nas individuals; their common employer was concealed.  \n(d) Nor was their employer identified in answer to correspondence sent and an \napplication issued by the Bank in May/June 2018 which sought to ensure that \nD1-2’s nominees were bound by the WFO: {L/3/2} {L/4/1} {G1/22.1}, \n{G1/22.2}. When D1 responded on 9.7.18, his solicitors identified that a \nnumber of nominees acted for particular CSPs – including Primecap – \nseemingly in order to make the point that “ you are already aware of their business \naddress [es]”; but the response studiously avoided explaining that “ Mr Sergey Melnik \n… as well as [various other ] individuals ” had any association with PBC (or, by that \nstage, Sunaltezza): {L/5/2}.

Connections between these companies (subsequent \nshareholders) to D1-2 are set out at Appendix C9.  \n(2) PBC’s role in holding D1 and D2’s assets \n112 D1 and D2 used PBC nominees to hold and control their assets, including both legitimate \nassets and the Ukrainian companies involved in the Misappropriation. \n113 In total, D1’s asset disclosure identifies that 36 of his Ukrainian assets, in which his interests \nare valued at c. US$1bn, are held via structures involving oral agreements with PBC \nemployees; and D2’s asset disclosure identifies that 79 of his Ukrainian assets, in which his \ninterests are valued at c. US$470m, are held in the same way. See further the tables at \n{AA6/11} (D1) and {H1/82/1-7} (D2). \n114 This use of PBC employees as ‘nominee UBOs’ (an oxymoron, and, as observed by Bryan J \nin Yurov, an inherently dishonest practice61) is long-standing: D2’s 2007 and 2008 asset lists \nidentify PBC employees as the “ intermediate beneficial owners ” of D1-2 assets {E1/29P}. \nIndeed, D2 finally accepted on 17.5.23 (having never done so previously) that PBC played a \nlong-standing role in structuring his assets: “[ t]hese holdings were structured with the assistance of \nrelevant tax and legal advisors, PBC and corporate service providers ” {L/155} (¶4). \n115 D2 has offered strikingly inconsistent explanations as to how he made his oral agreements \nwith the PBC nominees in relation to his admitted assets:62 \n(1) In his initial non-U/R asset disclosure, D2 revealed that three assets were held “ for the \nbenefit of [D2] on the basis of an oral agreement between [a named trustee ] and [D2]” {J4/3/42} \n(and see also pp. 43, 44, 46, 48 and 52-54). \n(2) Under pressure of an application issued by the Bank, D2 updated that disclosure in \nJune 2019 {J4/5}. There, he described the oral agreements in the following terms:   \nE.g. – “100% of the shares in Mantara Holdings Limited [Cyprus] are held by a \nnominee, Panikos Symeou, on bare trust for Serhii Melnyk. Pursuant to an oral \nagreement between Mr Melnyk and Mr Bogolyubov, the 46% indirect interest in \nMantara Holdings is held by Mr Melnyk for Mr Bogolyubov.” {J4/5/2} \n \n61  NBT v Yurov per Bryan J at [514] {M1/22/182}. \n62  D1 has said nothing further in this regard beyond the descriptions in his asset disclosure of the relevant \narrangements as being “ oral agreements ”. It appears, therefore, that he stands by this description, and admits \nhaving made oral agreements with the relevant individuals. \n{AA2/17/64}\nAA2/15/77\n71 (3) Importantly, this or an equivalent explanation was given in relation to 109 assets with \na value of US$493,099,487.16: {H1/82/1-7}. In total, there are 79 references to oral \nagreements with PBC staff (including 21 with the ubiquitous Melnyk).  \n(4) However, in Bogolybov6 (28.2.23), served in response to the Court’s Dadourian order \n{H3/23}, D2 said: “ I would like to clarify that I did not enter into each of these ‘oral agreements’ \npersonally. Rather:  I understand they were entered into by individuals who had responsibility for \nstructuring my assets. The first I heard of this was after the Proceedings commenced and in the course \nof putting together my asset disclosure.

(We note in passing that D2 chose not to disclose that \nhe was, between 2017 and at least late 2019, the indirect employer of Melnyk and  \nother nominees with whom he had oral agreements: see further Section B2  above.) \n(5) That was quite a revelation. But there was more to come. By letter dated 17.5.23, D2’s \nsolicitors said that in fact there were no oral agreements at all. Instead, the \narrangements “… appear to have arisen by conduct and implication. The arrangements are not \ncontained in a written document, nor have they arisen from a particular individual’s express words in \na particular conversation. … the individuals’ understanding arose from their role as nominees….  \nBeyond the understanding that the individual was to hold the interest on [D2’s] behalf, there are no \nexpress terms of the agreement to disclose, because no more specific terms of that  understanding were \nagreed ” {L/155/2} (¶¶6-8). \n(6) The Court considered this saga on 23.5.23,63 and ordered D2 to disclose various details \nabout his arrangements by conduct and implication unless he was able to provide \nwritten records of the arrangements instead {A6/116/2} (¶1(b)).64 \n116 The key takeaway is this: to hold hugely valuable assets in such an informal way (whether an \noral agreement or an even more informal arrangement by “ conduct and implication ”), D1 and \n \n63  As the Court observed during the course of argument: “I mean, it really does sort of defy belief that he doesn’t have the \nmeans of getting where he needs to get to in order to protect his own assets.” {G3/45/12} (internal p. 44, lines 22-24). \n64  In the event, D2 produced written records dated between 2018-2022 in relation to all of the “ arrangements ” \nrelating to assets worth more than US$1million: {A6/116/2} (¶1(a)), {H3/26/2} (¶6). Their existence was not \nrevealed by D2 when he gave his (revised) asset disclosure in June 2019 and it is apparent from D2’s disclosure \nthat he personally executed no fewer than 34 deeds of trust in 2018 without the Bank’s consent: see Hogan \nLovells (5.9.23) {L/195/2}. Enyo’s response was that “ we understand that a decision was made…in conjunction with \nour client’s then legal team that these changes did not require notification to, or consent from, your client pursuant to the WFO ”: \nEnyo (9.6.23, 3rd) {L/163.2/2} (¶4). D2’s execution of those documents is flatly inconsistent with Enyo’s letter \nof 17.5.23, which stated that the “ arrangements are not contained in a written document ” {L/155/2} (¶6) (emphasis \nadded). \n{AA2/15/34}\nAA2/15/78\n72 D2 must have had absolute faith in the nominees. The most likely explanation for this faith \nis that D1-2 owned and controlled PBC; and that they paid the salaries of the PBC nominees \n(as, in 11 cases, D2 has finally been forced to admit that he did). \n(3) D1 and D2 giving instructions via PBC nominees \n117 As demonstrated by the Nominee Charts, PBC employees also held at least 149 roles as \nsupervisory board members and chairs, audit commission members and chairs, and \nCEOs/directors of 45 of D1 and/or D2’s assets. But PBC employees were used as nominees \nto fill these roles: BOK and other Bank staff were able to arrange for them to be swapped \nout of their positions at will, if for example their appointment caused related-party/capital \nadequacy headaches: see Bank Opening/Sch. 3 {AA2/2/4-8}. \n118 In mo"}

It is unclear \nprecisely how D2 signified his approval to the budget, but it is plain from emails ( iii) \nand ( iv) in the chain that he must have done so. Many if not all of the companies \nreferred to in the budget were administered by PBC, which no doubt explains why \nNovikov sent the email to Melnyk at stage ( iv): see, e.g., Investgroup {K4-B3/22}, \nLazurnii Bereg {K4-B4/13}, Mondial {K4-B4/20}, Vinibur {K4-B4/34}.66 \n \n65  {K3-C2/100}. \n66  A similar email, in relation to the same project, is dated 18.1.10 {E1/47}. This email was “ prepared by Rzhevskiy ” \nand sent by Shaverin (PBC: {E1/47L}) to Gurieva, and explains a refinancing scheme in relation to the “ M \nLand Plots project ”. It involved increased borrowing on the part of Agroviadnepr (a D1-2 company, which held \nthe Dnipro aerodrome {E12/216/3}), with interest to be paid “ after approval of the financing limit for 2010 ”. \nThough D2 is not involved in this chain, his consent is highly likely to have been sought – as it was in 2011. \nAA2/15/79\n73 (2) D2 issued instructions to Novikov in respect of litigation involving land plots held by \nfive “ PBC Companies ” in March 2013 {E1/273}: these instructions (“ we won’t fight ”) \nmust have then been passed from Novikov to PBC for implementation by the PBC \ndirectors of the five companies, although no such records have been disclosed. \n(3) Novikov sought further instructions from D2 about the same land plots in October \n2013, attaching to his email a letter to the director of one of the “ PBC Companies ” \n(Uniks); he asked D2 to “ determine further actions regarding the land ” {E2/170.01}, \n{E2/170.02}. \n119 After the WFO was granted, it appears D1-2 were asked to give at least some instructions \nto their PBC nominees more formally. For example:  \n(1) The draft beneficiary instructions at {E17/258.4} sought D1’s instructions as to \nwhether Lonwood Trading should allocate dividends. Lonwood in turn had c. 9% \ninterests in three Borrowers, each of which had a PBC director (Rudnex: Hayvoronska \n{K3-A1/147/4}; Empire: Davydenko {K3-A1/46/4}; and Esmola: Boyko {K3-\nA1/48/4}). \n(2) On 2.4.18, Primecap emailed CadCool (D1’s secretarial service, owned by his sister, \nLarissa Chertok {E7/111.1/2}) attaching draft resolutions of Fenwick and Founttaro \nrelating to the affairs of their Ukrainian subsidiary, Arlan: {E17/239.6.01}, \n{E17/239.6.02}, {E17/239.6.03}, {E17/239.6.04}.

Arlan’s director is identified in \nthe minutes at {E17/239.6.04} as Natalia Nikolaevna Shkraprova – a PBC employee \n{K3-C2/73}, {K3-C2/74}.  \n120 Finally, D2’s position is now that “[ t]he evidence shows that it was in fact employees of the Bank, \nPrimecap and/or PBC  who administered the ‘Scheme’ and/or determined how the Borrowers participated \nin the ‘Scheme’ ” {AA4/1/67}. However, tellingly, rather than severing his relationship with \nPBC after purportedly learning of their role in the Scheme, it has now been revealed that D2 \nbecame the indirect employer of a raft of PBC nominees – including the ubiquitous Melnyk. \nC4 PRIMECAP  \n121 Primecap is a Cypriot company incorporated in July 2010. It was managed by Novikov who, \nthough notionally a “ senior consultant ” entitled to a £206,250 salary for 27.5 hours a week \n{E1/294.1/3}, was its “ boss” (his email was invboss@primecap.com.cy – standing for \nAA2/15/80\n74 ‘investment boss’). According to its filed accounts, Primecap had  c. 45 employees in the \nperiod 2013-16.67 \n122 Primecap’s role in the Misappropriation, which it is to be inferred from the matters outlined \nbelow it undertook on behalf of D1-2, was as follows: \n(1) Administering D3-8 both before and during the Misappropriation, including by giving \nnumerous instructions for D3-8 to execute (and backdate) RSAs. \n(2) Administering the Alleged Principals of D3-5 and procured them to execute sham and \nbackdated ‘instructions’ to D3-5 to mislead the latter’s accountants/HMRC.68 \n(3) Administering the Cypriot Borrowers (Fiastra, Celastrina and Densitron). \n(4) Directing the participation of D3-8 in the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings, including by \ngiving instructions for D3-8 to execute sham correspondence and agreements between \nD3-8 and the Borrowers to show to the Ukrainian Court. \n(5) Arranging the transfer of D1-2’s assets to the Bank during the Asset Transfer. \n(1) D1-2’s ownership and control of Primecap \n123 Primecap was incorporated in July 2010 by Andreas Marangos, a Cypriot nominee with close \nconnections to D1 and D2 (see Section C5  below). Its registered office was in the same \nbuilding in Limassol as housed the Bank’s Cyprus branch and the offices of Marangos & \nHadjipapa ( “M&H” ): 113 Arch. Makariou III, 3021 Limassol (see {E16/157.1} (Cyprus \nbranch, ground floor); {E11/264.1/3} {E14/156} (Primecap and M&H, first floor)). \n124 D1 admits ( i) that Marangos held 100% of Primecap’s shares on trust for him from its \nincorporation in July 2010 until January 2011, and ( ii) having owned 50% of Primecap from \nJanuary to May 2011: D1Def/¶10B {A1/8/7-8} and D1 RRFI/¶2 {A2/31.1/3}. \n125 On 20.1.11, Marangos transferred 100% of the shares in Primecap to Primecap Investments \nLtd, a Kitts & Nevis company ( “Primecap Nevis” ). That must have been on D1’s \ninstructions, as the UBO of Primecap. At that point, the 100% registered shareholder of \nPrimecap Nevis was Christoforous Loukaidis (a M&H employee),69 who held 100% of the \nshares in Primecap Nevis on trust for Ralkon Commercial Ltd.70  Ralkon had two 50% \n \n67  {E4/127.1/17}, {E11/264.1/17} and {E17/180.11/18}. \n68  See {E11/19}, {E11/25}, {E11/136}, {E11/137}, {E11/139}, {E11/155}, {E11/215} and attachments: \n{E11/216} to {E11/233}, {E11/190} and attachments {E11/191} - {E11/211}. \n69  D1 RRFI/¶3{A2/31.1/3} \n70  See the Deed of Trust at {K3-B/500L/1}.

(Ralkon’s written resolution confirming that \nMarigold became a 50% owner on 3.4.09 is found at {K3-B/529L/69}.) D1 must have \nknown he was transferring 50% of his interest in Primecap to D2 (presumably because it \nplayed (or was intended to play) such an important role in relation to both of their assets).  \n127 D2 pleads no knowledge of this transfer {A1/18/8} (¶18B(2)(c)), although he appears to \nhave reneged on this position in the course of trial, and now acknowledges that he “ acquired \na 50% interest in Ralkon in 2009 ” {AA6/19/22}. Accordingly, it can be safely inferred that, \nin January 2011, Marigold held its 50% stake in Ralkon, and therefore in Primecap, for D2. \n128 Accordingly, as at January 2011, Primecap’s ownership structure was as follows: \n129 D1-2 plead that the ultimate ownership of Primecap passed to its senior employees in May \n2011. In fact, D1-2 continued to own and control Primecap:  \n(1) In May 2011, Primecap’s shares were transferred to Amalia Hadjipapa: {K3-B/502L}. \nBut no document has been disclosed to suggest that Hadjipapa held that interest for \nPrimecap’s employees at this time, and D1 and D2 have of course failed to adduce \nany witness evidence as to any such arrangement. Hadjipapa is a longstanding nominee \nof D1-2’s: she appears in D2’s asset disclosure and in four disclosed historic asset \n \n71  See the director’s resolution approving the transfer of shares dated 21.5.09 at {K3-B/529L/69}. \n72  See the Deed of Trust at {K3-B/500L/7}. \n73  D1 RRFI/¶3 {A2/31.1/3} \nAA2/15/82\n76 lists,74 and she is Marangos’ partner in running M&H. She is also his wife. It is to be \ninferred that there was no transfer of beneficial ownership at this time, and that \nPrimecap continued to be owned and controlled by D1 and D2.  \n(2) The only documentary evidence of any such transfer dates instead from April 2013 \n(i.e. two years after the date pleaded by D1), and comprises a set of trust deeds \npursuant to which Hadjipapa is said to hold her interest in Primecap Nevis on trust \nfor 12 Primecap employees linked to D1-2, in particular: \nPrimecap \nemployee % interest Connections to D1-2 \nTimur Novikov  9.9% {K3-B/507L/11} See Section  C2(1) . \nOleksandr \nKoltyarenko   9.1% {K3-B/506L/8} Gave a witness statement in the Pinchuk Proceedings \nin which he states that he “ received [his] instructions \ndirectly from Mr Timur Novikov, who has a close working \nrelationship with [D1 and D2 ]” {I3/16/2} ( ¶6).

This “ Ocean’s 11 ” or “ Footballers ” ownership structure kept \neveryone’s interest just below 10% (as described by the NBU: {E11/127/11}) and \nensured Primecap was not a related party of the Bank (as it would have been had \nNovikov held more than a 10% interest) Instead, from 2013 onwards, Primecap was \nremoved from the Bank’s related party lists.77  \n(2) There is no evidence that the purported transfer to the Primecap employees was a \ngenuine management buy-out. If D1-2 were genuinely selling this business to these \nemployees – along with the revenue stream consisting of CSP fees – the Court might \nexpect to see an SPA setting out the terms of an arm’s-length management buy-out. \nBut there is nothing. \n(3) Tellingly, D1 continued to pay Primecap’s costs: on 20.10.16, Markova asked for D1’s \napproval for the payment of US$630,000 pursuant to a “ request from Timur [Novikov ]” \nmade in respect of “ business aviation, Primecap tax and soc. insur, lease of Transit SA office in \nGeneva… ” {K5-A1/42/4}. D1 responded “ OK” {K5-A1/42/4}, rather than querying \nwhy he would pay taxes for a company he allegedly sold five years earlier. \n(4) No dividends were paid to Primecap’s purported employee shareholders in 2013-\n2016.78 Instead, in 2017 Novikov (and only Novikov) received 1,000 non-voting \npreference shares in Primecap entitling him to a dividend of US$1.2m p.a. {K3-\nA8/14}. It is to be inferred that this was compensation from D1-2 for the loss of his \nrole at the Bank, and as a reward for his continued loyalty. If Novikov’s 11 co-\nshareholders in Primecap really held their shares beneficially, there is no good reason \nwhy they would have agreed that a mere 9.9% shareholder would be entitled to a \ndividend equal to Primecap’s annual net profit between 2013 and 2016. \n131 In light of the above, the Court should find that Primecap was owned and controlled by D1 \nand D2, and continued to be owned and controlled by them after they purported to have \ndisposed of their interests in 2011.

See {E4/127.1/4-7}, {E11/264.1/4-7}, {E17/229.1/4-7}, {E17/180.11/4-7}. \nAA2/15/84\n78 nationalisation, D2 emailed Anischenko to explain that the Cyprus branch was “ done” and \nthat Markova had moved to Primecap. At least she only had to walk up the stairs from the \nground floor to the first floor. \n(2) Primecap’s role: administration of D1-2’s companies \n132 In aggregate, D1-2’s asset disclosure shows that: \n(1) 33 of D1’s admitted assets were held by 10 Primecap nominees pursuant to oral \nagreements under which the nominees acted as nominee shareholders of either the \noperating company or holding companies: {AA6/11/32-4}. \n(2) 80 of D2’s admitted assets were similarly held by eight Primecap nominees pursuant \nto oral agreements: {H1/82/1-7}. \n133 In addition, Primecap was frequently also involved with (and administered) non-Ukrainian \ncompanies or assets in which D1 and D2 do not admit interests (but which the Bank says \nare owned and controlled by them). These include the Cypriot Borrowers, D3-5, their \nAlleged Principals and other Suppliers. Examples of Primecap’s involvement in procuring \nthe execution of documents by D3-5 were given at Bank Opening/Sch. 5 {AA2/2/13-20}, \nwith Cypriot Borrower examples at {Day14/114:1} - {Day14/121:12}. \n134 Primecap’s employees were individuals transferred over from the Bank (predominantly \nNovikov’s Investment Department). The available documents show that those individuals \ncontinued to perform the same roles they had done while they were at the Bank ( i.e. \nadministering D1-2’s companies).79 To do so, Primecap employees maintained close \nrelationships with their former colleagues at the Bank: e.g. senior Primecap and Bank \nmanagement (including Novikov) went on holidays together in October 2016 {E16/33.3}. \n135 Following belated disclosure from Primecap, there is now a substantial documentary record \nof Primecap relaying questions from “ the client ” to the Cypriot CSPs about D1-2s’ companies \nand directing the nominee directors of such companies to enter into transactions by \n \n79  For example, when Nikolai Kravets (Cyprus branch) asked the Primecap, and former Bank, employee Yuliya \nPrykhodko on 25.11.11: “ who are you and what are you working on? ”, Prykhodko replied: “ I have worked in the \nInvestment Business as a lawyer for 10 years with T.Y.

It is wholly implausible to \nsuppose that Primecap simply instructed D1-2’s companies to enter into transactions \nwithout their knowledge and approval. Instead, it is to be inferred that they did so on \ninstructions from D1-2, conveyed via Novikov. \n137 That inference is further confirmed by the ‘Authorisation Letters’ signed by D1 and D2 after \nthe WFO was granted, in relation to a number of holding companies in their asset empire, \nsent from them to SK Law and copied to Primecap. Examples of these Authorisation Letters \nare listed in the Bank’s hand-up at {AA6/17/46-48}. Importantly, they contain an express \nacknowledgment from D1 and D2 that: “ prior to the [date of the letter ] the Nominees [sc. SK ] have \nreceived instructions with respect management and administration of the company from Authorised Persons \n[sc. Primecap ] (Previous Instructions) and hereby confirm that a) all and any of such Previous Instructions \nwere given with [D1 / D2’s ] concent [sic] and/or authorisation … ” {E17/235.10/13} (D1 \nAuthorisation Letter for Eurotyre); {E17/239.1} (D2 Authorisation Letter for Eurotyre). In \nother words, the Authorisation Letters confirm that there must have been undocumented \noriginating instructions from D1-2. \n138 As with PBC, D2 now says, through counsel, that Primecap “ administered the ‘Scheme’ ” and/or \ndetermined how the Borrowers participated in it {AA4/1/67}. Tellingly, rather than \nsevering his relationship with Primecap after learning of their role in the Scheme, which D2 \nis driven to accept was targeted at his Bank, D2 has instead continued to trust Primecap to \nadminister his assets: the Bank received a WFO consent request in relation to D2’s payment \nof almost €240,000 in fees to Primecap in respect of their services as recently as 2.6.23 \n{L/161.1}. \n \n80  Pushenko emailing Gramaro in relation to the financial statements of Demelza (D1-2 have admitted a \ncombined 50% in Demelza: {J2/3/5} (D1 U/R Asset 3) and {J4/5/145} (D2 U/R Asset 132) stating “ the \nClient also asks to send us calculation of cost of NZF shares ”. \n81  Pushenko emailing Gramaro in relation to the financial statements for Humax Enterprises: “ would you be so kind \nas to explain us the calculation of article Exchange profit and Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash held?

One of them – M&H ( i.e. Marangos & Hadjipapa) – \nassumes particular importance because Marangos was the director and shareholder of \nCollyer (D5) until 2.5.14. Marangos was another with close links with D1-2 (particularly D2): \n(1) Marangos acted as nominee shareholder or director of a number of companies owned \nor controlled by D1-2, going back to 2006 and 200784. \n(2) Marangos had an extension on the ‘Black’ {K5-E/3}. \n(3) Marangos was well-known to Novikov and other senior employees of the Bank and \nPrimecap: he  went on holiday with Primecap employees in early 2017 to the Lofoten \nIslands {E16/33.3}; and Novikov was best man at his wedding, which D2 and \nAnischenko also attended {H1/73.02/1}.  \n(4) Marangos and his partner Hadjipapa acted as directors of Sim Lim Trust Company, \nthe corporate trustee of at least 21 of D2’s trusts which were redomiciled from Jersey \nto Cyprus in late 2015 {E14/315} {E18/188}. \n(5) D2 has disclosed c. 1,000 WhatsApps between Anischenko and Marangos from late \n2014 to February 2022. The great majority record arrangements to speak or meet, \nconfirming that Anischenko was a conduit for D2 to pass information to the Cypriot \nCSPs involved in the day-to-day operations of his companies: e.g. {K5-A3/7L/18}. \n(6) D2 has disclosed 23 SMS messages he exchanged with Marangos between 12.1.11 and \n2.10.12. Theirs is obviously a relationship of some familiarity ( e.g. Marangos: “ Balshoi \nPriviet moi brat! I am [in] Sardinia in a supermarket and I am looking for the healthy sirup (like \nhoney) what is the name? ”; D2: “ Agave nectar ” {K5-E/1.1/1-2}).  \n \n84  See D2’s 2007 asset list at {E1/29P/2} and references to Marangos acting for D1-2 in 2006 {I3/12/28-38} \n(¶99-101, 134). \nAA2/15/87\n81 (7) D2 and Marangos had meetings in person. In early 2016, Marangos was summoned \nto London on at least two occasions: once on 22.1.16 (see {K5-A3/7L/44}, K5-\nA3/7L/46) and again in London on 23.2.16 {K5-A3/7L/48}. These meetings were \nprobably concerned with the process by which D2 could extract his assets from the \ntrusts recently re-domiciled to Cyprus of which Sim Lim Trust Company (owned by \nMarangos) was the trustee: beginning in March 2016, a large number of OSFs and \npetrol stations flowed out of these trusts to the Bank as part of the Asset Transfer. \n• • • \nD D1-2’ S CONTROL OF THE BANK \n141 The key points developed in this section are these: \n(1) D1-2 exercised complete de facto  control of the Bank before its nationalisation. They \ndid this through their formal rights as 90%+ shareholders, which they used to install \nthemselves on the Supervisory Board; through their rights as Supervisory Board \nmembers, which they used to appoint people who would do their bidding (Novikov, \nDubilet, Gurieva and the others) to the Management Board; and then through their \nrelationships with, and control of, those beholden and loyal individuals, with whom \nthey communicated constantly on the ‘Black’ and by other undocumented means.  \n(2) Even outside this network of loyal senior officers and employees, D1-2 ensured that \nthere was a culture of extreme deference, even fear, within the Bank, reinforced by \nD1-2’s reputations as aggressive businessmen and the knowledge that Bank employees \nwould lose their jobs if they didn’t do as they were told. \n(3) Through these means, D1-2 controlled all significant decisions made by the Bank, and \nin particular those relating to the Misappropriation: the decisions to approve the \nRelevant Loans and Drawdowns, and the subsequent steps to cover up what had \nhappened through the Ukrainian Proceedings, Asset Transfer and Tr"}

All the \navailable material demonstrates the reverse: he was fully involved throughout. It is to \nbe inferred from his refusal to give evidence, or to call any of his numerous associates \nwho were at the Bank at the time to do so, that any such evidence (if given honestly) \nwould have confirmed that position. \nAA2/15/88\n82 D1 D1-2’ S SHAREHOLDINGS IN THE BANK AND ASSOCIATED RIGHTS  \n(1) Shareholders’ meetings \n142 D1-2’s 90%+ shareholdings in the Bank and the rights that they conferred are addressed at \nBank Opening/¶¶101-102 {AA2/1/50}. \n143 The Bank’s shareholders held regular meetings between 2013-2016.85 Four points emerge: \n(1) D1-2 attended via nominees and voted their 90%+ shares unanimously in favour of \nevery resolution that was passed. Taking the minutes of the 25.4.14 meeting as an \nexample: ( i) D1-2 were two of the three shareholders who participated (the other was \nTriantal, a D1-2 company), as can be seen by the fact that the “ holders of 90.2116% of \nvoting shares ” were in attendance {E3/208.1/2}; and ( ii) each of the 22 resolutions \npassed was carried unanimously {E3/208.1/4-32}. One of the resolutions passed by \nD1-2 was to re-appoint themselves as two of the three members of the Bank’s \nSupervisory Board {E3/208.1/22}. \n(2) For each of the years 2012 to 2015, D1-2 reviewed and approved: ( i) the Bank’s annual \nreport, balance sheet and other financial statements;86 (ii) the auditor’s opinion and the \naudit report on the Bank’s consolidated financial statements; and ( iii) the consolidated \nfinancial statements themselves: see 31.12.12 {K1/243/15-20}, 31.12.13 \n{E3/208.1/14-18}, 31.12.14 {E9/95/24-27}, and 31.12.15 {E15/112.01/17-20}.  \n(3) D1-2 regularly agreed to use the profits (purportedly) made by the Bank over a \nprevious accounting period to increase the Bank’s authorised share capital (and hence \nthe number of shares they held in the Bank), including after D2 says that his \ninvolvement in (and support of) the Bank had ceased. There is no evidence that D1 \ncompensated D2 for his continued investment in the Bank.87  \n \n85  {K1/242} (12.2.13); {K1/243} (26.4.13); {E3/208.1/1} (25.4.14); {K1/245} (10.2.15); {K1/245} (10.7.15); \n{K1/247} (24-27.6.16); {E15/112.01} (26.8.16). \n86  i.e., taking the year ending 31.12.12 as an example, ( i) “Balance Sheet (Statement of Affairs) as of the end of day \n31.12.20 [1]2”; (ii) “Profit and loss statement for 2012 ”; (iii) “Statement of comprehensive income for 2012 ”; (iv) “Net Worth \nChanges Statement for 2012 ”; (v) “Cash flow statement for 2012 ”; (vi) “Consolidated Balance Sheet (Financial Statement) as \nof 31.12.2012 ”; (vii) “Consolidated statement of profit and loss for 2012 ”; (viii) “Consolidated statement of comprehensive \nincome for 2012 ”; (ix) “Consolidated statement of changes in equity for 2012 ”; and ( x) “Consolidated cash flow statement for \n2012 ” {K1/243/15-20}. \n87  See 2013 (UAH 1.454bn {K1/243/21-23}), 2014 (UAH 1.749bn {E3/208.1/19-20}), 2015 (profits were kept \nas retained earnings {E9/95/29}), 2016 (UAH 215m to share capital from profits, UAH 2.367bn to share \ncapital from retained earnings {E15/112.01/25-27}). \nAA2/15/89\n83 (4) D1-2 voted to approve and/or amend the Bank’s Charter, including amendments \nrelating to the Supervisory Board’s exclusive competence to bring legal pr"}

This \nis no more than common sense, but it was also confirmed by: \n(1) Ms Pogorelaya’s unchallenged written evidence that “ … the culture within the Bank was \nsuch that employees simply did not question or refuse to comply with instructions given by their \nsuperiors. … I simply carried out my instructions and tried not to think too deeply about it. Had I \nrefused to perform a task which I had been ordered to do, I was sure that I would have lost my job. \n…” (Pogorelaya/¶22 {B1/8/7-8}). \n(2) Mr Luchaninov’s written evidence that “ The primary function of BOK was to provide banking \nservices (such as loans) to the Bank’s so-called ‘strategic customers’, which I understood at the time \nwere companies within [D1] and [D2’s] wider business group. … my assumption at the time was \nthat Ms Gurieva would have received instructions directly from [D1] and [D2]” \n(Luchaninov/¶¶13-14 {B1/3/5}, confirmed in oral evidence at {Day9/55:9-18} and \nnot challenged save to make clear that – as he had always accepted – it was an \nassumption rather than from first-hand knowledge). \n(3) Ms Pakhachuk’s written evidence that “ … I am aware that the Bank has alleged that at least \nsome existing Bank employees were ‘loyal’ to [D1 and D2 ], and therefore not loyal to the new \nmanagement team. I entirely agree with that description. … ” (Pakhachuk/¶18 {B1/1/6}). Ms \nPakhachuk rejected D2’s counsel’s suggestion that Bank staff were only loyal to D1: \n“My Lord, both [D1] and [D2] are important political persons in Ukraine. Both they were and \nthey are. So this is the reason why I always speak of them jointly. … ” {Day13/3:10-13}. \n(4) Ms Rozhkova’s unchallenged written evidence that in an October 2016 meeting D1 \n“was at pains to make clear he would be able to reach [me and Gontareva ] even from Israel, saying \nthat ‘I have very long arms’. … [D1] looked at me, touching his stomach, and said that he was a \n‘hungry tiger in a cage, but the door is open – so you can leave’ and repeated what he had said earlier \nabout having long arms, but going further this time and saying that he would be able to find me \nanywhere. I had … no doubt that this was a physical threat …. ” (Rozhkova/¶218 {B1/5/54}). \n{AA2/15/303}\nAA2/15/90\n84 145 D1-2’s omnipresence and omnipotence are reflected in a number of documents (underlining \nadded, bold in original): \nKazantsev (BOK), complaining to another Bank employee:  “The company [Tekhspets, a Borrower]88 \nis a strategic client,89 the director of which is [Akimova], they could not sign a loan agreement under the \nprogram initiated by the shareholder of the bank due to the situation yesterday. … Please be sure to correct \nthe [Unified Client Database] for the specified customer; the lack of correct data jeopardises the timely \nimplementation of the shareholder programme.” \nKazantsev email of 26.6.13 {E2/40.1}90 \n \nGubanova (BOK)  “IV [the initials of a BOK employee], is P-24 with Ukrneft working properly??” \nScherbakova (BOK)  “I ASSOCIATE IV ONLY WITH ONE IV [ sc.

But this takes him nowhere: \nTekhspets was owned by both D1-2, and indeed D2 accepts that he had a nominal interest in it {A2/33/17}. \nAkimova is a nominee used by D1-2 ( e.g. she has three “ oral agreements ” with D2): {K4-A/2}. In fact, the use \nof the word ‘shareholder’ simply demonstrates that D1-2 were regarded as a single entity.  \n91  Sokolovskiy was the ‘Head of Internal Control and Fraud Management Division’. \nAA2/15/91\n85 Medvedev (Investment \nBusiness)  \n “No need to complicate matters. … when the Bank Group structure was \nformed, the Bank was specified as the controller, not IVK and GBB. And we \nknow why :) \nFormally : directly and indirectly each of them owns less than 50% of the Bank’s \ncapital; they do not have an agreement on joint share management; on the \nSupervisory Board they have 1/5 votes (they did have 1/3 votes).  \nThey do not have control ! It is impossible to prove this any further! \n…. \nAnd one more comment :) ... if you believe that IVK and GBB are the Bank’s \ncontrollers, then provide evidence of this ;)” \nJune 2015 emails about Bank control {E10/141/1-2}92 \nD2 D1-2’ S CONTROL OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD  \n146 The role of the Supervisory Board, and in particular its power to appoint / dismiss members \nof the Management Board, is addressed at Bank Opening/ ¶¶105-109 {AA2/1/52}. \n147 D1-2 seek (albeit without any evidence) to downplay their roles on the Supervisory Board. \nD1, for example, pleads that the Supervisory Board “ did not manage the Bank on a day to day \nbasis”, and that many significant decisions were made “ by executive officers of the Bank without  \n[his] involvement ” {A1/8/5} ( ¶7(2)(b)).

The \ndocuments show at least the following: \n(1) A meeting on 16.4.13 to approve an updated financial recovery programme is \nrecorded as having taken place between 10am and 11am: {K1/16}. \n(2) Further meetings held on the same topic were also recorded as having taken place at \nspecific times of the day: 13.6.13 (10-11am) {K1/21}; 20.3.14 (10.30am-12pm) \n{K1/41}; 11.4.14 (10.30am-12pm) {K1/51}; 22.5.14 (10-11am) {K1/56}; 5.8.14 (10-\n11am) {K1/62}; 21.10.14 (10-11am) {K1/66}; 10.2.15 (2-3pm) {K1/79}; 10.3.15 (3-\n4pm) {K1/82}; 7.4.15 (10-11am) {K1/90}. \n154 Further, D2’s abandoned trial evidence is inconsistent with the notion that he acted as “ a \nformal stamp of approval to motions proposed by the Bank’s management ” {AA4/1/38} ( ¶100.2(ii)). \nIn that evidence, D2 said that as a result of his appointment to the board of Evraz, then a \nFTSE 100 company, he learned that he could be “ held personally liable if I was found not to have \ndone my job properly ” and that other board members “ stressed ” “the importance of reviewing and \nunderstanding the papers that were provided to me in advance of each meeting ”; as a result  he “ looked \nmore closely at the documents I was asked to sign and asked more questions of Mr Dubilet ”{B2/11/14-\n15} (¶¶59-60). \n \n94  Section 1 is headed “ Increased level of capitalisation of the bank ”. It includes entries which read “ Increase in authorised \ncapital by UAH 4,000 million, of which UAH 3,345 million – due to additional shareholder contributions [;] and UAH 665 \nmillion – due to capitalisation of profits of 2014 ”, and “ attraction of subordinated debt in the amount of 4,576,064 thous. \nUAH ”. The “ Bank structures responsible for execution ” are said to be “ PrivatBank’s shareholders ”.  \n95  E.g. {K1/37}, {K1/76}, {K1/85}, {K1/100/2}, {K1/106/2}, {K1/111}, {K1/114}, {K1/115} \n{K1/122/2}, {K1/123/2-3}, {K1/124/2}, {K1/126/2}, {K1/174}, {K1/178}, {K1/193/2}, {K1/195/3}, \n{K1/197}, {K1/198}, {K1/200}. \nAA2/15/94\n88 155 Finally, D2’s assertion that the Supervisory Board was kept in the dark by the Management \nBoard is unreal: cp.

D2’s oral opening {Day7/13:4-6}). Quite apart from the overriding fact \nthat D2 was in constant contact with Dubilet, Novikov, Gurieva and other board members, \nD2’s (wholly unevidenced) submission falls apart when scrutinised: \n(1) D2 relies upon the NBU’s 2014 and 2016 Scheduled Inspection Reports ({Day7/13:1-\n6} and {AA4/1/44} (¶116)), found at {E4/276} (2014) and {E15/28} (2016).  \n(2) The 7-page covering letter by which the NBU’s 2014 report was sent to D2 on 27.3.15 \ncan fairly be described as excoriating: “ regulatory capital was negative ”; “The quality of the \nBank’s assets is low, while total credit risk is high ”; there were “ Significant credit concentrations \n(including with insiders), violating credit risk ratios and reducing regulatory capital ”; there were \n“High-amount loans … to newly created companies with almost no activity ”; “80% of the collateral \naccepted by the Bank … was rights to after-acquired goods to be delivered at a later date ”; and \n“Based on the foregoing it is proposed [that] the Bank’s Supervisory Board and Management Board \n[should ] review the Audit Report (enclosed) and take appropriate disciplinary action against persons \nresponsible for violations ” {E8/139/1-6}. \n(3) D2 cannot claim ignorance of the 2014 report: it was, as we have said, sent directly to \nhim on 27.3.15: {E8/139}. And this rather begs the questions: why didn’t D2 then \nput in place a more formal reporting system? And, even more importantly, why didn’t \nhe read the Management Board the riot act (or dismiss them or take other appropriate \n“disciplinary action ”96)? The (obvious) answer is this: because he and D1 were perfectly \nwell aware of precisely what the Bank’s senior management were doing, because they \nwere doing it pursuant to D1-2’s instruction.  \n(4) Indeed, rather than take steps to dismiss the Management Board and bring in new \nblood, D2 voted to re-appoint its members (Novikov, Dubilet, Gurieva, Yatsenko et \nal.) on 17.4.15 {K1/93} ( i.e. three weeks after he was sent the 2014 report).  \n156 But it gets worse. D1-2 as shareholders of the Bank consistently approved of the \nperformance of the Management Board. Strikingly, they did so one month after the NBU’s \n2014 report was sent to D2. The minutes of the shareholders’ meeting held on 27.4.15 state: \n“… the following resolution was adopted by the General Meeting of shareholders: … The \nwork of [the] Management Board in 2014 shall be acknowledged as satisfactory and in \naccordance with the purpose and direction of the Company’s activities …. \n \n96  Mr Alyoshin’s evidence that the Supervisory Board could have docked the salaries of Management Board \nmembers in accordance with Articles 130 and 136 of the Labour Code: Alyoshin4/¶31 ff {C9.7/1/14}. \nAA2/15/95\n89 … In 2014, … the Supervisory Board exercised management of financial flows and \n[supervised] the work of the Management Board and the Bank as a whole… \nDue to the established actions of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board, the Bank \nfulfils its obligations in time to the budget, shareholders, state and supervisory authorities…” \n{E9/95/20-21} \n157 The story is the just same, in relation to the NBU’s 2016 inspection: \n(1) The 2016 inspection report, found at {E15/28}, is as damning as its 2014 predecessor. \nThe NBU’s 27.7.16 seven-page covering letter (not sent directly to D2, as he was no \nlonger Supervisory Board chair but plainly something that would have come to his \nattention) referred to inter alia  related party transactions consuming 70.22% of the \nBank’s assets (or 807.38% of regulatory capital) {E15/28/2}; “ the practice of … issuing \nlarge amounts of loans to … companies with unprofitable and/or essentially non-existent operations ” \n(ibid.); “artificial risk minimisation from lending by a "}
{"start": 269500, "text": " NBU’s 27.7.16 seven-page covering letter (not sent directly to D2, as he was no \nlonger Supervisory Board chair but plainly something that would have come to his \nattention) referred to inter alia  related party transactions consuming 70.22% of the \nBank’s assets (or 807.38% of regulatory capital) {E15/28/2}; “ the practice of … issuing \nlarge amounts of loans to … companies with unprofitable and/or essentially non-existent operations ” \n(ibid.); “artificial risk minimisation from lending by a low-liquid pledge in the form of property rights \nto goods in doubtful contracts, the concentration of which in the collateral structure is … 57.19% ” \n(ibid.); and “ concealment by the Bank of transactions with related parties ” {E15/28/3}. In other \nwords, it found that the serious problems identified in the 2014 report had not been \nresolved by the Bank’s management; instead, the same malpractice had continued. \n(2) As noted above, the only thing the Supervisory Board did after receiving an NBU \nreport was (on 10.8.16) to tell the Management Board to implement the NBU’s \nrecommendations {K1/173}. Nobody was read the riot act, disciplined, sacked, sued, \nreported to the criminal authorities etc. \n(3) A shareholders’ meeting was held on 26.8.16, a month after the NBU’s report was \nproduced. The first substantive issue on the agenda97 was the performance of the \nManagement Board in 2015 {E15/112.01/9}. After a glowing report (“ active client base \n… increased by 5.6% by the end of 2015 ”, “new innovative technologies and payment services were \nintroduced ”, the Bank “ met the NBU’s requirements on liquidity regulatory indicators ”, “50.3% \nof depositors of Ukraine trusted their savings to  [the Bank ]” etc. {E15/112.01/9-11}), the \nshareholders unanimously resolved as follows: \n“The 2015 performance of the … Management Board be recognised as satisfactory and \nin line with the purpose and directions of the Company’s activities ….” \n{E15/112.01/12} \n(4) The shareholders were also happy to heap praise on the Bank’s management generally:  \n“Due to the coordinated actions of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board, \nthe Bank fulfils its obligations to depositors, the budget, shareholders, government and \n \n97  The fourth agenda item. \nAA2/15/96\n90 regulatory authorities. … The entire team of the Bank, according to the Supervisory \nBoard, deserves high appraisal and the Bank’s Management Board financial and \noperating performance report deserves approval” {E15/112.01/13}.  \n158 In short, D1-2 provided their full public support and backing to the management, \nnotwithstanding repeated serious concerns being raised by the NBU, in particular in 2014 \nand 2016. If it had been true that D1-2 did not know what was going on, they would have \ntaken decisive action when confronted with the catalogue of failings set out in the NBU’s \n2014 and 2016 reports. They did not; they lavished praise on their Management Board; and \nrepeatedly reappointed them. The only explanation for that is the one which is obvious from \nall the available evidence: the Management Board was doing what D1-2 told it to do. \nD3 D1-2’ S APPOINTMENT AND CONTROL OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD AND ECC \n(1) Appointment \n159 D1-2 used their control over the Supervisory Board to appoint people to the Management \nBoard who would do their bidding. For the most part, the ECC was staffed with \nManagement Board members too.

He also voted in favour of 129 of the Relevant Loans as a member \nof the ECC, and held a 0.38% interest in the Bank (8th largest shareholder) {K1/219/2}.  \n163 Yatsenko also has close links to D1-2, such that it is to be inferred that he reported to D1-\n2 and acted on their instructions on matters that concerned them: \n \n100  On occasion, other non-Management Board members sat on the ECC. Most approved between one and four \nRelevant Loans although some e.g. Oleksiy Pavlovtsev (Head of Department of Economic Security) and \nTatiana Movliav (Director of Centre for Trade Financing) had slightly more involvement. \n{AA2/15/42}\nAA2/15/98\n92 (1) Yatsenko had an extension on the ‘Black’: {K5-E/3.1/6}. \n(2) In March 2015, it was Yatsenko, Novikov and Pikush who asked Mr Luchaninov to \nwork out a plan for eliminating connections between D1-2 and 42 BOK clients (all \nBorrowers) identified by the NBU: see Section G5  below.  \n(3) On 22.4.16, Yatsenko emailed Novikov asking for assistance in producing documents \nrelating to two companies, one of which was Memento (the owner of Hotel Split): \n{E13/219}. This was as part of the Asset Transfer, in which Yatsenko was closely \ninvolved: see further {E14/309.1}. \n(4) In October-November 2016 Yatsenko was responsible for sending the various \niterations of the Transformation Plan to the NBU, and for answering questions the \nNBU’"}

They were \ndoubtless convened by D1-2 and these ex-Bank employees to discuss D1-2’s response \nto these proceedings (the WFO was served on 21.12.17 and D1-2’s jurisdiction \nchallenges were to be served on 9.3.18) (the “Geneva Meetings” ). \n(6) On 12.9.18, D1 sent Yatsenko five documents by WhatsApp {K5-A1/62/3}. They \nwere draft requests for mutual legal assistance sent by the Ukrainian authorities in \nrelation to an alleged fraud on the Bank to the Austrian, British, BVI, Cypriot and \nLuxembourgish authorities: {K5-B17/1} to {K5-B17/5}. D1 obviously trusted \nYatsenko not to reveal that D1 had obtained this material illegitimately. \n(7) In addition, eight messages between D1 and Yatsenko have been redacted on the basis \nthat they contain “ confidential information relating to the commercial affairs of companies ” {K5-\nA4/1/230} and six more on the basis that they concern “ political matters, causes, or \naffiliations ” {K5-A4/1/231}. \n \n101  {K5-A2/3/32} (D1 message to D2 at 12.37 on 14.2.18); {K5-A1/50/22} (D1 message to Novikov at 12:42); \n{K5-A1/62/2} (D1 message to Yatsenko, also at 12:42), {K5-A1/65/4} (D1 message to Gorokovsky, also at \n12:42).  \n102  See D1 WhatsApp to Yatsenko: “I will be waiting in Geneva on the 13th”, to which Yatsenko replies “Thank you, I \nwill be there”  {K5-A1/62/2}.  \n{AA2/15/185}\nAA2/15/99\n93 (8) On 22.2.21, Yatsenko was arrested in connection with a criminal investigation relating \nto large transfers of funds from the Bank to Ingosstrakh in December 2016 ( i.e. shortly \nbefore nationalisation). But that doesn’t begin to tell the story. In fact, and as explained \nat {Day15/46:10} - {Day15/54:8}: ( i) the Ukrainian prosecutor signed an arrest \nwarrant on 22.2.21; ( ii) Yatsenko received a tip-off and sought to flee Ukraine on a \nprivate jet bound for Vienna; but ( iii) the prosecutor got wind of his plan, had the \nplane turned around in mid-air, and arrested Yatsenko on the runway of the on the \nrunway of the Boryspil airport. Two aspects of this story are telling for present \npurposes: first, D2 sent D1 a press link regarding the incident the next day {K5-\nA1/10/2}, {K5-B3/161}; second the plane on which Yatsenko made his abortive \nescape attempt was leased by D1’s Windrose Airways.103 \n(9) Yatsenko was involved in correspondence with PwC regarding the financing (using \nthe Borrower companies Ribotto, Ortika and Prudis) of redevelopment works at \nHotel Split. See further Section F3  below. \n(10) Yatsenko provided two trial witness statement on behalf of D1 but was not ultimately \ncalled.  \n(b) Yuriy Pikush (General Deputy Chair Management Board; ECC Member) \n164 Pikush was the General Deputy Chair of the Management Board. He also, in his capacity as \nan ECC member, voted in favour of 129 of the Relevant Loans and signed 15 Relevant \nLoans on the Bank’s behalf.

He headed a retail banking division of the Bank, \nbut was also a member of the ECC and approved 129 Relevant Loans in this capacity. \nGorokhovsky also held a 0.38% interest in the Bank (5th largest shareholder): {K1/219}. \n167 Gorokhovsky again has close links to D1-2 and the proper inference is that he, too, would \nreport to and take instructions from them on matters that concerned them:  \n(1) Though not listed in the directories disclosed by D2, he had an extension on the \n‘Black’ in 2019 {K5-A1/66/9}. \n(2) Gorokhovsky attended the Geneva Meetings (with D1, D2, Novikov and Yatsenko) \non 13.2.18 – 14.2.18. \n(3) In June 2018, Gorokhovsky also attended a lunch with D1 and Novikov at a high-end \nrestaurant on the shores of Lake Geneva: {K5-A1/65/6} {K5-A1/50/63}. \n(4) In mid-2019, Gorokhovsky provided D1 with regular updates about IT difficulties \nbeing faced by the Bank ( e.g. “They tried to update the Cisc"}

Then I wrote a post and they cancelled the project. They are like blind kittens  …” \n(ibid.); “They are living through the storm all the time. It is like Cancer Stage 3. A little more and \nAA2/15/101\n95 the chemotherapy will stop helping ” – D1 enquired a week later “ How is the cancer patient? ” \n{K5-A1/65/17}). \n(5) On 25.1.19, Gorokhovsky says to D1 “ Good evening, should I make payment 10 ” {K5-\nA1/66/2}. D1 says “ no”. \n(6) Gorokhovsky flew with Dubilet, and members of his and Dubilet’s family, to Dnipro \nin June 2019 on D1’s private jet {K5-A1/19/5}. There is, in addition, evidence of a \nfriendly relationship between D1 and Gorokhovsky.104 \n(7) By 22.6.19 there was a business problem that Gorokhovsky has encountered when \nacting on behalf of D1-2 {K5-A1/66/9}: he wrote to D1 saying “ …[redacted personal \ndata] are not calming down. … if you don’t mind, I’ll talk everything over with GB, so as not to \ndisturb you. You obviously do not care about these trifles ”. Notably, D2 has disclosed no record \nof those discussions. \n(d) Chmona (Deputy Chair Management Board; ECC Member) \n168 Chmona was a Deputy Chair of the Management Board and the head of the Bank’s \nBudgeting Department. She also sat on the ECC, and approved 126 of the Relevant Loans \nin this capacity. Chmona held a 0.28% interest in the Bank (10th largest shareholder): \n{K1/219/2}. Chmona has many close links to D1-2 and the proper inference is that she \nreported to, and took instructions from, D1-2: \n(1) Chmona had various extensions on the Black – initially in Dnipro and Cyprus {K5-\nE/2.1/4}, later adding extensions in Geneva and Riga {K5-E/3.1/6}. Indeed, \nfollowing nationalisation Chmona went to work for D1-2 in their Geneva office \n(requiring D1’s consent to work for the day in Riga: “ Igor …, can I work in Riga on \nMonday – Tuesday? Will be in the office on Wednesday morning ” {K5-A1/13/9}). \n(2) From  c. 2011, Chmona was the “ responsible person ” (or one of two responsible people) \nfor budgets and other documents relating to a number of D1-2’s assets including \nGeorgian Manganese, Stalmag, Feral, Chemstar, NZF, SZF, ZZF, MGOK, OGOK, \nand DniproAZOT: see {E1/82} {E1/83P}.  \n(3) D2’s limited disclosure of text messages from 2011 shows that he approved \npayment/budgeting proposals put forward by Chmona in relation to the D1-2 asset \n \n104  On 4.2.18 Gorokhovsky told D1 “ Happy Birthday :) Destroy all enemies and never change. You are a wonderful person! ” \n{K5-A1/65/4}; on 28.6.18, D1 and Gorokovsky exchanged messages about football {K5-A1/65/9}; and D1 \nsent Gorokhovsky memes, comic videos and festive messages throughout the chat {K5-A1/65/9-18}. \nAA2/15/102\n96 empire: on 6.12.11, Markova sent D2 a text saying: “ For 06-14/12 from Chmona USD \n15.381 (three tranches) for GM (financing in accordance with the budget by repayment of Abendale \ndebt to GM) ” to which D2 responds “ Ok” {K5-E/1/1}. It is to be inferred that \nChmona performed this role throughout 2013-2016 (and thereafter) and not just for \nthe period for which messages have been disclosed. \n(4) An email from Dubilet dated 7.11.13, addressed to D2 with a subject line of “ financing ”, \nstates that “ Chmona said that you gave the command to increase the funding limit to 17.5 thousand \nper month. Please acknowledge it ” {E2/190}. D2 has failed to disclose records o"}

It is to be inferred that \nChmona performed this role throughout 2013-2016 (and thereafter) and not just for \nthe period for which messages have been disclosed. \n(4) An email from Dubilet dated 7.11.13, addressed to D2 with a subject line of “ financing ”, \nstates that “ Chmona said that you gave the command to increase the funding limit to 17.5 thousand \nper month. Please acknowledge it ” {E2/190}. D2 has failed to disclose records of any \ncommunications through which his “ command ” was issued: the Court should infer that \n“financing ” in this period was the subject of oral discussion between D2 and Chmona, \nor that the records of those discussions have been withheld or destroyed. \n(5) Moving forward to 2015-2018, Chmona regularly sought and received D1’s consent \nfor the making of payments around D1-2’s asset empire: {K5-A1/11/2}; {K5-\nA1/12/2}; {K5-A1/13/2}; {K5-A1/14/2}. By way of example: \nChmona  “Igor Valerievich, payments for 21.10.2015: \nNZF: UAH 14,631.7 thous … including: coke 9,663.4; forwarding 2,000.0l coal \n1,464.0; PPE powder 706.5; … lime 251.3;  [detailed information is then given in \nrelation to D1-2’s ZZF, OGOK, MGOK, TGOK, Azot and KZhRK assets ].” \nD1 “OK” \nD1 WhatsApp exchange with Chmona on 21.10.15 {K5-A1/11/3-4}  \n(6) In total, messages concern the financing of at least 19 assets, of which D1 and D2 \nboth admit interests in 14 (with D1 admitting an interest in a further asset, and neither \nadmitting interests in the remaining four). Further detail on these companies is \nprovided at Appendix C7 . \n(7) Other messages of note show that ( i) Chmona performed a wide-ranging role for D1, \nattending to licensing issues with the KZhRK mine {K5-A1/13/10} and a street \nlighting problem that had been raised with D1 by a Rabbi {K5-A1/13/3}; and ( ii) D1 \nand Chmona have a relationship of some familiarity, exchanging New Year wishes \n{K5-A1/13/2} {K5-A1/13/10}.  \n169 Standing back, the fact that a member of the Bank’s executive management spent her time \nsending detailed text messages seeking consent for the making of on occasion  de minimis  \npayments around D1-2’s corporate empire is a striking indication of the control that D1-2 \nexercised over the Bank. Hundreds of further messages were sent by Melnikova, an \n{AA2/17/61}\nAA2/15/103\n97 employee of the Budgeting Department, and Markova, an employee of the Cyprus branch \n(see ¶178 below). These messages bear out Mr Luchaninov’s (unchallenged) observation that \n“[a]long with BOK, the purpose of the Budgeting Business was to keep [D1-2’s ] businesses operating ” \n{B1/3/6} (¶18). \n(e) Shmalchenko (Deputy Chair Management Board; sometime ECC Member) \n170 Shmalchenko was a Deputy Chair of the Management Board and its Director of Treasury \n{AA1/5/11}. She voted in favour of the three Relevant Loans to the Cypriot Borrowers as \npart of the ECC ( e.g. {F1/8/7}). Shmalchenko had an 0.19% interest in the Bank (15th largest \nshareholder): {K1/219/2}. Her connections with D1-2 (from which it is to be inferred that \nshe would report to, and take instructions from, them on matters concerning them) are \ndemonstrated by the following: \n(1) Shmalchenko was part of the Bank’s attempts from July 2015 onward to reduce the \nnumber of related parties recognised by the NBU by procuring changes to beneficial \nowners and directors. Mr Luchaninov’s unchallenged evidence is that “[ f]rom the Bank’s \nManagement Board, Ms Shmalchenko was responsible for coordinating the business units and liaising \nwith the NBU [in relation to the 165 companies ]” {B1/3/16} (¶66). She was also involved \nin the Bank’s response to the NBU’s enquiries about the Asset Transfer: see On \n15.6.16, Yatsenko’s email Shmalchenko (and Ponomarev, Gurieva’s deputy in BOK): \n{E14/194}, {E14/195}. \n(2) Shmalchenko remained in business with other members of the Management Board \npost-nationalisation: as at October 2020, the six shareholders of companies called \n"}

See e.g. {E17/166.2}, {E17/177.1} \n{E17/177.2/7}. Various similar emails passed between the same four individuals over \nthe next month: {E17/180.5} {E17/180.6} {E17/180.7} {E17/180.8}.  \n(f) Kryzhanovskiy (Deputy Chair Management Board; ECC Member) \n171 Kryzhanovskiy was a Deputy Chair of the Management Board and Head of the Bank’s \nSecurity Service {AA1/5/6}. He would not have held this position unless he was a trusted \nconfidante of D1-2 (reporting to, and taking instructions from, them on matters concerning \nAA2/15/104\n98 them). He voted in favour of 119 Relevant Loans as a member of the ECC ( e.g. {F46/9}). \nSee also:  \n(1) On 12.2.15, the NBU issued Request 27 {E7/307.2}. The Bank’s immediate response \nwas to initiate an enquiry into the leakage of information about the Misappropriation \nfrom within the Bank (and not about the Misappropriation itself). Thus, Mr \nLuchaninov, acting on Pikush’s instructions, directs Kryzhanovskiy (and his deputy, \nSokolovskiy) to “ investigate the facts of disclosure of bank secrecy that led to publication of bank \nsecrets in the  [NashiGroshi ] Article ” {E7/307.4/2}. \n(2) Kryzhanovskiy is thereafter copied into the chains of emails between Mr Luchaninov, \nPikush, Sokolovskiy and others regarding the NashiGroshi leak investigation \n{E7/307.4}. His deputy’s initial findings identified two employees of interest to the \nsecurity team {E7/310/2}. See Section L  below. \n(g) Korotina (Member of Management Board; Chief Accountant) \n172 Korotina was a member of the Bank’s pre-nationalisation Management Board, as well as its \nChief Accountant {AA1/6/2}. She had a 0.19% interest in the Bank {K1/219/2} (13th \nlargest shareholder), and was another to toe the D1-2 line ( i.e. it is to be inferred that she \nreported to, and took instructions from, them on matters concerning them): \n(1) On 2.3.15, Korotina engaged in a Skype conversation with Dubilet regarding \nreduction of the Bank’s loan portfolio {K6/64/5}. At 17:00, Dubilet states “ We will \nneed to show the reduction to the portfolio to legal entities. Think about how to transfer to the off-\nbalance credit deposit sheet. By how much can this reduce the portfolio? ”. Korotina provides some \nsuggestions, to which Dubilet responds “ I am interested in reducing the portfolio of loans of \nlegal entities. Think about it with Yatsenko. Talk to him ”. Korotina responds “ ok”. \n(2) On 8.10.15, Koryak sent Rokoman a transcript of a Skype chat with Korotina, \ndiscussing how to hide information from the NBU {E11/262}. In a piece of very \ncreative accountancy, Korotina proposes refinancing “ 10 million every day … with \ndifferent amounts of 5 million, 8 million, and 12 million ” {E11/262/2}. \n(3) On 30.9.16 ( i.e. shortly after the Asset Transfer), Korotina participated in a Skype \nconversation with various Bank employees {K6/102.1}. After a reference to the \n{AA2/15/303}\nAA2/15/105\n99 “reversal on the deal with Borivage’s property ”,105 Korotina explains that “ Good loans without \noverdue are needed ”, “It is better to grant a new loan ”, “It is necessary to repay overdue loans ” and \n“Maybe let’s grant loans to other clients to repay the ove"}

After a reference to the \n{AA2/15/303}\nAA2/15/105\n99 “reversal on the deal with Borivage’s property ”,105 Korotina explains that “ Good loans without \noverdue are needed ”, “It is better to grant a new loan ”, “It is necessary to repay overdue loans ” and \n“Maybe let’s grant loans to other clients to repay the overdue ones ” {K6/102.1/3}. \n(h) Other bank staff \n173 There are many other Bank staff who can be demonstrated to be loyal to D1-2 (and hence \nwhere it is proper to infer that they reported to, and took instructions from, D1-2 on matters \nconcerning them). They include the following:  \n174 Olexander Vityaz  was a Deputy Chair of the Management Board (though he did not sit on \nthe ECC): e.g. {K1/36}. He held a 0.2% interest in the Bank (11th largest shareholder): \n{K1/219/2}. On 27.4.17, Dubilet messaged D1 to say “ Vityaz will arrive in Israel on Friday \n12.05 at 12:30 a.m. Ready to get to work in the morning. The Kazakhs from GB will also arrive there. \nWill depart on 16.05 in the evening… ” {K5-A1/17/9}. \n175 Dmytro Dubilet , Alexander’s son, sat on the Bank’s Management Board but not its ECC: \ne.g. {K1/36}. He held a 0.13% interest in the Bank (19th largest shareholder): {K1/219/2}. \nAs might be expected, he followed in his father’s footsteps in terms of loyalty to D1-2: ( i) \nhe was an attendee at the lunch that his father held with D1-2 on 15.7.19 {K5-A2/5/32}, \n(ii) he needed D1’s permission before he could post things relating to the Bank on social \nmedia {K5-A1/17/15}, and ( iii) he provided PR support to D1-2 {K5-A1/17/22}. \n176 Alexey Ponomarev  was Gurieva’s deputy in BOK {AA1/5/9} and a member of the ECC \n(e.g. {F7/43}). Like his immediate boss he was loyal to D1-2. For example, on 17.5.17, \nDubilet told D1: “ Alexey Ponomarev is aligned. His total revenue [sc. income ] per month was USD \n$5,400 ” {K5-A1/17/11}.  \n177 Svetlana Melnikova  was an employee of the Bank’s Budgeting Department, headed by \nChmona. Her job might more accurately be described as budgeting for parts of D1-2’s \ncorporate empire, as explained at Bank Opening/¶¶135-136 {AA2/1/62-63} and at \n{Day14/11:8} - {Day14/18:12} ( e.g. asking D1 to approve the purchase of a £13,000 car). \nThe most important message Melnikova sent to D1 sought and received permission to pay \n“Primecap tax and soc. insur. ” {K5-A1/42/4}. She was also identified as the initiator of several \n \n105  Ms Rozhkova’s unchallenged evidence ({B1/5/47}, ¶186) is that the Borivazh grain terminal, which had been \ntransferred to the Bank as part of the Asset Transfer (and was purportedly worth UAH 8 billion – more than \na quarter of the value of the entire Asset Transfer) had disappeared from the Bank’s balance sheet following \nthe IMF disbursing further funds to Ukraine – and it turned out that the terminal had never in fact been \ntransferred in the first place. See also the November 2016 EY report {E16/179/21} and {E16/179/56-57}. \nAA2/15/106\n100 budget approval requests sent to D2 (she is identified in these documents as “ MSV ” – see \n¶76(6) above).  \n178 Marina Markova  was an employee of the Cypriot branch. Post-nationalisation she moved \nto Primecap and then Sunaltezza. As explained at Bank Opening/¶¶137-138 and 349 \n{AA2/1/63} and {AA2/1/145-146} and {Day14/32:7} - {Day14/42:20}, she exchanged \ntext messages with D2 in 2011-12; continued to correspond with D2 at the time of and after \nnationalisation; and has continued to perform a treasury function in relation to D1-2’s \ncorporate empire (sending bank balances for over 20 companies/individuals, including \nGrizal, Sanderlyn, Versala and D2 himself to D1, on a daily basis; and even asking D1 to \napprove her holiday {K5-A1/40/19}, {K5-A1/40/47}).  \n179 Alexey Kazantsev  worked at the Bank from 2002 until 4.4.18.

He was a BOK employee \nover the period of the Misappropriation, holding the position of Deputy Head of the \nCustomer Credit Department {AA1/6/4}, and was heavily involved in the day-to-day \noperation of the Misappropriation, being the keeper of the eponymous Kazantsev \nSpreadsheet . He gave written evidence in 2018 in support of D1’s set aside application \n{H2/10} but has not been tendered as a witness for trial. (Similarly, BOK’s Olga Koryak \n(Head of Legal Support in BOK) and Maxim Pugach (the Deputy Head of IT) both also \ngave evidence for D1 in 2018 {H2/7} and {H2/6} but again were not called to give evidence \nat trial – despite D1’s complaints that the Bank did not tender enough witnesses from its in-\nhouse legal function, as to which see further below.) \nD4 PARTICULAR EXAMPLES OF D1-2’ S DE FACTO CONTROL OF THE BANK \n(1) D2 Emails  \n180 Despite D2’s profoundly inadequate disclosure and his admitted deletion of emails at the \ntime ( Section E2 ) there are nonetheless a number of surviving emails which further show \nD2’s close involvement in and detailed knowledge of the Bank’s business: \n(1) On 21.2.13 , Dubilet forwarded D2 a translation of an analysis prepared by VTB \nCapital relating to the Bank’s US$175m loan participation note public offering and \ndescribing the Bank’s use of “ traders ” to disguise related party lending {E1/254.01}: \nsee ¶76(5) above. D2 simply replied “ Okay ”: he clearly knew all about his Bank’s \nrelated-party lending to his companies.  \n(2) On 26.2.13 , and as explained at ¶76(3) above, Dubilet emailed D2 requesting that D2 \n“give instructions ” and “ confirm the size of lines for 2013, for monthly payments to the heads of \n{AA2/15/132}\nAA2/15/107\n101 strategic enterprises ” {E1/260/1-2}; those “ heads of strategic enterprises ” were managers of \nD1/D2’s companies; and D2 reduced Maksimenko’s credit limit but otherwise \napproved Dubilet’s request.106 D2’s suggestion that this correspondence related to \nD2’s “ own assets ” and has nothing to with control of the Bank ({Day3/15:1} - \n{Day3/16:16} and {Day3/51:1} - {Day3/52:10}) is hopeless.  D2’s reply shows him \ngiving direct instructions to Dubilet about how much the Bank should lend to the \nmanagers of his (and D1’s) companies.  \n(3) See, to similar effect, an email sent by Dubilet on 7.11.13  and intended for D2 (though \nsent to D2’s wife by mistake): “ Dear Gennadi …, Chmona said that you gave the command \nto increase the funding limit to 17.5 thousand per month. Please acknowledge it. ” {E2/190}. \n(4) Between 16-22.3.13 , Novikov and Dubilet provided six updates to D2 in relation to \nthe Cypriot financial crisis and, specifically the steps that the Bank was taking in \nresponse to measures taken by the Cypriot government: {E1/274.1}, {E1/275}, \n{E1/275.01}, {E1/275.2}, {E1/275.3}, and {E1/281.1}. \n(5) On 1.10.13 , Novikov sent Dubilet an email with the subject line “ Subdebt 1.3 billion \nUAH – for approval by GB ” {E2/130.7}. Over seven paragraphs Novikov lays out a \ndetailed scheme which appears to result in UAH 1.3bn sitting in accounts of nine \ncompanies linked with D1-2’s KSZ project (including Songo, through which D1 says \nhe accidentally acquired an interest in PBC: see Section C  above) to be treated as if it \nwere subordinated debt paid to the Bank. The mechanics of the scheme are complex, \nand probably designed artificially to inflate the Bank’s balance sheet.

But what is \nimportant about this email is that it was “ for approval by GB ” – because D2 was involved \nin the minutiae of the Bank’s financial operation.  \n(6) On 4.3.14 , D2 forwarded Dubilet an email chain in which Sberbank enquires about \npurchasing a portfolio of consumer loans/credit card debts from the Bank’s Moscow \nsubsidiary, Moskomprivatbank {E3/101.1}.  \n(7) Mid-afternoon on 31.3.14 , Novikov sent an email to D2 with the heading “ RG Trans \n– PrivatBank Loan – schedule approval ” {E3/167.1}. The body of the email states: “ I am \nsending the Schedule for repayment of the RG-Trans loans, broken down by month. … Please \napprove ”. The Schedule itself shows how RG-Trans’ US$28.2m loan was going to be \nrepaid on a monthly basis between July 2014 and June 2018. The proposal appears to \n \n106  The figures in the columns “ Line size in 2013 (in USD) ” and “ Limit for 2013 per month (USD) ” are higher in \nDubilet’s email to D2 {E1/260/2} as against D2’s response to Dubilet {E1/260.1/2}. \n{AA2/15/42}\nAA2/15/108\n102 have involved the loan being transferred from the Bank (or possibly the Bank’s \nRussian subsidiary) to PrivatBank Latvia. Thereafter: \n(a) At almost 7pm on 31.3.14, Gninenko (Primecap) emailed Trubakov (the Chair \nof PrivatBank Latvia, later a Sunaltezza employee), copying Novikov, setting \nout the same repayment schedule as had been sent to D2 earlier that afternoon \n{E3/170.1}.  \n(b) Novikov responded a couple hours later: “ I confirm that the schedule is agreed ” (ibid.).  \n(c) But Trubakov was nervous (presumably he did not want PrivatBank Latvia to \ntake on bad lending). He asked whether Shmalchenko knew about the schedule, \nand explained that “ I will not extend without ” security from the Bank.  \n(d) An irked Novikov responded by forwarding Trubakov’s email to Shmalchenko, \ncopying Dubilet, and saying “ Please arrange for confirmation for PB Latvia. There is \nagreement on the repayment schedule with GB. ”  {E3/167.1}.  \n(e) Three points follow from all this: ( i) Novikov required D2’s consent to vary \neven comparatively modest lending granted by the Bank/a subsidiary; ( ii) once \nthat consent had been provided, the issue was settled – the Bank was going to \ngive PB Latvia whatever confirmation it needed to agree to the extended \nrepayment schedule; and ( iii) whilst initially hesitant to do so, Novikov \neventually used D2’s name as he knew that would be sufficient to get Trubakov \nto do as he was told.  \n(8) On 11.3.15 , Allan Green107 emailed D2’s gbbmail.com address {E8/75/2}. He sought \nD2’s help in arranging the transfer of €3m to Cuba. D2 forwarded the email to Dubilet \nwithin an hour of receipt {E8/75}. Dubilet treated it seriously, forwarding it to \nMorgachov within 10 minutes, observing that it was “[ t]he question of [D2]”, and asking \nwhether the payment could be made “ without consequences for the bank ” (ibid.).  \n(9) On 1.9.16 , D2 emailed Dubilet under the subject line “[ t]hey are proposing this structure ” \nwith an attachment setting out the proposed structure and security (over two business \ncentres in central Kyiv) in respect of a loan to be granted by the Bank: {E15/131.1} \n{E15/131.2}.

Again, this is \nD2 engaging in the Bank’s day-to-day operations. \n(2) Other instances of D2 involvement \n181 Given D2’s case that he somehow distanced himself from the Bank (not a claim D1 \nsupports), the Bank provides a chronology of further instances of D2’s involvement with \nthe Bank and its executives in Appendix D1 . \n182 Taking by way of illustration, the period 3.2.14 to 1.6.14 (during the only active phase of the \nMisappropriation for which D2 has disclosed phone records): \n(1) D2 spoke with Dubilet 108 times. \n(2) D2 spoke with Novikov 120 times and D1 155 times. \n(3) D2 must also have communicated with Dubilet, Novikov, D1 and others about the \nBank face-to-face, by WhatsApp/SMS, Black etc.  \n(4) D2 had email contact with Dubilet and Novikov about the Bank’s Russian subsidiary, \nthe Bank’s issuance of Eurobonds and a repayment schedule for US$26m loan. \n(5) D2 chaired 20 Supervisory Board meetings, and must have received and read papers \nin connection with the same ( e.g. the updated recovery plan approved at the meeting \nheld between 10.30am and 12pm on 20.3.14 {K1/41}). \n(6) D2 gave instructions for his nominee to vote his shareholding at the general meeting \nheld on 25.4.14, which ( inter alia ) approved the Bank’s 2013 accounts. \n(7) D2 and Dubilet sent the NBU detailed letters explaining the Bank’s parlous situation \nand asking for stabilisation loans. \n(8) D2 signed repayment schedules for two NBU stabilisation facilities in the amount of \nUAH 3.5bn.  \n(9) D2 agreed that the Stadium (in which he had a 45.5% interest) could be pledged to \nthe NBU as collateral for those loans. \n{AA2/18}\nAA2/15/110\n104 (3) NBU Stabilisation Loans  \n183 Between February 2014 and April 2015, the Bank sought and received extensive financial \nassistance from the NBU. In total, at least 10 stabilisation loans were granted with an overall \nvalue of c. UAH 16bn (the “Stabilisation Loans” ).108 \n184 D2 was closely involved in the Stabilisation Loan process, much of which took place after \n1.7.14 (when he says his role became “ purely formal ” {AA4/1/43} ( ¶114)). Through his \nengagement in that process, it is obvious that he was entirely familiar with the precarious \nstate of the Bank’s finances. In particular: \n(1) D2 and Dubilet wrote joint letters/emails to the NBU requesting the grant of \nStabilisation Loans, asking for the amendment of their terms, offering to provide \nsecurity in support, describing difficulties faced by the Bank ( e.g. “most borrowers are \nasking for extension of the loan debt repayment term due to reduction of cash flows and working \ncapital ” {E4/255}), giving assurances that the Bank’s regulatory capital would be \nincreased etc. In total, 15 letters of this type are found in the parties’ disclosure, nine \nof them sent after 1.7.14.109 They are summarised in the D2 Chronology at Appendix \nD1.  \n(2) Though each loan was signed on the Bank’s behalf by Dubilet, the NBU required both \nDubilet and D2 to sign every “ loan repayment schedule ” (found at Appendix 1 to each \nagreement). Taking the first Stabilisation Loan of 2014 as an example, D2 signed to \nconfirm that the Bank would make repayments of UAH 83.34m each month between \nMarch 2014 and February 2015: {E3/172.1/9}. In total, D2 signed nine loan \nrepayment schedules confirming repayments with a total value of UAH 21.091bn, six \nof them after 1.7.14.110 As for the letters, it is implausible that he should have \npersonally signed these confirmations without understanding why it was necessary for \nthe Bank to take on such significant additional liab"}

By way of example, on 4.3.15 D2 \nsigned a revised loan repayment schedule which deferred repayment of UAH 1.1bn \nuntil 10.6.15 {E18/205}. There are nine examples of such schedules in the trial \nbundle, and at least 50 more in the parties’ disclosure: see Appendix D1 . \n(4) Security was granted over assets in which D1 and D2 had an interest in support of the \nStabilisation Loans. Importantly, much of this security was posted after 1.7.14: \n(a) 26.5.14 : security was granted in favour of the NBU over the Stadium, owned \n54.5%/45.5% by D1/D2 ({E3/255.1} and {E12/176.1/3} row 16). \n(b) 5.12.14 : security was granted over Borivazh, in which D1-2 each admit a 17.5% \ninterest: {J2/3/95} (D1 asset 69); {J4/5/50} (D2 asset 48, which disclosure \nexplains that this asset is pledged “ under a loan agreement dated 5 December 2014 \nbetween [the Bank ] and the NBU ”). \n(c) 6.3.15 : security was granted over Aerobud {E12/176.1/3} rows 26 and 27 , \nowned 37.25%/62.75%: between D1 and D2: {J2/3/42} (D1 asset 38); \n{J4/5/138} and {J4/5/158}(D2 assets 121 and 157). \n(d) 13.3.15, 27.3.15, 10.4.15 : security was granted over aircraft held by Goiania, \nTeide and Penny Lane {E12/176.1/5}, {E13/76.2/2}.

He says: “ In case of immaterial deviation \n… from this schedule, we received confirmation from the shareholders that it was possible to convert the \nsubordinated debt in the amount of UAH 5.5 billion. In addition, Mr Kolomoisky confirmed the \nintroduction of equity capital in the amount of UAH 5.6 bln in 2018 and UAH 4.4 bln in 2019. ” \n(emphasis added) \n Anischenko sends Novikov an email \ncommenting on the manner by which \ncertain of D2’s 65 real estate interests are \nheld, with a view to including some of them \nin the Asset Transfer (as was later to \nhappen): { E12/215 } {E12/216 }. \n4.2.16 \n- \n8.2.16 D1 executes a letter to the NBU \nconfirming that he would contribute \nUAH 10bn of private property to the \nBank in 2018-19 { E12/236 }. \nD1 signs an updated letter on 8.2.16, in \nwhich he also says “ As a member of the \nSupervisory Board … I assure that from 1.3.16 \nthrough 31.12.20 the loan repayments will be \nmade from the list of large concentrations, on \naverage, totalling at least UAH \n1,293,000,000 … monthly ” {E12/256 } \n{E12/255}.  \nc.

D1 makes it clear to Ms Rozhkova that “ he \nwould need to check with [D2] before he could agree \nto various points ”: Rokhkova1/ ¶181 \n{B1/5/46 }. Ms Rozhkova confirmed this in \noral evidence when challenged by D2’s \ncounsel: “ … This kind of discussion [about the \nRestructuring Plan ] took place and Mr \nKolomoisky, a lot of times, referred that he need to \nnegotiate with Mr Bogolyubov ” {Day9/16:18-\n20}. \n \nD2 meets Marangos twice in London, on \n22.1.16 and 23.2.16, probably in connection \nAA2/15/113\n107 Date D1 involvement D2 involvement \nwith the extraction of assets from D2’s \ntrusts for the purposes of the Asset \nTransfer: {K5-A3/7L/46} {K5-\nA3/7L/48}.

He also sends her a \nnumber of text messages {K5-A1/54/1-\n4} (e.g. on 16.8.16 sending a list of petrol \nstations, saying: “ If the aforesaid petrol filling \nstations fail, we will replace them with others ”, \nand “ at 1.45 we sent the data on 12 petrol \nfilling stations ”) {K5-A1/54/3}{K5-\nB15/3}. \n2.9.16  Sergei Distergov (Chairman of the Hotel \nSplit companies) emails D2.

As \nset out in Bank Opening/¶¶400-413 {AA2/1/165-171}, D1 and D2 controlled and \nimplemented the Transformation: ( i) they gave personal undertakings to restructure the \nBank’s corporate credit portfolio; ( ii) the NBU and EY were told that the New Borrowers \nwould “ take over ” the businesses of “ donor companies ”, all of which were D1-2 assets; ( iii) they \nowned and/or controlled the New Borrowers; ( iv) the Transformation was implemented by \ntheir lieutenants in BOK; and ( v) they gave instructions to release the Share Pledges granted \nover shares in their companies (and refused to give any instructions for new pledges to be \nexecuted as security for the New Loans). \nD5 POST-NATIONALISATION CONDUCT  \n188 Given D2’s wholly inadequate disclosure of his communications with D1, Novikov, Dubilet \nand others during the period of Misappropriation, the Bank has focussed on post-\nnationalisation documents, of which some was finally extracted. D2’s response to this is to \nsay that his “ conduct and relationships post-Nationalisation do not provide any reliable basis for inferring ” \nthat he was involved in the Misappropriation: D2 Opening/ ¶125 {AA4/1/46}. \n189 This is untenable. The documents show that D2’s decades-long relationships with D1, \nNovikov and Dubilet (and with many other former insiders at the Bank) continued after \nnationalisation, and continued to be as close as they ever were. There is absolutely no \nevidence that anything changed as between D2 and D1, Novikov, Dubilet and the other \nBank insiders, even after the Bank brought this claim and set out the facts of the \nMisappropriation in detail. That conduct is impossible to reconcile with the contention now \nadvanced by D2’s lawyers on his behalf that there was extensive improper activity at the Bank \nundertaken by these same people. The fact that D2 continued to share offices, dinners and \nWhatsApps with all of these individuals without any hint of recrimination is explicable only \non the basis that D2 directed the fraudulent activity at the Bank. \n190 We have addressed much of D2’s post-nationalisation conduct above. As set out there, post \nnationalisation D2 ( i) maintained his umbilical relationship with D1; ( ii) maintained his close \nrelationship with Novikov; ( iii) continued to use the services of Primecap; ( iv) employed – \nvia Sunaltezza – 11 PBC nominees as well as former Cyprus branch employees (Markova, \nMorgach"}

None of that post-nationalisation conduct is consistent with \nD2’s new case – advanced by counsel – that it was the Management Board, BOK, Primecap \nand PBC who perpetrated the fraud on D1-2’s Bank without his knowledge. \nD6 THE DEEDS OF WAIVER AND INDEMNITY  \n191 According to D2, by Re-Re-Amendment to his Defence on 22.6.22: ( i) D2 and D1 made an \noral agreement on 1.7.14 for D1 to purchase D2’s shares in the Bank: ( ii) thereafter, D2’s \n“involvement [in the Bank’s activities ] was even more limited ” and he “ exercise [d] his vote as a shareholder \nand role on the Supervisory Board on [D1’s] instruction ”; and ( iii) D1-2’s agreement was formalised \nthrough a series of deeds of waiver/indemnity in May/June 2015 (the “Purported 2015 \nWaivers” ): {A1/18/11} ( ¶26A). We address this argument below. \n(1) The July 2014 oral agreement \n192 Given that D2 has declined to offer any evidence of his alleged oral agreement, that should \nbe the end of the matter. But the Bank can go further:  \n(1) On 29.3.22, the Court made a specific disclosure order requiring D2 to “ … procure \nthat his solicitors conduct reasonable searches for, and disclose … all documents relating to the \nnegotiation and conclusion of the July 2014 Agreement (including without limitation meeting notes, \nemails, Instant Messages …).” {A6/80/2} (¶3(a)). Despite this, and with the sole \nexception of reference to a July 2014 agreement in the Purported 2015 Waivers, no \ndocuments whatsoever have been disclosed supporting the notion that there was a \nJuly 2014 oral agreement. \n(2) If D2 had been “ voting his shares in PrivatBank and acting as Chairman at the sole direction of \n[D1]” {E9/172L/5} between 1.7.14 and 12.5.15, there would be some record of this \n(e.g. when he chaired Supervisory Board meetings, when he wrote to the NBU, when \nhe signed schedules to Stabilisation Loans etc.). But there is none. \n(3) It is elementary that, if a party wishes to rely on an oral agreement, he must give basic \nparticulars: see PD16/ ¶7.4 (“ the [pleading ] should set out the contractual words used and state \nby whom, to whom, when and where they were spoken ”). But there is none of that either.  \n(4) In his own abandoned trial evidence, D1 denied that any agreement was struck \nbetween D1 and D2 in 2014: “[ D2] and I started discussions on how to split our joint assets, \nbut we did not reach any agreement in this regard ” {B2/1/17} (¶35) (emphasis supplied). \n193 D2’s case regarding the July 2014 oral agreement should therefore be rejected.  \nAA2/15/118\n112 (2) The Purported 2015 Waivers \n194 There are six relevant documents here: \n(1) An executed Deed of Indemnity and Waiver between D1 and D2 dated 12.5.15 \n{E9/172L} (the “12.5.15 Waiver & Indemnity” ). \n(2) Four executed Deeds of Waiver between D2 and ( i) D1 (dated 12.6.15) {E10/28}, ( ii) \nDubilet (dated 22.6.15) {E10/91}, ( iii) Novikov (dated 29.5.15) {E9/258} and ( iv) \nTriantal (dated “ …….. 2015 ”) {E7/182}.  \n(3) A draft Deed of Waiver between D2 and the Bank {E9/247.6}.  \n195 There are four key points to make about these documents. \n196 First, and most impo"}
{"start": 329000, "text": "re: \n(1) An executed Deed of Indemnity and Waiver between D1 and D2 dated 12.5.15 \n{E9/172L} (the “12.5.15 Waiver & Indemnity” ). \n(2) Four executed Deeds of Waiver between D2 and ( i) D1 (dated 12.6.15) {E10/28}, ( ii) \nDubilet (dated 22.6.15) {E10/91}, ( iii) Novikov (dated 29.5.15) {E9/258} and ( iv) \nTriantal (dated “ …….. 2015 ”) {E7/182}.  \n(3) A draft Deed of Waiver between D2 and the Bank {E9/247.6}.  \n195 There are four key points to make about these documents. \n196 First, and most importantly, D2 does not suggest that the Purported 2015 Waivers provide \nhim with a defence to this claim, and they plainly do not:  \n(1) There is no executed waiver from the Bank (and even if there had been, given that it \nwas generated by the individuals who perpetrated the Misappropriation, it would have \nhad no effect).115 \n(2) The last of the Relevant Loans was entered into on 21.8.14 and the last Relevant \nDrawdowns were made on 1.9.14. Indeed, even if (which is wrong – see above) one \ntakes the start date as 1.7.14, that was still after 127 of the Relevant Loans had been \ngranted. D2’s leading counsel was right to say that the Purported 2015 Waivers do not \nprovide D2 with a “ get out of jail free card ” {Day7/20:21-22}. \n197 Secondly, the 12.5.15 Waiver & Indemnity covers: \n“any investigation, demand, claim, action or proceeding, brought or threatened against [D2] \narising in connection with his position as Chairman and/or shareholder (including in respect \nof [D2’s] own negligence, gross negligence, fraudulent or otherwise unlawful acts) …” \n{E9/172/5} (definition of ‘Claim’) \n198 D2 has chosen not to explain why he required a waiver for not merely grossly negligent \nconduct but for his “ fraudulent or otherwise unlawful acts ”. Indeed, the Court asked at \n{Day7/59:7-8} “[ d]o I know why [the Purported 2015 Waivers were ] thought to be necessary? ”, to \nwhich D2’s counsel fairly responded: “ You don’t ”. \n199 The obvious inference from D2’s failure to explain why he required a waiver in respect of \n“fraudulent or otherwise unlawful acts ” in May 2015 is that D2 knew that he had committed \n \n115  Though Ds have called no evidence to explain why not, the reason may appear from Recital (D), which explains \nthat – to be effective – the Supervisory Board and shareholders needed to approve the waiver after it had been \n“explained to them by a professional adviser ” {E9/247.6}. \nAA2/15/119\n113 fraudulent acts between July 2014 and 12.5.15 and that he feared detection at this time (see \nfurther Appendix L2 ). \n200 Thirdly, the Purported 2015 Waivers were kept confidential from all Bank outsiders. \n(1) The NBU was not informed, and neither were the auditors. In fact, and \nnotwithstanding that the 12.5.15 Waiver & Indemnity recites that “ Since 1 July 2014 \nParty 2 has been voting his shares in PrivatBank and acting as Chairman at the sole direction of \nParty 1 ” {E9/172/5}, the Bank’s audited accounts for the years ending 31.12.14 and \n31.12.15 both state that “ As at 31 December [2014 ] [2015 ] … neither [D1 or D2 ] \nindividually controlled the Bank. The major shareholders of the Bank did not have a contractual \nagreement on joint control of the Bank. ” {K1/4/10} (31.12.14 accounts), {K1/5/10} \n(31.12.15 accounts). So – if the Purported 2015 Waivers were genuine documents – \nthe Bank’s accounts were seriously misleading.  \n(2) The EY Related Parties Report (dated 16.7.15) likewise records that “ … none of the \nshareholders of the Bank is to be considered as its controller, because each of them  [has less than a \n50% shareholding ] and there is no agreement between them that enables such impact ” (emphasis \nadded) {E17/242/8} (¶4). That passage had been the source of considerable back-\nand-forth between the Bank and EY, as well as internal discussion: see {E10/141} \n(discussed at ¶145 above), {E10/210}. If there was an agreement between D1 and D2 \nas D2 contends, it seems nobody at the Bank was aware of it, or prepared to tell EY \nabout it"}

If there was an agreement between D1 and D2 \nas D2 contends, it seems nobody at the Bank was aware of it, or prepared to tell EY \nabout it. \n201 Fourthly, D2’s disclosure in relation to the Purported 2015 Waivers is thoroughly deficient: \n(1) There is no evidence to explain when any of the Purported 2015 Waivers were actually \nexecuted. This, again, was the subject of the Court’s 29.3.22 specific disclosure order: \n{A6/80/2} (¶3(b)). D2 has belatedly – on 4.6.23 {L/159.01} – produced a heavily \nredacted email showing that he forwarded to Anischenko on 12.5.15 an execution \nversion of the 12.5.15 Waiver & Indemnity. But when was it passed to D1 for \nsignature? And when was it actually signed? It is inconceivable that this process would \nnot have created a paper trail, given that D1’s signature was witnessed by Novikov \n(presumably in Ukraine) and D2’s by Alex van der Zwaan (in 2015, a solicitor \npractising in London; now, seemingly a non-legal advisor116 to D2 who has been \n \n116  Having been struck off after being imprisoned in the US as part of the Mueller Investigation: \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/03/alex-van-der-zwaan-jail-sentence-mueller-trump-\nrussia-investigation  \n{AA2/23/3}\nAA2/15/120\n114 present in Court throughout this trial but who has not been tendered as a witness): \n{E9/172L/4}. \n(2) Having received the paltry (and heavily redacted) documentation set out above on \n4.6.23, the Bank wrote to D2 three days later asking him to explain why he hadn’t \nproduced: ( i) any emails sent to D2 attaching execution versions of the Purported \n2015 Waivers; and/or ( ii) any emails showing transmission of such documents ‘across \nthe lines’ ( i.e. between D2 on the one hand and D1/Dubilet/Novikov/Triantal/the \nBank on the other): {L/162.2/2}. In D2’s reply of 9.6.23, he confirmed that “ no other \ndocuments have been withheld for privilege ”: {L/163.1/2} (¶3). In other words, D2 has no \nrecord (or no record he is prepared to disclose) showing when/how the Purported \n2015 Waivers were executed. \n(3) If D2 had continued acting at D1’s behest after 12.5.15, there should be a body of \ndocumentation to evidence D1’s instructions. In fact, just two scanned documents \nhave been disclosed ({E13/100} (28.3.16) and {E15/272} (27.9.16)). They are \nproduced as standalone documents, i.e. not attached to any emails,117 and the metadata \nfrom both dates their creation to December 2019 (and not March/September 2016).118 \nThey are letters from D1 addressed to D2’s Belgrave Square address, even though \nD2’s wife says that D2 left the UK following a family holiday in March 2016: \n{I3/60/7} (¶40).119 No copies of the envelopes or other evidence of postage has been \ndisclosed, and D2 has, of course, proffered no witness evidence as to how the letters \nwere received and retrieved from his London residence. And why were these letters \nbeing sent by post anyway (if they were indeed posted), rather than by email from \nNovikov or perhaps Cad Cool to Anischenko or D2? There is, again, no disclosure of \nany such email communication.  \n \n117  A further letter has been disclosed {E18/212}, a signed but undated letter of instruction drafted in near \nidentical terms to the 27.9.16 instruction and encloses an undated letter to Valeriya Gontareva also drafted in \nnear identical terms to the (dated) letter to Ms Gontareva attached to the 27.9.16 instruction.

The meta-data \ncreation date of the undated letter is 11.12.19 {E18/212L} {E18/212M}.  \n118  The Bank has located two different versions 27.9.16 letter: {E15/272L} and {E15/273L}. The documents are \nboth ‘wet ink’ signature versions of the letter and are identical save that D1’s signature appears in a slightly \ndifferent position. Both documents have a creation date of 11.12.19: {E15/272M) and {E15/273M}. As \nregards the 28.3.16 letter, {E13/100L} is the sole original ‘wet ink’ signature version of the document the Bank \nhas been able to locate. The document has a creation date of 11.12.19: {E13/100M}. The Bank has been \nunable to locate copies of any of these documents with earlier meta-data creation dates. The metadata date of \ncreation for the translations of the letters (see {E15/274} and {E18/211}) disclosed by D2 is 10.12.19 and \n16.12.19, respectively: {E15/274M} and {E18/211M}. \n119  D2’s own evidence is that he tried to stay out of England and away from Belgrave Square during the second \nhalf of 2016: {I3/20/11} ( ¶49). \nAA2/15/121\n115 202 In summary, far from giving D2 any defence (as he accepts) or being in some way \nexculpatory, the Purported 2015 Waivers are yet another tell-tale signal pointing to D2’s full \ncomplicity in the Misappropriation. The only plausible explanation for requiring these \ndocuments is that D2 recognised that he was involved in fraudulent activity at the Bank; and \nthe number of unanswered questions and disclosure failings in relation to this aspect of the \ncase demonstrate that the Court is not being told the half of what was really going on. \nD7 CONCLUSIONS  \n203 D1 has advanced no factual case of his own, and has not contested the facts relied upon by \nthe Bank: see, e.g., D1 Opening/ ¶88 {AA3/1/29}. We need say little more: it is obvious \nfrom the matters already described, before one even gets to inherent probabilities and \nadverse inferences, that D1 (together with D2) controlled the Bank, the various relevant \nmembers of its Management Board and the ECC. \n204 In contrast, D2’s case (via submission but not evidence) is that: he “ was not involved in the day-\nto-day management of the Bank ” {AA4/1/38} (¶100.2(i)); his involvement on the Supervisory \nBoard “ in practice amounted to giving a formal stamp of approval ” (¶100.2(ii)); his role was “ purely \nnominal ” and “ purely formal ” after July 2014  {AA4/1/43} (¶¶113-114), following which he \ntook “ no active interest in the Bank and wished to have no ongoing financial commitment to it ” \n{Day9/47:4-8}; the Supervisory Board was kept in the dark about the Management Board’s \nfailings {AA4/1/44} (¶116); and that it was the Management Board generally, and Dubilet \nin particular, who were responsible for any fraudulent lending ( e.g. {AA4/1} (¶¶7, 102, 312)). \nFor the reasons explained above, aside from being unsupported by any evidence from D2 \nor anyone else, D2’s case does not withstand scrutiny against the available documents. These \nshow that he was heavily involved in running the Bank, often attending to matters of real \ndetail. This close involvement did not end in June 2014. It continued after July 2014 all the \nway up to nationalisation. \n• • • \nE WITNESSES AND DISCLOSURE  \n205 In this section, we ( i) summarise the evidence given by the Bank’s ten witnesses; and ( ii) \nprovide a summary of D1-2’s lamentable approach to disclosure.

As the \nCourt will recall, Ds belatedly announced mid-trial that they did not intend to cross-examine \nfour of them (Ms Pogorelaya, Ms Domashenko, Mr Shekmar, all of whom had already made \nthe journey from Ukraine, and Mr Bondarenko). Their evidence therefore stands \nunchallenged. Those witnesses who did give oral evidence were credible and honest, and did \ntheir best to assist the Court in the face of irrelevant and often hostile cross-examination. \n(1) Kateryna Rozhkova  \n207 As the First Deputy Governor of the NBU ( i.e. the second most senior official at Ukraine’s \nCentral Bank), Ms Rozhkova holds a very senior position in a critical Ukrainian state \ninstitution. Her mandate covers maintaining financial stability, as well as regulation of \nUkraine’s banking sector. Notwithstanding the attendant responsibilities, especially whilst \nUkraine is involved in an existential war, Ms Rozhkova undertook the arduous land and air \njourney from Ukraine so that she could give evidence in London. She also – in order to \nassist the Court – chose to give her evidence in English rather than via an interpreter. Despite \nthe difficulties this (on occasion) presented for her, Ms Rozhkova’s evidence was clear, \ncandid and – when asked about relevant issues – of assistance to the Court. \n208 Quite apart from being a manifestly truthful witness, Ms Rozhkova demonstrated \nremarkable courage in providing her evidence. The Court has now seen substantial material \n– including evidence from Ms Rozhkova herself – regarding the character and reputation of \nD1 in  particular, and the steps he is prepared to take against those who have the temerity to \nstand up to him. Amongst other things, D1-2 organised a mob with funeral wreaths and \ncoffins to protest outside Ms Rozhkova’s house, whilst her 8-year-old daughter was inside, \nrequiring Ms Rozhkova to have a police escort to work. And then D1 gloated to D2 over \nWhatsApp about how their plan was “ working ” {K5-A2/6/43}. It will not have escaped the \nCourt’s notice that, over 1½ days of cross-examination, the account given by Ms Rozhkova \nof the threats and intimidation she faced went unchallenged. Despite all this, Ms Rozhkova \nresponded patiently to D1’s counsel’s aggressive and frequently irrelevant cross-\nexamination, which began with a wholly inappropriate attempt to disparage her evidence \nregarding the orchestrated protests and intimidation as “ silly” and “ having absolutely nothing to \ndo with the case ” {Day8/5:22} - {Day8/6:}. \n209 Written evidence. Ms Rozhkova’s written evidence covered the purpose and effect of \nUkraine’s banking reforms in 2014-16, the NBU’s regulation of the Bank in that period \nAA2/15/123\n117 (including in relation to the Asset Transfer and Transformation) and her experiences of \ndealing with D1-2. Ms Rozhkova was only taken to two paragraphs in total of her two \nstatements, which together run to 366 paragraphs (¶106 of Rozhkova1 and ¶66 of \nRozhkova2); the rest stands unchallenged. \n210 D1 cross-examination.  Ms Rozhkova was cross-examined by D1’s counsel for a full day. \nThe Court will have formed its own view as to the nature of the questioning.

What is \nundeniable is that Ms Rozhkova was not asked about many of the issues relevant to the \nBank’s claim on which she had given written evidence: there was nothing about the alleged \n“politically motivated conspiracy ” (abandoned the day the Bank filed its Opening Submissions: \nsee ¶509, but which remains on the pleadings) nor was she quizzed about D1’s allegation \nthat the NBU had “ supervised and controlled ” the Transformation. \n211 Instead, D1’s counsel spent most of his time asking Ms Rozhkova about the Glavcom article \nand a succession of further press articles, most of which pre-dated her time at the NBU. \nThis apparently formed part of an attempt to establish that these articles constituted such \nclear evidence of a blatant fraud for the benefit of D1120 that Ms Rozhkova had sufficient \nknowledge to ensure that legal proceedings were brought. But that was a road to nowhere \nin circumstances in which Ds have not pleaded, and no party’s Ukrainian law expert has \nsuggested, that the knowledge of the Bank’s regulator is relevant to when time starts to run \nagainst the Bank for limitation purposes. \n212 D2 cross-examination. Ms Rozhkova was cross-examined by D2’s counsel for a little under \ntwo hours. She sought to put to Ms Rozhkova the case that D2 had, from 2014, “ ceased to \nhave any active management role ” with the Bank {Day9/21:2-6}. To the extent that Ms Rozhkova \ncould say anything at all about that, it was set out in her written evidence that “ Mr Kolomoisky \nmade clear on a number of occasions in the course of our discussions that he would need to check with Mr \nBogolyubov before he could agree to various points ” {B1/5/46} (¶181). That was not challenged \n(and, indeed, was expressly accepted at the very outset by D2’s counsel121). In those \ncircumstances, D2’s counsel’s attempts to distance D2 from the management of the Bank \nduring the remainder of Ms Rozhkova’s cross-examination went nowhere. \n \n120  See, for example, {Day8/58:4-8} and {Day8/96:1-17}. \n121  {Day9/1:20-23}: “A. [Ms Rozhkova] … during our discussion with Mr Kolomoisky, he referenced that some steps should \nbe negotiated with Mr Bogolyubov ; Q. [CMKC] That’s what he said… ”. \nAA2/15/124\n118 (2) Dmitry Luchaninov \n213 Mr Luchaninov was the head of the Bank’s compliance department at the times relevant to \nthe Bank’s claims. He attended Court in person to give his evidence, via an interpreter. \n214 Written evidence. Mr Luchaninov’s written evidence focussed on the instructions he was \ngiven by Dubilet, Yatsenko, Novikov and Gurieva to hide related party affiliations, and the \nsteps he took to implement them, in particular in sending the Luchaninov Email. Mr \nLuchaninov was taken to only four of the 92 paragraphs of his statement (¶¶10, 13, 14, 17); \nthe rest stands unchallenged. \n215 D2 cross-examination. Mr Luchaninov was only cross-examined by D2. A half-hearted \nattempt was made to have him say that he had been told what to write in his statement, and \nto accept that BOK continued to operate in the same way after nationalisation as it did \nbeforehand (albeit under a different name); but Mr Luchaninov gave candid and credible \nanswers on both points: {Day9/54:10} - {Day9/56:2} and {Day9/72:19} - {Day9/74:10}. \n216 A great deal of Mr Luchaninov’s questioning was spent trying to cajole him into accepting \nthat the related party issues he had been asked to address were concerned with “ not just \nrelatedness ” {Day9/87:22} but “[ w]hat’s being avoided is anything that shows the links so as to avoid \nthe problem of concentration of related parties ” {Day9/90:25} - {Day9/91:2}. But that was a false \ndichotomy: if BOK had to manage concentrations of related parties, that was only because \nthere were so many borrowers owned and controlled by D1-2 that they had to be split into \ndifferent groups with different purported UBOs; artificially adjusting loan concentrations in \nthis way necessarily i"}

But that was a false \ndichotomy: if BOK had to manage concentrations of related parties, that was only because \nthere were so many borrowers owned and controlled by D1-2 that they had to be split into \ndifferent groups with different purported UBOs; artificially adjusting loan concentrations in \nthis way necessarily involved hiding D1-2’s ownership and control over these companies.  \n(3) Maryna Lozytska \n217 Ms Lozytska worked in BOK prior to nationalisation, and has continued to work at the Bank \nsince. She was another who travelled London to give evidence in person, via an interpreter. \n218 Written evidence. Ms Lozytska explained how BOK operated separately from the rest of the \nBank, and that its clients were treated separately and, she assumed, were ultimately owned \nby D1-2 {B1/6/5} (¶14). She also explained the role of PBC, and in particular Melnyk, in \nmanaging BOK’s customers (¶37 ff). Ms Lozytska was only taken to five of the 49 paragraphs \nof her statement (¶¶11, 15, 36, 42 and 49); the rest stands unchallenged. \n219 D2 cross-examination. Ms Lozytska, like Mr Luchaninov, was only cross-examined by D2. \nFollowing another unsuccessful attempt to establish that BOK was still operating, under a \nAA2/15/125\n119 new name, post-nationalisation {Day10/3:5} ff, D2’s cross-examination focussed on the \nissue of related parties/credit concentrations, by reference to the Rokoman Spreadsheet. \n220 In particular, Ms Lozytska was asked about an email from Rokoman to Gurieva, to which \nshe was copied, and about various versions of the Rokoman Spreadsheet. The questions \nwere premised upon the email being concerned with reducing credit concentrations rather \nthan concealing beneficial ownership. But as explained above (and in greater detail in \nSection G ]), that was a false dichotomy. Ms Lozytska was also clear that the beneficiaries \nrecorded in the Rokoman Spreadsheet were not the real beneficiaries, referring to the \n(oxymoronic) concept of “ nominal beneficiaries ” {Day10/16:9-19}.  \n(4) Sergiy Oleksiyenko \n221 Mr Oleksiyenko is, and has since nationalisation been, a member of the Bank’s Supervisory \nBoard. He made the trip from Ukraine to London to give his evidence in person, doing so \nin English to assist the Court. \n222 Written evidence. Mr Oleksiyenko gave written evidence as to the priorities of the Bank’s \nnew management when they were installed post-nationalisation, including the steps needed \nto keep the Bank functioning in the first half of 2017. He confirmed that their focus turned \nto investigating potential claims against D1-2 in the second half of the year, once the Bank \nhad been stabilised. Mr Oleksiyenko was only taken to nine paragraphs of his 66-paragraph \nstatement (¶¶10, 11, 40, 52, 55, 63, 64, 65 and 66); the rest stands unchallenged. \n223 D1 cross-examination. Mr Oleksiyenko was only cross-examined by D1. That cross-\nexamination – which lasted for 1½ days – focussed solely on limitation issues. We make \nthree points about that.  \n224 First, Mr Oleksiyenko kept his composure even though he can fairly be said to have been \nharangued during an unnecessarily aggressive and drawn-out cross-examination: \n(1) He was accused of (i) not answering questions when he had plainly done so ( e.g. as the \nCourt observed at {Day10/37:25} ff) (ii) making speeches when he had not ( e.g. at \n{Day10/66:7-15}, after he had given an answer running to all of 50 words); ( iii) \nseeking to argue the Bank’s case ( e.g. {Day10/48:17-20} and {Day10/49:20} ff). But \nMr Oleksiyenko was candid in his responses and, indeed, was prepared to make \nappropriate concessions (as we set out below).  \n(2) He was also criticised by D1’s counsel regarding his evidence on interest payments \nunder the New Loans {Day11/47:6-12}. Having established in questioning on the \n{AA2"}
{"start": 350000, "text": "eeches when he had not ( e.g. at \n{Day10/66:7-15}, after he had given an answer running to all of 50 words); ( iii) \nseeking to argue the Bank’s case ( e.g. {Day10/48:17-20} and {Day10/49:20} ff). But \nMr Oleksiyenko was candid in his responses and, indeed, was prepared to make \nappropriate concessions (as we set out below).  \n(2) He was also criticised by D1’s counsel regarding his evidence on interest payments \nunder the New Loans {Day11/47:6-12}. Having established in questioning on the \n{AA2/15/178}\nAA2/15/126\n120 basis of a presentation from March 2017 {E17/143/3} that around half of the interest \ndue remained outstanding at that stage, D1’s counsel suggested that Mr Oleksiyenko \nhad addressed the point in his written evidence in “ a rather misleading way ”. But there \nwas nothing misleading at all in Mr Oleksiyenko’s written evidence: he said that “ the \nportion of overdue interest… was higher than the principal ” {B1/10/7} (¶24(b)); that “ overdue \ninterest and principal… was increasing ” {B1/10/10} (¶37); and that there had been UAH \n4.5bn in overdue interest by March 2017 {B1/10/12} (¶47). It is notable that D1’s \ncounsel did not pursue this (unjustified) criticism {Day11/47:11}. \n(3) It was suggested that ¶63 of his witness statement required correction because “ it seeks \nto give the impression that these GPO proceedings were not something of which you were aware, but I \nthink we’re now establishing you were aware of them, both from the article and from the fact that Mr \nShlapak explained to you that he had been providing information to the prosecutor ” \n{Day11/85:19} ff. But Mr Oleksiyenko had been candid at ¶63 of his statement that \n“I cannot say absolutely that they were never mentioned to us ”, and, once he had been shown \nrelevant contemporaneous documents, he accepted that he probably would have been \naware of them. It is, in that regard, notable that the Shlapak report on which D1’s \ncounsel placed heavy reliance dealt with a great many issues and proceedings across \n126 pages, of which these were just one (see, e.g., {E17/100/122-126}). \n225 Secondly, Mr Oleksiyenko was asked a number of questions that were based on false \npremises. For example, Mr Oleksiyenko was asked about two NBU reports ({E14/257} and \n{E15/28/9}), in respect of which it was said that: “… anyone reading these reports… would \nunderstand that the NBU was of the view that the borrowers and the suppliers, the ones who are the subject \nof these proceedings, were simply means, as the NBU saw it, of [D1 and D2 ] taking money from the Bank ” \n{Day10/127:8-14}.122 But, at most, the reports suggest that the NBU had partly investigated \nthe fraud: between them, they referred to only 16 of the 50 Borrowers, and to only four of \nthe six Defendant Suppliers. It is, in this regard, telling that D1’s counsel considered it \npreferable to “ skip over the detail ” of the second NBU report {Day10/126:19}.  \n226 Thirdly, and as noted above, Mr Oleksiyenko’s cross-examination was almost entirely \ndevoted to limitation:  \n(1) D1’s counsel spent most of the time explaining how the fraud perpetrated by his client \nand D2 was so blatant that it must have been obvious to anyone at the Bank ( e.g. “Q: \n \n122  See also {Day10/128:24} - {Day10/129:2} (NBU had “ investigated ” and were satisfied by the end of 2016 that \nthe journalists were correct) and {Day10/129:18-23} (NBU reached conclusions consistent with journalists). \nAA2/15/127\n121 … in December 2016 you are fully aware of the fact that at least $1.82 billion has been \nmisappropriated, as you see it, or that misappropriation has been procured by Mr Kolomoisky and \nMr Bogolyubov by use of the borrower and supplier companies; correct? ” {Day10/114:19} ff. \n(2) This line of questioning was seemingly aimed at getting Mr Oleksiyenko to accept that \nhe was aware of the 2014 Ukrainian Judgments, in relation to which he had said at ¶64 \nthat he had “ …no recollection of these decisions ever having been provided to "}
{"start": 353500, "text": "are of the fact that at least $1.82 billion has been \nmisappropriated, as you see it, or that misappropriation has been procured by Mr Kolomoisky and \nMr Bogolyubov by use of the borrower and supplier companies; correct? ” {Day10/114:19} ff. \n(2) This line of questioning was seemingly aimed at getting Mr Oleksiyenko to accept that \nhe was aware of the 2014 Ukrainian Judgments, in relation to which he had said at ¶64 \nthat he had “ …no recollection of these decisions ever having been provided to me, or those proceedings \nhaving been brought to my attention except as part of Hogan Lovells’ work in late 2017… ” \n{B1/10/17}.  \n(3) And this led to a totally overblown attack on the language used at ¶64 of Oleksiyenko’s \nevidence: e.g. {Day10/85:14} - {Day10/91:7} (“ An honest person would say  …”, “ My \nquestion was simply about honesty  …”). But, far from being dishonest, when D1’s counsel \nintroduced the NashiGroshi articles, and asked “ Are you familiar with that publication? ”, \nMr Oleksiyenko volunteered that “ I don’t remember details but it is quite possible that I have \nseen it [sc. the NashiGroshi articles ] at the time of publication ”, an answer D1’s counsel \ndescribed as “ very helpful ”; and, in response to a follow up question, Mr Oleksiyenko \nagreed that it was likely he saw the articles when they were published: {Day10/59:19} \n- {Day10/60:5}. Indeed, Mr Oleksiyenko agreed that he had knowledge of the 2014 \nUkrainian proceedings to the extent they were referred to in the NashiGroshi articles \n{Day10/91:16-17}. These are plainly not the answers of a dishonest witness. \n(5) Galyna Pakhachuk \n227 Ms Pakhachuk is a banker with 40 years’ experience in the private and public sectors. She \njoined the Bank’s post-nationalisation Management Board on 23.12.16 and was Acting \nChairman of the Management Board from 25.7.17 until January 2018. She remained on the \nManagement Board until 31.8.21, when her term expired. She then acted temporarily as an \nadvisor to the Chairman of the Management Board before leaving the Bank and becoming \ndirector of the financial controlling department of the NBU. Ms Pakhachuk was another \nwitness to travel to London to give evidence to the Court in person, via an interpreter. \n228 Written evidence. Ms Pakhachuk’s written evidence explained the numerous challenges \nfacing the Bank immediately following nationalisation – in particular, its liquidity and cash \nflow problems and the risk that retail customers would be unable to access their deposits. \nAs she explained, it is “ difficult to overstate the complexity and pressure faced by the new management \nteam”: Pakhachuk/¶13 {B1/1/5} (see also {Day12/35:11-20}). She also gave evidence \nAA2/15/128\n122 about the new Management Board’s awareness of the Misappropriation and the Bank’s \ndecision to commence these proceedings. \n229 Ms Pakhachuk was only taken to 11 of the 71 paragraphs of her statement (¶¶19, 24, 26, 30, \n40-42, 45, 46, 49 and 61). She gave evidence on a number of matters that went unchallenged, \nin particular ( i) the competing pressures on the Bank’s post-nationalisation Management \nBoard (¶¶14-15); ( ii) the loyalty of Bank employees to D1 (¶¶16, 17, 18 and 20); ( iii) the \n“deliberate attempt to ‘clean out’ the Bank’s documents before the nationalisation ” (¶¶21-22); and ( iv) \nthe cost of the Bank’s own lending (¶¶62-71), relevant to its interest claim. \n230 D1 cross-examination. D1’s counsel’s cross-examination of Ms Pakhachuk, which lasted for \nthe whole of Day 12, related exclusively to limitation. It focussed on Ms Pakhachuk’s \nfamiliarity with certain reports and articles in early 2017, as well as her understanding of \ninvestigations within the Bank and negotiations with D1-2 in the first half of 2017. But the \nquestions did not advance the factual case beyond her written evidence to any great extent: \n(1) Ms Pakhachuk’s evidence was that, while she had some prior familiarity with the Bank \ndue to her role at the Ministry of Financ"}

But the \nquestions did not advance the factual case beyond her written evidence to any great extent: \n(1) Ms Pakhachuk’s evidence was that, while she had some prior familiarity with the Bank \ndue to her role at the Ministry of Finance, she did not attend any briefings by the NBU \nupon her appointment to the Management Board {Day12/11:22} - {Day12/16:21}. \nShe explained, as she had in her written evidence {B1/1/7} (¶¶23-24), that she was \nprovided with the NBU’s report of 25.7.16, which she studied in January 2017 \n{Day12/16:22} - {Day12/18:9}. She also accepted that she was aware of the NBU’s \nfindings relating to the Bank’s related party lending to D1-2’s companies \n{Day12/18:17} - {Day12/19:4}, {Day12/19:22-25}; {Day12/21:17-25} and the \ndubious creditworthiness of the New Borrowers {Day12/77:2-8}; {Day12/80:7-21}. \n(2) While Ms Pakhachuk’s focus was on pressing liquidity issues {Day12/35:3-20}, she \naccepted that she had read articles referring to elements of the Misappropriation as \nearly as January 2017, and that she had been aware of the reports of the GPO’s \ncriminal proceedings and the Ukrainian Judgments (as she had already explained in \nher written evidence {B1/1/15} (¶61)123): {Day12/22:10-15}. Even if (unsurprisingly) \nshe could not remember the exact articles she had read some 6½ years ago, she made \nno secret of the fact that she was aware of the allegations they made: {Day12/26:12-\n \n123  Ms Pakhachuk was also asked why she had not referred to the NashiGroshi articles in her witness statement \n{Day12/36:12-25}. Ms Pakhachuk’s written and oral evidence addresses the state of the Management Board’s \nknowledge and she cannot realistically be expected to have referred to every article about the Bank at the time \n(particularly as her evidence is that there were “ so many materials, articles, minutes of the meetings, results and findings ” \n{Day12/34:11-15}). \nAA2/15/129\n123 13} {Day12/37:25}; {Day12/38:19-23}. She also accepted, without hesitation, that \nshe could not recall whether or not she had read the Glavcom article at the time and \nwas happy to correct her written evidence to make that clear {Day12/38:8-12}; \n{Day12/39:19-25}. \n(3) Ms Pakhachuk’s focus on the Bank’s financial stability also meant that she was not \nfamiliar with the details of the work undertaken by the committee headed by \nLevadsky.124 She was, however, able to explain that its remit was wide (“ would deal with \n[a] big spectrum of affairs ” {Day12/51:3-7}) and that she did not recall seeing the resulting \nreport {Day12/55:9-22}. \n(4) Ms Pakhachuk explained that she appreciated, from the start of 2017, that there was \na risk that D1-2’s commitment to a negotiated settlement would not be fulfilled, but \nthat it was not until later in the year that it became clear that the negotiations were \nlikely to fail {Day12/44:14} - {Day12/46:9}. This was, in part, because the New \nLoans were being serviced in early 2017: “[ i]n January and February, 1.6 billion hyrvnias \nwere paid to the Bank, which is big money ” {Day12/89:14-16}; but by July, service of the \nloan portfolio was “ much worse than in the beginning ” {Day12/90:5-7}. This was also \nconsistent with her written evidence: by July, “ the levels of overdue interest and principal \npayments had reached concerning levels ” {B1/1/13} (¶49(a)). \n231 D2 cross-examination. In D2’s brief questioning of Ms Pakhachuk (Day 13): \n(1) D2’s counsel complained that Ms Pakhachuk had referred to D1-2 together when \ndiscussing the ongoing loyalty of Bank employees.

In D2’s brief questioning of Ms Pakhachuk (Day 13): \n(1) D2’s counsel complained that Ms Pakhachuk had referred to D1-2 together when \ndiscussing the ongoing loyalty of Bank employees. Ms Pakhachuk accepted that she \nhad no hard “ evidence ” of employees’ loyalty, but confirmed that this was her \nimpression {Day13/3:18}. She was not asked to explain the basis of her impression \nor further challenged about it. \n(2) Various questions were put to Ms Pakhachuk about employees continuing to work \nfor the Bank post-nationalisation {Day13/5:11} ff and {Day13/13:15} ff, presumably \nto prepare the ground for an argument that a quicker investigation should have been \npossible or that the Bank should have got rid of them. But, as Ms Pakhachuk \nexplained, there were competing priorities and “ thousands of investigations, including those \nrelated to the NBU refinancing and loans that used this refinancing ” {Day13/6:19-25}. Ms \n \n124  Ms Pakhachuk clarified, after misspeaking, that she was aware of the events described in the order establishing \nthe committee but that she did not recall seeing the order at the time: {Day12/53:7-12}. \nAA2/15/130\n124 Pakhachuk also explained that the Bank “ could not replace about 20,000 of staff ” and that \nthe Management Board therefore “ took it in stages ” {Day13/14:19} ff. \n(3) In an apparent attempt to support D2’s wider loan recycling analysis, it was put to Ms \nPakhachuk that she had previously said that the Bank’s US dollar lending stayed \n“relatively constant at the equivalent of about US 4 billion between 2010 and 2016 ” \n{Day13/17:16} ff. But, having failed to add the document relied on the bundle, D2’s \ncounsel was unable to take Ms Pakhachuk to it and Ms Pakhachuk was only able to \npoint out that this general assertion could conceal month-to-month fluctuations. \n(6) Iryna Hryn \n232 Ms Hryn was an in-house lawyer at the Bank from 2011 to 2021. She gave her evidence in \nUkrainian via video-link from Kyiv.  \n233 Ms Hryn’s written evidence explained that her signature had been forged on various claim \ndocuments purportedly filed on behalf of the Bank in late 2017. She confirmed, at ¶23, that \nthe signatures appearing on the claims were not hers {B1/16/6-7}. Ms Hryn was asked \nwhether she maintained her evidence and why, and her answers were accepted by D1’s \ncounsel {Day11/21:7-21}. Indeed, D1’s counsel himself went on to speculate that someone \nelse in the Bank’s legal department forged Ms Hryn’s signature {Day11/22:12-15}. \n234 Beyond that, most of Ms Hryn’s cross-examination sought to establish the identities of \nlawyers in the Bank’s legal department (see, e.g., {Day11/6:15}, {Day11/8:6} and \n{Day11/10:25} - {Day11/13:4}), although the purpose of eliciting such information was \nunclear.  \n(7) Olena Pogorelaya (unchallenged) \n235 Ms Pogorelaya is a Bank employee who, prior to nationalisation, worked in the Corporate \nVIP Business loan department. Her unchallenged evidence  {B1/8/2} is that, alongside her \nday-to-day-work, she ( i) assisted the Bank’s Cyprus branch by finalising and executing loan \ndocumentation (typically by providing missing information and then leaving the documents, \nwhich were often to be backdated, with Yatsenko’s secretary to arrange for execution by the \nBank and/or the purported customer) (¶¶11-23); ( ii) was asked to prepare letters on behalf \nof clients ( e.g. purporting to explain why they had failed to repay loans) (¶¶24-27); ( iii) was \npaid to act as a director of one Bank client (the unnamed UBOs of which were said to be \nbased in Cyprus); and ( iv) often acted as a shareholder of other bank clients (but did not \nattend or vote at any of the shareholders’ meetings that were purportedly held by those \nAA2/15/131\n125 clients) (¶¶37-51).

Ms Pogorelaya also confirmed that she would have lost her job if she had \nrefused to perform a task she had been asked to do (¶22). \n(8) Ruslana Domashenko (unchallenged) \n236 Ms Domashenko was the Bank’s curator from February 2015 onwards. In her unchallenged \nevidence {B1/14/2}, Ms Domashenko explained ( i) her main function as curator ( viz. the \ndaily reporting of information to the NBU’s oversight department) (¶¶19-20); ( ii) that her \nrole was not to instruct or direct the Bank on how to conduct its operations, and nor did \nshe seek to do so (¶¶26-27; 55); ( iii) her real practical difficulties in interrogating the Bank’s \ntransactions ( e.g. because she did not have access to certain basic information from within \nthe Cypriot branch) (¶¶28-39); and ( iv) that she rejected D1’s allegation that she “ supervised \nand controlled ” the Transformation (¶¶54-57). \n(9) Mykhailo Shekmar (unchallenged) \n237 Mr Shekmar, of the NBU, was involved with a scheduled inspection of the Bank between \n8.2.16 and 1.7.16 and led an unscheduled inspection of the Bank between 17.10.16 and \n31.12.16. He has more than 17 years’ experience of inspecting Ukrainian banks, and has \nbeen involved in more than 100 such inspections in all. His unchallenged evidence \n{B1/12/2} ( i) explains the manifold problems identified by the scheduled 2016 inspection, \nincluding in relation to collateral purportedly provided by supply agreements (¶¶28-38); ( ii) \nrejects D1’s allegation that the Transformation was “s upervised and controlled ” by him or his \nteam (¶¶45-61); and ( iii) explains that the results of the unscheduled inspection, which was \nhampered by the Bank’s failure to provide information ( e.g. about D1’s withdrawal of UAH \n6bn from the Bank during 2016 (¶69)), demonstrated the Bank’s insolvency (¶¶62-67). \n(10) Valerii Bondarenko (unchallenged) \n238 Mr Bondarenko is a lawyer in the Bank’s legal department. His unchallenged evidence \n{B1/11} was that his signature was forged on at least six of the New Borrower claims.  \nE2 D1-2’ S DEFICIENT DISCLOSURE  \n(1) D1’s disclosure failings \n239 We addressed D1’s disclosure failings at {Day13/98:11} ff. Here, we address ( i) D1’s \ndisclosure obligations; ( ii) his disclosure from his personal document sources; ( iii) his \ndisclosure from third party custodians; and ( iv) his disclosure from his key lieutenants.  \n240 The headline point is this: D1 has not disclosed a single communication between him to \nanyone in the period before May 2015. That is extraordinary. In the circumstances, the Court \nAA2/15/132\n126 should draw inferences as to who D1 was communicating with, and what he was \ncommunicating about, during the period of the Misappropriation: see Section B1(2)  (¶47) \nabove.  \n(a) D1’s disclosure obligations \n241 D1 and D2 were ordered to give Model D disclosure (with narrative documents) in relation \nto the majority of the issues, but Model E (‘train of inquiry’) disclosure in relation to their \nownership and control of the Relevant Entities ( i.e. the Borrowers, the Intermediary \nBorrowers, D3-8, the Alleged Principals and the New Borrowers) {A4/1} (rows 5, 14, 17.6 \nand 24); {A5/12.1/10} (¶11). D1’s Section 2 DRD {A4/7/1} set out the devices he \nintended to search and the third parties he intended to approach. We make three points here: \n(1) D1 deliberately avoided accepting that he controlled the documents of any of the \ncompanies he intended to approach on a “ voluntary ” basis (including the Borrowers, \nIntermediary Borrowers, Pledgors, Asset Transferors, New Borrowers, and Lafferty \nSpreadsheets Companies) {A4"}
{"start": 367500, "text": "he New Borrowers) {A4/1} (rows 5, 14, 17.6 \nand 24); {A5/12.1/10} (¶11). D1’s Section 2 DRD {A4/7/1} set out the devices he \nintended to search and the third parties he intended to approach. We make three points here: \n(1) D1 deliberately avoided accepting that he controlled the documents of any of the \ncompanies he intended to approach on a “ voluntary ” basis (including the Borrowers, \nIntermediary Borrowers, Pledgors, Asset Transferors, New Borrowers, and Lafferty \nSpreadsheets Companies) {A4/7/2-5} or those held by any of the individuals he \nidentified as custodians of potentially relevant documents (see below). That set the \nstage for D1 to evade his disclosure obligations generally by contending, wholly \nimplausibly (and wrongly, the Court has found in relation to the Lafferty Spreadsheets \nCompanies), that his ability to collect documents was at the mercy of third-party \ncompanies and individuals. We address this further in ¶247 ff below.  \n(2) He listed “ at least 12 providers of corporate, legal consulting and fiduciary services ” {A4/7/3} \nbut failed to include PBC. This omission was a deliberate attempt by D1 to avoid \nflagging PBC’s importance and thereby evade giving disclosure of its documents.  \n(3) He identified certain former Bank employees who he intended to approach for \ndocuments. They included those who gave evidence for D1 (Pugach, Kazantsev, \nKoryak, Yatsenko), key lieutenants (Novikov, Dubilet, Gurieva, Chmona), and \nindividuals involved in the inflated valuations of the Share Pledges and Transferred \nAssets (Plyska, Chernyshov): {A4/7/21}. D1 did not identify any members of the \n“team” who produced the Lafferty Spreadsheets other than Gurieva. In the event, D1 \nobtained only a pitiful set of documents from those he did include on the list.  \n(b) D1’s personal documents and devices \n242 D1’s personal documents. D1 admits that he “ consciously and actively restrict [s] the volume of \ndocuments he has created and handled ”; has not “ used his desktop computers to store or create any electronic \n{AA2/15/30}\nAA2/15/133\n127 documents ”; does not use (“ and has never used ”) a personal email account because he “ does not \nconsider email to be a safe and reliable method of communication ”; and his “ practice ” has been to dispose \nof hard copy documents “ immediately or once any action points have been completed ”.125 As to that: \n(1) D1 has disclosed no personal emails; no documents from any personal computer or \niPad; only 19 emails (only four of which pre-date nationalisation), together with 72 \nattachments, from accounts of secretaries at Cad Cool and Privat Intertrading over a \nfive-year period.  \n(2) But D1 has retained hard copy documents where he considers them to be useful to \nhim such as documents given to him in hard copy which he believed supported his \n(now abandoned) ‘political campaign’ defence: see Kolomoisky1/¶41 {H2/1/9}).  \n243 D1’s failure to disclose other relevant hard copy documents includes:  \n(1) No disclosure of directories for the ‘Black’.  \n(2) No disclosure of diaries or similar documents. It is inherently incredible that D1 (or \nmore likely his secretaries) does not retain records which keep track of where he was \nsupposed to be and when, and who he was supposed to be meeting. \n244 D1 personal devices – mobile phones. The relevant devices here are as follows:  \n(1) iPhones. D1’s Section 2 DRD identified “ three iPhone smartphones used from 2015 to date ” \n{A4/7/1}. His 1st Disclosure Certificate identified four iPhones, two of which had \nbeen imaged in July 2019, one in September 2019 (and again in February/March 2021), \nand the last in February/March 2021 {A4/22/10}.  \n(2) Nokia and other devices. D1’s Section 2 DRD explained that he had not retained two \nNokia phones he used “ before he started using iPhone [s]” in 2015 {A4/7/1}. His 1st \nDisclosure Certificate explained that these two Nokia devices had been imaged in or \nabout June 2014 for the Pinchuk Proceedings but that he h"}

D1’s Section 2 DRD explained that he had not retained two \nNokia phones he used “ before he started using iPhone [s]” in 2015 {A4/7/1}. His 1st \nDisclosure Certificate explained that these two Nokia devices had been imaged in or \nabout June 2014 for the Pinchuk Proceedings but that he had given an instruction to \nAlix Partners (his disclosure provider in those proceedings) to delete the images on or \nabout 9.3.16 {A4/22/11} (¶¶2.2.7-2.2.14). That instruction was given c. 2 weeks \nbefore the Tatneft Proceedings were issued on 21.3.16. D1 is apparently unable to \nexplain what happened to the original Nokia mobile phones.  \n \n125  Schedule to D1’s Disclosure Certificate {A4/22/10} (¶¶2.1.4, 2.2.16, 2.3.1, 2.4.1). \nAA2/15/134\n128 (3) In short, the earliest disclosed document available from any of D1’s devices is dated \n12.5.15 (from one of his iPhone 6s). He has disclosed no documents at all from his \nphones for the period of the Misappropriation.  \n245 D1’s personal devices – WhatsApp messages and calls. The vast majority of D1’s disclosure \nfrom his mobile devices has been in the form of WhatsApp chats, comprising messages and \nfiles (attachments) sent/received by the participants in each chat. D1 has disclosed no \nSMS/text messages at all, without explanation. As to what has been produced: ( i) D1’s \noriginal disclosure of WhatsApp messages was woefully inadequate (see Bank \nOpening/¶179 {AA2/1/78}); ( ii) after his solicitors were ordered to re-review his \nWhatsApp messages, a further c. 2,800 messages were unredacted or disclosed for the first \ntime, many of which are highly relevant; and ( iii) even now, there are serious gaps in D1’s \ndisclosure of WhatsApp messages with key individuals which D1 has not been able to \nexplain. Briefly on those points:  \n(1) Originally redacted/withheld messages: The WhatsApp messages which were \noriginally redacted (or withheld entirely) include ( i) D1 – Markova messages by which \nD1 received the account balances of Sanderlyn and Versala, the companies which paid \nD3-8’s legal fees {K5-A1/40/1} ff; (ii) D1 – Melnikova messages by which D1 was \nasked to approve payment of Primecap’s taxes and social insurance {K5-A1/42/4} \n(message on 20.10.16 at 10:39:18); ( iii) D1 – Granovsky messages by which \nGranovsky told D1 about the 2016 arrest orders made against D4 and D6-8 {K5-\nA1/24/7}; ( iv) five D1 – D2 chats (one of which alone runs to 571 messages and 87 \npages) which were not produced until after the WhatsApp Judgment, the sixth such \nchat having been disclosed in such a heavily-redacted form that the only unobscured \ncontent was the single digit ‘1’ (being the file name to an attached document). Even \nbefore the WhatsApp Judgment {A5/20}, it should have been obvious that messages \nof this sort were relevant and disclosable. Had the trial not been adjourned, much of \nthis material would have remained redacted or withheld until well into the evidence. \n(2) Gaps in D1’s WhatsApp exchanges. We draw attention to the following:  \n(a) D1 – D2 WhatsApp messages. There are important periods for which D1 has \nnot disclosed his messages with D2 where we know D1 and D2 were messaging \neach other because D2 has disclosed his messages with D1 for the same period. \nIn particular: ( i) in the period 4.7.17 – 22.12.17 D2 has disclosed 188 messages \nwith D1 while D1 has disclosed none; and ( ii) in the period 11.9.19 – 15.3.21 \nAA2/15/135\n129 D2 has disclosed 1,172 messages with D1 while D1 has disclosed just nine.126 \nD1 cannot explain these gaps in his WhatsApp disclosure (when the Bank \npointed out the gaps and asked for an explanation {L/91/20}, D1’s solicitors \nsaid only that that he is “ not a technical expert ” {L/108/5} (¶4.3)). \n(b) D1 messages with key personnel.

{"start": 374500, "text": " – 22.12.17 D2 has disclosed 188 messages \nwith D1 while D1 has disclosed none; and ( ii) in the period 11.9.19 – 15.3.21 \nAA2/15/135\n129 D2 has disclosed 1,172 messages with D1 while D1 has disclosed just nine.126 \nD1 cannot explain these gaps in his WhatsApp disclosure (when the Bank \npointed out the gaps and asked for an explanation {L/91/20}, D1’s solicitors \nsaid only that that he is “ not a technical expert ” {L/108/5} (¶4.3)). \n(b) D1 messages with key personnel. As the Bank’s hand-up at {AA6/9/1} shows, \nthere are unexplained gaps in D1’s disclosure of his messages with his key \nlieutenants including ( i) exiguous pre-nationalisation disclosure of WhatsApp \nwith D2, Novikov, Dubilet and Gurieva, ( ii) no disclosure of messages with \nNovikov, Dubilet, Gurieva, Chmona or Melnikova whatsoever in the period of \nthe Transformation (October – December 2016) and ( iii) no disclosure of \nmessages with Novikov in the c. 11-week period immediately prior to the issue \nof this claim (when we know that they were in WhatsApp communication \nbecause one message has been disclosed dated 30.11.17 which records that it \nwas ‘DELETED’ {K5-A1/49/2}).127  \n(3) No call logs. D1 has not disclosed any call logs (whether from WhatsApp or at all). \nThe WhatsApp message chains show calls D1 missed (by showing a ‘missed call’): but \nthat is not a record of the calls D1 made, or the calls which D1 picked up. \n246 The Court should consider the volume of messages in the period for which disclosure has \n(belatedly) been given and infer that there was a similar volume and nature of \ncommunication between D1 and Novikov, Dubilet, Gurieva and others in the period of the \nMisappropriation for which no disclosure has been given, and which would support the \nBank’s case: see Section B1(2) above. \n(c) D1’s disclosure from third parties \n247 D1’s disclosure from third parties, to the extent it has occurred at all, has been deliberately \nprotracted and self-serving. We draw attention to the following:  \n(1) Lafferty Spreadsheets Companies. The manner in which D1 obtained these \ncompanies’ bank statements is addressed in detail in Section F4 . Having provided D1 \nwith their confidential bank statements at short notice in around June 2018, many of \n \n126  This latter gap suggests that D1 deliberately deleted his messages with D2 in the period between September \n2019 (when his devices were imaged in the Tatneft Proceedings) and March 2021 (when his devices were \nimaged for the purposes of these proceedings).  \n127  D1’s solicitor explained that “[ i]n order to undertake the further review, the images collected from the First Defendant’s \nphones were reprocessed by the First Defendant’s e-disclosure provider (‘Ankura’). This process identified previously deleted Viber \nchats which were recovered during the re-processing and are now therefore visible ” {L/75.0001}, though this particular \nexample appears from the cover page to be a WhatsApp chat. \n{AA2/15/30}\n{AA2/15/174}\nAA2/15/136\n130 these companies allegedly failed to respond to D1’s requests for the voluntary \nproduction of their documents thereafter (for example it was said that Alfatrader, \nwhich provided its bank statements in 2018, had apparently failed to respond to \nFieldfisher’s letters requesting documents in June 2021: Wright1/¶29 {H2/40/6}  and \nthe schedule at {H2/40.1/2}).  \n(2) Even more absurdly: ( i) in June 2021 D1 claimed that the failure to produce \ndocuments was because the other  “UBOs ” of the Lafferty Spreadsheets Companies \nhad not consented to the release of documents (notwithstanding the fact that these \npurported other “ UBOs ” had not objected to the provision of bank statements in \n2018): see {H2/40.1/2} (footnote 1); and ( ii) in September 2022, some of these \ncompanies continued to refuse to provide their documents (see {L/92.05/17}128). \nThis was a charade, procured by D1 to prevent documents which would undermine \nhis case being available to the Court.  \n(3) Primecap.

See Bank Opening/Sch. 2 {AA2/2/3} and {Day13/127:22} - \n{Day13/128:13}. Had this trial not been adjourned, the Bank would have been \nprovided with just 10.8% of the Primecap documents by the start of trial and 17.16% \nby the end of it. \n(4) PBC. See {Day5/73:11-24} and {Day13/128:14} - {Day13/132:23}: ( i) neither D1 \nnor D2 identified PBC as a custodian or mentioned it in their initial disclosure \ncertificates; ( ii) PBC was not approached until the Bank requested D1 to do so in \nDecember 2021, four years after proceedings began; ( iii) PBC does not appear to have \nbeen issued with a litigation hold during that four-year period or approached before \nthe deadline for disclosure in April 2021; and ( iv) it then transpired that its “ entire email \nserver along with its backup copies no longer exist ” {H4/34/5} (¶3.5.2). In circumstances \nwhere D1-2 own and control PBC, the Court should readily conclude that they either \nprocured or failed to prevent the deletion of its entire email server and all backups. \nInstead, they avoided identifying PBC as an important custodian in a bid to avoid the \nproduction of documents which would undermine their case.  \n(5) IK Volume Spreadsheets. See Bank Opening/¶¶189 {AA2/1/83}. D1’s selective and \nself-serving approach to disclosure is evidenced in the production of the IK Volume \nSpreadsheets. These documents were produced ( i) after the Bank had filed expert \nevidence questioning the reliability of the Petrol Station fuel sales figures used in the \n \n128  Lafferty Spreadsheets Companies can be found at rows 507, 517, 532, 537 and 560 of this schedule {L/92.01}. \nAA2/15/137\n131 2016 Valuation Reports; ( ii) by custodians who (with two exceptions) have not \nproduced any other documents in the proceedings; and ( iii) without any original \nmetadata. D1 belatedly addressed the IK Volume Spreadsheets in his valuation \nsubmissions at {AA3/2/15-17} (¶¶48-50), but the failure to disclose them before Mr \nBezant’s report on the valuation of the Petrol Stations – instead disclosing them at the \nsame time as Mr Kaczmarek’s report – and the failure to obtain any other documents \nfrom these custodians, remain unexplained.129 (We address the IK Volume \nSpreadsheets in Section N below). \n(d) D1’s (non-)disclosure from key lieutenants \n248 D1 has failed to give adequate disclosure from the key lieutenants involved in the fraud, in \nparticular Novikov, Gurieva, Melnyk, Dubilet and Yatsenko. The Bank’s hand-up at \n{AA6/10} sets out ( i) the number of disclosed documents for each of these individuals; ( ii) \nthe scope of each collection; ( iii) the excuses given by D1 (on his own and D2’s behalf) to \nexplain why proper collections were not undertaken; and ( iv) the orders made by the Court \n(see too {Day13/134:2} - {Day13/144:24}).  \n249 Taking these key custodians in turn: \n(1) Novikov. Novikov is said to have handed over 44,000 documents to Fieldfisher \nvoluntarily. But: ( i) D1 has disclosed only 142 documents of which Novikov is the \ncustodian (and only half of them pre-date nationalisation); ( ii) none of the documents \nfor which Novikov is the custodian is an email (notwithstanding that the 44,000 \ndocuments supposedly included documents from two of his email accounts \ninvboss@yahoo.com and invboss@gmail.com); ( iii) there are only c. 135 disclosed \nemails to/from Novikov’s invboss@primecap.co.cy email account (notwithstanding \nthat this was an account supposedly incorporated in the production of documents \nheld by Primecap); "}

D1’s solicitors wrote to Gurieva five times between February 2021 and \nAugust 2022 without any response (see {L/92.05/84}  (item 677)). On 16.11.22 the \nBank applied for an order that D1 seek disclosure of Gurieva’s documents {H1/74/2} \n(¶3(b)) and, on 6.12.22 she produced 22,454 documents to Fieldfisher: see \nLafferty21/¶10.8 {H2/56/6}. However: ( i) none of these documents were emails or \nother communications; and ( ii) she is said to have refused to provide her current \nmobile phone to D1’s solicitors to be imaged to collect documents created, sent or \nreceived on behalf of D1 (notwithstanding the fact that she worked as D1’s de facto  \nemployee from January 2018 in the production of the Lafferty Spreadsheets: see \nSection C2(3)  (¶94) above); and claimed not to retain any of the devices she used \nprior to 31.12.19 {L/150/2}.  \n(3) Melnyk. Melnyk provided some documents for disclosure to D3-8 and further \ndocuments to Fieldfisher (as set out in the Bank’s hand-up). However: ( i) of the four \nemail accounts Melnyk is known to have used (sergey.melnik@pbcua.com; \nmelnik@pbc.dp.ua; s.melnik@ua.fm; and melnik.sergey1@gmail.com), D3-8’s \nevidence is that he could only access the Gmail account: McNeill14/¶¶3.8.2 – 3.8.4 \n{H4/32/10}; ( ii) Melnyk’s “g eneral practice ” was allegedly to delete the entire content \nof each email account once or twice a year, without a back-up (McNeill14/¶3.8.2 \n(ibid.); (iii) the PBC server was wiped clear during the course of this litigation; ( iv) \nMelnyk allegedly refused to provide his mobile devices to be imaged; and (v) there has \nbeen no disclosure of any Melnyk documents from Sunaltezza.  \n(4) Dubilet. It is clear that Dubilet used email accounts in working for D1 and D2 (see \nhis use of the dn251062dav@gmail.com address when reporting to Novikov and \nYatsenko on D1’s meeting with Ms Rozhkova and Ms Gontareva on 7.7.16 \n{E14/309.1} and the same Gmail account to produce spreadsheets for D2 post-\nnationalisation: see  the email at {K5-A3/5/405} which attached the spreadsheet at \n{K5-D1/4/1}).

Despite ongoing contact with D1 and D2 following the Bank’s \nnationalisation, Dubilet is said to have failed to respond to any request for documents. \n(5) Yatsenko. He too clearly used a personal email account to conduct business associated \nwith D1-2 companies (see e.g. the use of his v.a.yatsenko@gmail.com address at \nSection G and {E14/309.1}) and was in WhatsApp contact with D1. Despite giving \n{AA2/15/68}\n{AA2/15/178}\nAA2/15/139\n133 witness statements on D1’s behalf on 2.11.21 and 17.12.21, he is said to have failed to \nrespond to D1’s request for documents on 28.10.21, 1.7.22, 5.8.22 and 31.8.22. It is, \nin that regard, remarkable that no-one from D1’s legal team apparently thought to \nchase him for documents whilst proofing him in advance of giving his trial witness \nstatements in October-December 2021. \n250 In summary, D1 has failed to give proper disclosure of the communications of his key \nlieutenants and nominees who were involved in the fraud. The Court should infer that, had \nhe given such disclosure, it would have undermined his case yet further. \n(2) D2’s disclosure failings \n251 We addressed D2’s disclosure at {Day4/58:11} ff. In this section we address ( i) D2’s \ndisclosure obligations; ( ii) D2’s disclosure from his personal document sources including \nemail accounts; ( iii) D2’s disclosure of WhatsApp and other instant messages; ( iv) D2’s \n(non)disclosure from third parties and key lieutenants; and ( v) D2’s response to the Bank’s \ncriticisms of his disclosure. \n(a) D2’s disclosure obligations  \n252 As set out above, D2 was required to give Model E disclosure for the issues relating to his \nownership and/or control of the Relevant Entities. D2’s Section 2 DRD explained that ( i) \ncertain of his electronic devices (iPads, iPhones, desktop computers etc.) had been imaged in \n2013-14 for the Pinchuk Proceedings and in 2019 for the Tatneft Proceedings; ( ii) he \nintended to seek documents from a limited set of third parties, being “ companies referenced in \nthe Particulars of Claim [of] which D2 admits any ownership or control ” as well as Primecap and \nSkadden (his previous solicitors in this litigation); and ( iii) his only other document sources \nwere Anischenko and his secretaries: {A4/8/1-8}. As to that:  \n(1) D2 failed to identify PBC, Sunaltezza and Grizal as custodians or corporate services \nproviders from which he would obtain documents. As set out above, the Court should \nconclude that these were deliberate decisions. \n(2) D2 also failed to identify various email accounts and other potential sources of \ndocuments. He says that this was a case of forgetfulness; but the Court should again \nconclude that it was deliberate.  \n(b) D2 personal devices, email accounts and documents \n253 Mobile phones. D2 failed to give adequate disclosure from his mobile phones and other \ndevices.  \nAA2/15/140\n134 (1) Failure to identify relevant devices. D2’s 1st Disclosure Certificate purported to list the \ndevices which had been imaged in the Pinchuk/Tatneft Proceedings and any further \ndevices: {A4/32/6}. It did not list any HTC devices. But one of D2’s disclosed emails \nto Dubilet at {E3/120.1L} records “ sent from my HTC ”. On 23.2.23, the Bank asked \nD2 about this HTC device {L/141/1}. Enyo responded on 9.3.23 stating “[ t]o the best \nof his knowledge and recollection, Mr Bogolyubov used an HTC device in 2014 but does not have \nany specific knowledge or recollection as to his use of the device, including where or how he obtained \nit…he does not know precisely when he no longer used it ”: {L/146/1}. \n(2) Further devices not imaged or searched.

{"start": 388500, "text": "e {L/141/1}. Enyo responded on 9.3.23 stating “[ t]o the best \nof his knowledge and recollection, Mr Bogolyubov used an HTC device in 2014 but does not have \nany specific knowledge or recollection as to his use of the device, including where or how he obtained \nit…he does not know precisely when he no longer used it ”: {L/146/1}. \n(2) Further devices not imaged or searched. D2’s 1st Disclosure Certificate also records \nthat “[ m]obile devices that were available in 2014 were imaged [in the Pinchuk Proceedings ] where \nit was possible to do so. Mr Bogolyubov understands that a number of mobile phones in his possession \nat that time could not be imaged and were searched manually by Skadden. Two of these phones were \n… retrieved …. ” {A4/32/9}. D2 therefore had further mobile devices which he used \nin 2013-14 and which were not imaged for the purposes of the Pinchuk Proceedings \nand were not the subject of any document collection for these proceedings. \n(3) Discarded iPhones. D2’s 1st Disclosure Certificate further records that “[ i]n addition to \nthe mobile phones listed in Table 1 and above, Mr Bogolyubov has used various mobile phones from \ntime to time. Except for his current iPhone [an iPhone 12 Pro Max ], Mr Bogolyubov no longer has \nany previously used phones in his possession (beyond those devices collected for the purposes of the \nPinchuk Proceedings…) Mr Bogolyubov’s long-standing practice is to get a new iPhone every time a \nnew model is released and to give his old iPhone away (for example to his children or to friends) .” \n{A4/32/9}. As to that:  \n(a) D2 says that he did not use any of the devices collected in the Pinchuk \nProceedings once they were returned to him having been imaged {A4/32/7} \n(¶13). It follows that D2 had a ‘new’ iPhone from at least June 2014 (replacing \nthe ones he had handed in to be imaged in the Pinchuk Proceedings). Between \nJune 2014 and September 2020 (when D2’s current iPhone 12 Pro Max model \nwas released by Apple), D2 would have purchased, used and discarded seven \niPhones, as follows: \nPhone No. Release date (approx.) Discarded model \n1 10.9.13 iPhone 5130 \n \n130  Assuming D2 handed in his iPhone 5 to Skadden in or about June 2014, he would have needed to purchase a \nnew iPhone 5 to replace it, before the iPhone 6 was released in September 2014. \nAA2/15/141\n135 Phone No. Release date (approx.) Discarded model \n2 9.9.14 iPhone 6 \n3 9.9.15 iPhone 6s \n4 7.9.16 iPhone 7 \n5 12.9.17 iPhone 8 / iPhone X \n6 12.9.18 iPhone XR / XS / XS Max  \n7 10.9.19 iPhone 11 / 11 Pro / 11 \nPro Max \n8 13.10.20 iPhone 12 Pro Max \n(b) It cannot seriously be disputed that D2 gave away a large number of phones: \nEnyo’s own analysis is that “it is therefore likely that there were three phones between \n[26.9.13 and 30.6.17 ] that were given away by our client ” {L/64.2/2} (¶1(d)). \n(c) Importantly: ( i) D2 disposed of three phones during the currency of these \nproceedings (phones  5, 6 and 7 given away in c. Sept/Oct 2018, 2019 and 2020) \n-  they may well have contained messages going back a number of years (phone \n8 had messages going back to July 2017); ( ii) phone 4 was disposed of in c. \nSeptember 2017 (when the Shulman proceedings were ongoing) – these \nproceedings made allegations relating to conduct in 2013-2016,131 and so (on \nany view) this phone too should have been retained; and ( iii) phones 1 - 3 were \ngiven away during the currency of the Pinchuk/Tatneft proceedings.132   \n(d) The most striking result of D2’s conduct is the gap in his disclosure of \nWhatsApp and other messages. The latest message collected in the Pinchuk \nProceedings from D2’s mobile devices was sent on 26.9.13 {L/64.2/2} (¶1(a)) \nand only two sets of SMS messages/iMessages have been disclosed (other \ninstant messages such as WhatsApp do not appear to have been collected). The \nearliest messages collected in these proceedings from D2’s devices is from June \n2017 (see Enyo’s analysis at {L/64.2/2} and {A4/32/9}). \n254 Cloud storage and "}

The latest message collected in the Pinchuk \nProceedings from D2’s mobile devices was sent on 26.9.13 {L/64.2/2} (¶1(a)) \nand only two sets of SMS messages/iMessages have been disclosed (other \ninstant messages such as WhatsApp do not appear to have been collected). The \nearliest messages collected in these proceedings from D2’s devices is from June \n2017 (see Enyo’s analysis at {L/64.2/2} and {A4/32/9}). \n254 Cloud storage and D2’s current iPhone. D2’s 1st Disclosure Certificate states that his current \niPhone 12 Pro Max “ holds data either on the phone itself or on the iCloud dating back to July 2017 ” \n \n131  {I3/19/32} ( ¶¶90-94). \n132  D2’s counsel took a technical point on Day 7 {Day7/70:8} - {Day7/73:2}, viz. that although phones 1 - 3 had \nbeen disposed of during the Pinchuk/Tatneft proceedings, they could not contain disclosable documents \nbecause of the search date ranges being applied in those proceedings. Whether that is correct probably depends \non whether later documents might have been or become relevant to the proceedings. But it does not matter \nmuch matter given the litigation hold breaches at ( i) and ( ii). \nAA2/15/142\n136 {A4/32/9} (¶2). So that was not a source from which to recreate D2’s missing messages or \ndocuments from the period c. June 2014 - June 2017. And in any event, D2 claimed he could \nnot access his iCloud account because he could not remember the device with which it was \nassociated {L/75.1/3} (¶2.8) and then said he “ has never knowingly used iCloud ” and does not \nhave an iCloud associated with his current iPhone {L/110.1/2} (¶¶4.1-4.3). \n255 WhatsApp, text and other instant messages. D2’s disclosure of his instant messages from \nhis devices has been seriously inadequate: \n(1) SMS (text) messages: The only SMS messages disclosed by D2 are 31 messages with \nMarkova (14.4.11 – 9.10.12) {K5-E/1} and 23 messages and iMessages with \nMarangos (12.1.11 - 2.10.12) {K5-E/1.1}. D2 has not explained why, despite the \nimages taken in the Pinchuk Proceedings, he has disclosed no other SMS or other \nmessages for the period before June 2014 (when the phones were imaged in the \nPinchuk Proceedings). We know D2 was sending SMS messages to Dubilet and others \nin the period before June 2014 because they are recorded in his call logs ({K5-E/4}133 \n– ‘SMS’ entries in the ‘bill category’ column).  \n(2) Signal: The Bank discovered that D2 used the messaging app Signal to communicate \nbecause one of Anischenko’s WhatsApp messages to D2 read “ I have sent you a message  \nvia Signal ” (24.3.16 {K5-A3/1/190}). D2’s use of Signal was not mentioned in his 3rd \nDisclosure Certificate ( cp. {A4/68/2}). Under pressure from the Bank,134 D2 belatedly \nclaimed that ( i) he started using Signal in early 2016; ( ii) his Signal messages were not \ncollected as part of his disclosure exercise {L/98.1/3} (¶¶9-11); ( iii) when Signal was \n(re)installed on his iPhone 12, no messages were available {L/110.1/3 }; and ( iv) D2 \n“does not recall using Signal with any individual relevant to the proceedings ” (see Elliss5/¶85 \n{H3/22/15}). That self-serving assertion should be given no weight, not least given \nD2’s highly unreliable memory. It is clear that this is a messaging app that D2 did use \n(see the Anischenko message) and from which no messages are available to the Court. \n(3) Viber: The Bank discovered that D2 used Viber to communicate with (at least) Dubilet \nbecause one of D2’s disclosed emails shows that the latter proposed to D2 that he \nshould use Viber {E2/200.1} and later emailed him to say he had sent information \nvia Viber {E3/18.1}. On 23.2.22 the Bank applied for an order that D2 search for \n \n133  See e.g. at {K5-E/4/22} and {K5-E/6/9} – numbers used by Dubilet include +3806 7522 3030 (see {K5-\nA1/17/1}). \n134  See HL’s letters to Enyo 12.9.22 {L/92.1/4} (¶¶3.5-3.6) and 21.9.22 {L/95.2/4} (¶4.5) and the Bank’s \napplication dated 16.11.22 seeking dis"}

But despite the fact D2 clearly used Viber in the relevant period, \nincluding to communicate with Dubilet, he has not disclosed any Viber messages.  \n(4) Gaps in WhatsApp messages. D2’s disclosure of his WhatsApp messages has revealed \nsignificant gaps in those which have survived: \n(a) D2 instant messages timeline. The Bank has created a timeline for the message \nchains disclosed by D2 and Anischenko similar to that which it handed up in \nrespect of D1’s instant messages: see Appendix E1 . It shows that nearly all of \nthe chains relate to periods after nationalisation. The exceptions are messages \ndisclosed by, and involving, Anischenko – his chats with each of D2, Marangos, \nMarkova and Novikov (although, tellingly, even the D2 – Anischenko \nexchanges do not commence until 27.9.14, i.e. after the last of the Relevant \nDrawdowns and Unreturned Prepayments). \n(b) D2 / Anischenko messages. D2’s current iPhone should include WhatsApp \nmessages with Anischenko from July 2017 onwards (the period for which it \napparently holds data). For the period 18.9.18 – 9.4.21, Anischenko has \ndisclosed his messages with D2 from his iPhone {K5-A3/5/341-578} but D2 \nhas disclosed none {L/91.1/4} (¶4.4(c)). Enyo could offer no explanation for \nthis. They say that D2 did not delete messages, but cannot explain why messages \nthat plainly existed no longer do {TR2-C/7/55 } (part 1) {L/98.1/5 } (part 2). \n(c) D2 / Novikov: As above, D2’s current iPhone should include messages from \nJuly 2017 to 26.5.21.  He has however disclosed no messages with Novikov for \nthe period July 2017 to 26.4.18, despite disclosing c. 849 messages (including \nsystem messages, missed calls etc.) in the c. three years that follow {L/91.1/4} \n(¶4.4(a)). Enyo could offer no explanation for this, beyond the assertion that \nD2 did not delete messages; they did not deny that D2 exchanged messages with \nNovikov in this period {TR2-C/7/55 } (part 1) {L/98.1/5 } (part 2).  \n256 Call records. See {Day4/89:1} - {Day4/92:10};135 {Day5/56:16} - {Day5/57:18}. The Bank \nwas forced to make an application for disclosure of D2’s call logs (see Wales14/¶¶34-37, 45 \n \n135  As well as the D2 – Markova referred to in the D2 Document Presentation, there is a further D2 – Marangos \nSMS exchange (14.4.11 – 23.4.12): see ¶255(1). \n{AA2/19}\nAA2/15/144\n138 {H1/56/10}). D2’s evidence in response was that “ I do not understand why the Bank considers \nthat call records will have any real evidential value in these proceedings ” Elliss1/¶¶39(b)-(c) \n{H3/13/14}. In the event, the disclosed call logs have significant evidential value, as they \nshow D2 in frequent contact with Novikov, Dubilet and D1 in the period 1.2.14 – 31.5.14 \n(see Section C2 ). However: \n(1) D2 has not disclosed any notes made during any calls or meetings. It is inherently \nimplausible that D2 wrote down nothing in the course of his eight hours of calls with \nDubilet and four hours of calls with Novikov. \n(2) Cellular network call records have only been provided by D2 for a four-month period \nin 2014, and for a short period in December 2016 – January 2017. \n(3) Importantly, while D1-2 made extensive use of WhatsApp, no call records are \navailable for WhatsApp calls with the availabl"}

The Bank has addressed D2’s failure to give adequate disclosure from his \nemail accounts at Bank Opening/¶184 {AA2/1/80-82}. We summarise the position below:  \nEmail account Disclosure summary \ngbb2001@gmail.com  D2 claimed to have forgotten his password and password \nrecovery information  { H3/11/9 } (para 32(a)); disclosure \nonly obtained following the Bank’s 1782 Application136 in \nCalifornia against Google. \n Google produced 1,197 emails dated 12.10.11 – 30.8.21 \n{L/52}. \n Only six emails produced by D2 from this account, each of \nwhich pre-dates August 2013. \ngennadiy.bb@gmail.com   D2 claimed to have forgotten his password and password \nrecovery information { H3/11/9 } (para 32(b)); disclosure \nonly obtained following the Bank’s 1782 Application in \nCalifornia against Google. \n Google produced 8,152 emails dated 25.2.16 – 27.9.21 \n{L/52}. \n \n136  Although D2 claimed to have forgotten his passwords to the “[ t]wo Google Mail accounts ”, he did not seek \nassistance from Google: {H3/11/10}. The Court therefore directed D2 to execute a mandate directing Google \nto provide D2’s solicitors with relevant emails, so that the Bank could apply for an order against Google \n{A6/63/3} (¶8). \n{AA2/15/56}\nAA2/15/145\n139  No emails produced by Google for period before 25.2.16 \ndespite the email account clearly being in use before that date \n(as evidenced by disclosure from other sources137).  \n There is a gap between 26.6.14 (Pinchuk image date) and \n25.2.16 (earliest email disclosed by Google).  \n To be inferred the contents of the account were deleted on \nor about 25.2.16 ( i.e. between the Pinchuk Proceedings \nsettling and the Tatneft Proceedings starting). \ngennadiy.bb@gbbmail.com   Email account identified from the documents produced by \nGoogle as the recovery address for the \ngennadiy.bb@gmail.com address; D2 claimed to have \n“forgotten this address ” {A4/113/11-12} (¶40.2).  \n Email account used in 2015–2017: Bank Opening/¶184(5) \n{AA2/1/81} {E8/75} {E17/153.1} {E17/155.1}. \n Email account was deleted by Primecap in mid-2017 \n(according to explanation in D2’s supplemental disclosure \ncertificate on 1.7.22 { A4/113/12 }, which also falsely stated \nthat it was only used for the Pinchuk Proceedings). \n No documents produced by D2 from this account.  \ngbb2001@mail.ru   Email address identified from the documents produced by \nGoogle as the recovery email for the gbb2001@gmail.com \naccount {L/52}.  \n The address was initially identified as gb*****@ma**.** , and \nD2 was “ unable to recall the address in full ” {PTR-B6/2/479 }.  \n Later D2 said “ … the GBB2001@mail.ru  address never \nexisted [sic]. [D2] does not recall why he included these details in the \nsubscriber information [provided to Google ]” {L/75.1/2 } (¶2.4).  \n Highly unlikely D2 would have made up address when giving \nsubscriber information to Google.  \n No documents produced by D2 from this account. \n258 Other personal documents. Other notable failings in D2’s disclosure exercise include his:  \n(1) Failure to produce any diaries or similar documents. As with D1, it is inconceivable \nthat someone (Anischenko, or his secretaries) did not keep documents to track who \nhe was supposed to be meeting and when. \n(2) Failure to produce any notes made during any calls or meetings.  \n \n137  In particular: ( i) the Pinchuk image demonstrates that it was in use between 1.1.13 and 26.6.14; ( ii) D1 (via  the \nPrimecap disclos"}

D2 has disclosed neither of these emails from his own sources {E9/191.1}. On \n{Day4/109:10-24}, the Bank made a minor correction to the figures in Bank Opening/¶184(2) {AA2/1/80}. \nAA2/15/146\n140 (c) D2’s disclosure from third parties \n259 D2 has limited his collections from third parties. We make the following points:  \n(1) PBC: Like D1, D2 failed to identify PBC as a custodian.  \n(2) Key lieutenants: Unlike D1, D2 failed to identify any of Novikov, Gurieva, Melnyk, \nDubilet, Chmona or Yatsenko as custodians (D2’s connections with these individuals \nare addressed in Sections C2 and D3  above).  \n(3) Grizal and Sunaltezza. See Section B2  above. D2 failed to identify Grizal or \nSunaltezza as custodians of documents under his control, notwithstanding their \nimportance as the employers of many ex-PBC nominees. \n(4) Primecap. D2 agreed with D1 that D1 would take the lead on the Primecap disclosure \nexercise (and apparently informally agreed to pay 50% of the costs of that exercise). \nHe cannot escape responsibility for the regrettable way that exercise was conducted. \n260 D2 has told brazen lies to the Court in his effort to avoid giving disclosure from third parties:  \n(1) On 16.11.22, the Bank applied for an order that D2 use his best endeavours to access/ \nsearch Melnyk’s devices, email accounts and mobile phones used in the period 1.1.13 \n– 31.12.19 for documents sent, received or produced on D2’s behalf {G1/76/1}.  \n(2) D2 resisted that application, saying as follows (Elliss5 {H3/22}):  \nD2 has “no right to access and search [Mr Melnyk’s] devices, accounts and \ntelephones…” (¶25);  \n“As regards Mr Melnyk, [D2] accepts that on occasion Mr Melnyk may have sent or \nreceived documents during the Relevant Period on [D2’s] behalf in relation to the \nmanagement of his assets but, again, to the best of [D2’s] recollection and belief, this \nwas done in the course of his employment at PBC” (¶26);  \n“Mr Melnyk is (and, during the Relevant Period, was) employed by PBC” (¶51);  \n“Mr Melnyk did not act on [D2’s] behalf outside the course of his employment at PBC” \n(¶53). \n(3) Orally, D2 resisted the application on the basis that he did not control Melnyk’s \ndocuments: see e.g. {G2/106/11} (¶¶32-34)). The Bank’s application was adjourned \nwith liberty to restore {A6/107/4} (¶3). \n(4) It is now clear that ( i) D2 employed Melnyk from mid-2017 onwards via Sunaltezza; \n(ii) Melnyk acted for D2 and D2’s companies while an employee of Sunaltezza; and \n(iii) D2 controls Sunaltezza’s documents (as is apparent from his ability to produce its \nbank statements and other documents). See Enyo’s letter of 23.9.23 {L/210}. \n{AA2/15/56}\n{AA2/15/97}\n{AA2/15/34}\nAA2/15/147\n141 (5) In the circumstances, D2 plainly could and should have accepted that he controlled \nMelnyk’s documents held by Sunaltezza. Instead, he sought to conceal Melnyk’s \nemployment with Sunaltezza and brazenly lied to his solicitors and the Court. \n(d) D2’s Corrections Schedule and Disclosure Timeline \n261 D2’s Corrections Schedule purports to identify 14 errors in the Bank’s oral submissions in \nrelation to disclosure. They are all addressed in the Bank’s counter-schedule at Appendix \nB2. But by way of summary, the points are either wrong (see, e.g., the complai"}

They are all addressed in the Bank’s counter-schedule at Appendix \nB2. But by way of summary, the points are either wrong (see, e.g., the complaint about the \nuse of the words ‘delete’ and ‘disposed’ when these were used by Enyo) or footling.  \n262 The D2 Disclosure Timeline covers emails, call logs and instant messages (to a partial extent, \nin both senses of the word) and purports to show “ the time periods over which D2 collected key \ncategories of documents either from D2’s repositories or those of his custodians ” {AA6/20} and that “ there \nare no gaps - throughout the period there is data, open data, provided by D2 which provides insight into what \nhe was doing and who he was speaking to ” (CMKC {Day7/70:1-3}). As the Bank’s version of the \nD2 Disclosure Timeline at Appendix E2  shows, the timeline omits D2’s personal sources \nfrom which D2 did not collect documents and does not include the number of documents \nwhich have in fact been collected and disclosed. \n(e) D2’s disclosure: summary \n263 D2’s election not to give evidence leaves the Court with no testimony from him to explain \nthe numerous disclosure failures identified above. In those circumstances, and given the \npervasive and wide-ranging nature of the failures, the Court should infer that, in addition to \nhis general policy of discarding devices and avoiding document record retention, D2 has \ndeliberately and tactically sought to evade his disclosure obligations in multiple ways: by \ngiving away iPhones even during the currency of these and other proceedings; claiming to \nhave forgotten passwords to email accounts/iCloud, and deleting emails; failing to identify \nrelevant mobile devices (the HTC device) and email accounts (the @gbbmail.com, @mail.ru \naccounts); failing to identify relevant third-party custodians; giving false evidence to avoid a \nspecific disclosure order; and failing to produce relevant hard copy documents promptly.  \n264 As a result, and given that D2 also tendered neither himself nor any other witness to explain \nthe position, the Court is faced with an evidential desert in relation to the detail of D2’s \ncommunications in that period. The very limited record of his communications which has \nsurvived consists of some emails from the gennadiy.bb@gmail.com account; the seven pages \nof SMS messages; call logs for a limited period; and limited disclosure from other sources. \n{AA2/16/8}\n{AA2/19}\nAA2/15/148\n142 In those circumstances, it is appropriate for the Court to draw the adverse inferences set out \nin Section B1(2) (¶47) above. \n(3) Lack of originating instructions to Primecap, PBC and the CSPs138 \n265 There is a final point that applies to D1-2: Primecap frequently sent “ please execute ”-style \nemails to the CSPs which administered non-Ukrainian entities (including D3-8: see Bank \nOpening/Sch. 5 {AA2/2/13-20}) which, on occasion, can be traced back to PBC. But the \ntrail stops there. There has been no disclosure of how Primecap or the PBC Nominees were \ninstructed to execute documents; and this is to be contrasted with the position following the \nWFO where – in relation to a limited set of admitted D1-2 companies – “ Authorisation \nLetters ” were provided to CSPs and “ Beneficiary Instructions ” were given to the Nominees, \nseemingly to provide a paper trail and to give reassurance to the CSPs who had acted on an \ninformal basis in the past: see ¶119, 137.

Instead, we address the following:  \n(1) Section F1 : The absence of any dispute on the key features of the Misappropriation.  \n(2) Section F2 : D2’s suggestion that there was a “ wider” fraud at the Bank and his \n“alternative explanation ” for the Misappropriation.  \n(3) Section F3 : D1-2’s benefit from the Misappropriation.  \n(4) Section F4 : The Lafferty Spreadsheets. \nF1 THE BANK’S CASE AND THE DEFENDANTS ’ POSITION  \n(1) The Relevant Loans, the Relevant Drawdowns and the Borrowers139  \n267 It is not disputed that:  \n(1) Between 3.4.13 and 21.8.14, 134 Relevant Loans were entered into between the Bank \nand 50 Borrowers: see LOI/¶¶6-11 {AA1/3/4-6}.

None \nof the Ds have mounted a case that the Borrowers were genuine third-party entities \ninterested in borrowing money for independent commercial activity: Bank \nOpening/ ¶195 {AA2/1/85-86}. \n268 The absence of any dispute in relation to these matters can be demonstrated by: \n(1) D2 Opening/¶7 said: “[ a]ny ‘Scheme’ plainly operated in a manner that was clandestine and \ncontrary to all principles of prudent banking ” {AA4/1/7}. D1-8’s ‘Use of Funds’ defence \nimplicitly accepts that the Relevant Loans were just “ technical disbursements ” (CMKC \n{Day7/38:14}) which formed part of a wider “ circular movement of money completely under \nthe control of the Bank ” (CMKC {Day7/40:3}). Put another way “[ Money is ] circling as \nmoney dressed up as lending ” (CMKC {Day7/43:22}). D3-8 adopted D1-2’s position: \n“there was a longstanding loan recycling scheme in operation ” (TPKC {Day7/78:20}).  \n \n140  See Section A3(6)(b) or (c) and (7)(e) or (f) of the Borrower SOFs. For example: {F1/2/4} (AEF), {F1/3/3} \n(Agroprom), {F1/4/4} (Alfatrader).

Indeed, D2 avers that \nDubilet is the “ most likely candidate ” to have approved the Misappropriation, apparently \non a frolic of his own and without D1-2’s approval (D2 Opening/¶¶7-8 {AA4/1/6}).  \n(3) It is common ground that the Relevant Loans were not formally put before the \nSupervisory Board for approval. The loans should have been approved by the \nSupervisory Board in accordance with the provisions of the Bank’s Charter (cl. \n9.3.3(45), for loans over US$500,000 with related parties {C1/211/15}) or the Credit \nCommittee Regulations (for any loans over US$2m {E4/58/9}).  \n(4) D2 describes the Borrowers as “ a flotilla of convenient vessels ” (CMKC {Day7/24:12}) \nand Uniks as an “ empty vessel ” (CMKC {Day7/26:16}). Indeed, D1-8’s acceptance that \nthere was a fraudulent ‘loan recycling’ scheme negates the notion that the Borrowers \nwere genuine third parties with resources to repay their borrowing. \n269 As addressed in detail in Section G , the Bank’s case, supported by overwhelming and wholly \nunanswered evidence, is that the Borrowers were all owned and/or controlled by D1-2, and \nthat control was exercised via PBC (Ukrainian Borrowers) and Primecap (Cypriot \nBorrowers) (POC/¶12B-C, 19A(f) {A1/2/4}). Again, there is no dispute here (or, at most, \nonly half-hearted challenge): \n(1) The list of PBC and Primecap nominees used to operate these companies is \nunchallenged. \n(2) There no longer appears to be any dispute that individuals at PBC assisted BOK \nemployees in the mechanics of the Misappropriation. For instance: \n(a) D2 positively states that “ the evidence shows that it was in fact employees of the Bank, \nPrimecap and/or PBC who administered the ‘Scheme’ and/or determined how the Borrowers \nparticipated in the ‘Scheme’ ”: D2 Opening/¶160(8) {AA4/1/67}. \n(b) The agreed Uniks Chronology {AA1/10} demonstrates that BOK and PBC \nemployees (particularly Barsuk) worked side-by-side in administering the \nBorrowers and Intermediary Borrowers.  \n(3) D2’s case is that the “[ t]he corporate borrowers themselves appear to have been fungible under the \ncontrol of the Bank without any reference to the individual director or officers of the entities concerned ”: \nD2 Opening/¶21 {AA4/1/11}. \n{AA2/15/178}\nAA2/15/151\n145 270 Against that background, the Court should have no hesitation in concluding that: \n(1) The Relevant Loan Agreements were shams: they were never intended to constitute \ngenuine agreements and were put in place to extract money from the Bank; \n(2) That money was extracted by the 270 Relevant Drawdowns authorised by the \nindividuals on the ECC and executed by individuals at BOK; and \n(3) Consequently, US$1.9bn was stolen from the Bank in 2013-14, and the theft was \ndisguised as a series of loans. \n(2) The Relevant Supply Agreements and D3-8141 \n271 It is not disputed that: \n(1) D3-8 entered into 54 Relevant Supply Agreements ( “RSAs” ) with the Borrowers \nbetween May and August 2014. \n(2) The Borrowers made prepayments of US$1.9bn to D3-8 pursuant to those purported \nagreements between 28.5.14 and 1.9.14. \n(3) Those prepayments were not returned by D3-8 to those Borrowers.  \n(4) D3-5 had no intention of, and no prospect of, themselves supplying the goods under \nthe RSAs: LOI/¶19 {AA1/3/9}.

A token attempt is made in the pleadings to say that \nD6-8 did intend to supply their goods (D3-8Def/¶19(2) {A1/20/12 }) but no \nwitnesses have been proffered to explain how, when or where, and there is no genuine \ndocumentary evidence to support that proposition.  \n272 It is the Bank’s case that the RSAs were shams. D3-5 have never sought to defend the terms \nof the RSAs and the Bank’s case that the terms are commercially inexplicable is essentially \nunanswered (see POC/¶25 {A1/2/15-19}, Bank Opening/¶¶212-215 {AA2/1/95-96}). \nNor have D3-5 sought to defend the allegation that they were shell entities of no substance \n(see POC/¶24 {A1/2/15}, Bank Opening/¶216 {AA2/1/96-97}). \n273 D3-5’s case is instead that they entered into the RSAs as agents of their Alleged Principals \npursuant to the Alleged Agency Agreements, while D6-8’s pleaded case is that they were \nactive in the oil markets and could have delivered oil pursuant to their respective RSAs: \nD3-8Def/¶19 {A1/20/11-12}. That pleaded case assumes that the RSAs were genuine \nsupply agreements to be honoured either by the Alleged Principals or by D6-8.  \n \n141  See Bank Opening/F2/¶¶207-225 {AA2/1/94-99}. \nAA2/15/152\n146 274 It is unclear whether that case is maintained in light of Ds’ submissions at trial: \n(1) D3-8 opened their case on the basis that “ there was a long-running recycling scheme ..., … \nsomebody was left holding the outstanding supply agreement, and that’s my clients. It is what I would \ncall the game of hot potato. The hot potato was being quickly flung person to person and then as at \nAugust 2014 we had the misfortune to be holding the hot potato ” (TPKC {Day7/87:3-12}). \nThat submission destroys D3-8’s pleaded case that the RSAs were genuine contracts \nfor the cross-border sale of vast quantities of commodities/equipment.  \n(2) D3-8 also adopted the Use of Funds Defence so as to contend that the Unreturned \nPrepayments either were not funded by Relevant Drawdowns at all or (if they were) \nthe funds “ went back to the Bank ” (TPKC {Day7/98:8}). Again, that is not consistent \nwith the RSAs constituting genuine agreements. \n(3) D2 has likewise rubbished D3-8’s pleaded case that the RSAs were genuine: “ The true \npurpose of the ‘Unreturned’ Prepayments was not to pay for a non-existent RSA but instead to ensure \nthe immediate return of the money to the Bank in a so-called ‘technical disbursement’ ” (D2 \nOpening/¶18 {AA4/1/10}, emphasis added). D2’s position is that the RSAs were \npart of a “ paperwork shuffle ” (CMKC {Day7/45:19}) and the documents can be \nexplained as “ Bank employees were ... using the appearance of supply agreements and prepayments \nto get around restrictions on lending in foreign currency …” (D2 Opening/¶55.1 {AA4/1/24}). \n(4) D1’s (abandoned) trial evidence from Yatsenko positively averred that the supply \nagreements were shams, put in place to disguise the movement of US dollars to entities \nor accounts outside Ukraine “ even though it was understood that these [the supply agreements ] \ndid not reflect the commercial reality of the transaction ” and that “ no supply of goods was expected ”: \nYatsenko1/¶46 {B2/4/7}. \n275 D3-5’s reliance on the Alleged Agency Agreements is addressed further at Section K  below. \nAs the Bank has pleaded, those agreements are plainly also shams, just like the RSAs \n(Reply/¶8 {A1/25/17-18}, Bank Opening/¶217 {AA2/1/97}): \n(1) D3-8 and the Alleged Principals were owned and controlled by D1-2, and D1-2’s \nknowledge is attributable to them: P"}

It follows that D3-8 \nare attributed with knowledge of the Misappropriation and the sham nature of the \nRSAs. \n(2) D3-8’s case is that their purported UBOs were “ the persons with power to control their \nrespective companies ”: D3-8 RRFI/¶1(3) {A2/46/2}. Not, it seems, the directors or \n{AA2/15/285}\nAA2/15/153\n147 UBOs of the Alleged Principals. The purported UBOs of D3-5 were PBC employees \nwho also held interests in the Borrowers and (in Melnyk’s case) was intimately \ninvolved in the mechanics of the fraud. The Court should reject the proposition that \nMelnyk, Pugach, Ivlev, Yesipova and Trykulych did not know that the RSAs were \nshams put in place to disguise the illicit movement of money.  \n(3) The Alleged Agency Agreements do not assist. The purported UBOs of the Alleged \nPrincipals were yet further PBC employees: again, the Court should reject the \nsuggestion that Trykulych (Hangli), Kolobkov (Brimmilton) and Riazantseva (Collard) \n{A2/46/3} – all also purported UBOs of Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers – \ndid not know that the RSAs were shams. Indeed, Trykulych is said to have been the \nUBO not just of D3’s Alleged Principal, Hangli, but also of D3 itself, and of 13 of the \nBorrowers (Bank Opening/¶484(3) {AA2/1/194}), so it is inconceivable that she did \nnot know that the RSAs were shams.  \n(4) The Court should reject any notion that D3-8 could have been involved in the game \nof “hot potato ” without appreciating the sham nature of the agreements they executed. \n(5) The fact that the RSAs were “ considered ” in the collusive 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings \ncannot be prayed in aid of D3-8’s case ( cp. D3-8 Opening/¶¶38-39 {AA5/1/20-21}). \nOn the contrary, PBC and Primecap’s ability to procure the collusive production of \nsham letters and other documents by D3-8 and the Borrowers to support those \nproceedings demonstrates the sham nature of the RSAs: see Reply/¶9B {A1/25/18-\n19} and the chronologies at Bank Opening/Sch. 5 {AA2/2/13-20}. \n276 In support of its case that the RSAs were shams the Bank further relies on: \n(1) D1-2’s ownership and/or control of D3-8 (see Section G6 below);  \n(2) The Borrowers’ lack of substance (which is undisputed: see Section F1  above); \n(3) The role played by BOK, Primecap and PBC in administering this part of the fraud: \nsee the Uniks Chronology, and the chronologies at Bank Opening/Sch. 5 \n{AA2/2/13-20}, and D2 Opening/¶160(8) {AA4/1/67} (quoted above); and \n(4) The consistent treatment of the RSAs in the Kazantsev Spreadsheet and Gurieva \nSpreadsheet, addressed at Section F2 below.  \n{AA2/15/200}\n{AA2/15/149}\n{AA2/15/163}\nAA2/15/154\n148 (3) Relevant Drawdowns, recycling and Unreturned Prepayments142 \n277 There is no dispute that:  \n(1) The Bank’s transactional data records c. 90-day cycles of prepayments and returns of \nprepayments under supply agreement references between the Borrowers and suppliers \nover the course of 2013-14;  \n(2) The prepayments were funded by Relevant Drawdowns;  \n(3) The 90-day cycles were adopted to comply with Ukrainian currency control \nregulations;  \n(4) The pattern of 90-day cycles ended on or about 1.9.14 with US$1.9bn of Unreturned \nPrepayments recorded as outstanding under the RSAs from D3-8 to the Borrowers; \nand \n(5) Applying the Bank’s Methodology, the Relevant Drawdowns were the source of the \nUnreturned Prepayments. \nThe dispute between the parties relates to the significance of that pattern of transactions for \nthe Bank’s case, the loss"}

We address that point in Section \nM below. \n278 Confirmation that these points are undisputed comes from: \n(1) D1 Opening/¶9 {AA3/1/9}: “ The Bank’s transaction data records that, in the case of each of \nthe Relevant Loans, specific drawdowns (the ‘Relevant Drawdowns’) were advanced for the purpose \nof funding the Relevant Borrower’s acquisition of certain goods from one or other of D3-D8 (the \n‘Defendant Suppliers’) under a supply agreement (together the ‘Relevant Supply Agreements’). The \nRelevant Borrowers made prepayments for the goods which were not returned (the ‘Unreturned \nPrepayments’) and received no goods from the Defendant Suppliers ”. See too {Day6/3:19} - \n{Day6/4:2}. \n(2) Mr Yatsenko’s (abandoned) evidence which set out how the Bank used sham supply \nagreements to evade Ukrainian currency control regulations {B2/4/6-7} (¶¶37-47). \n(3) Mr Davidson and Mr Steadman who agree (assuming it is appropriate to use the \nBank’s Methodology) that “ Relevant Drawdowns are shown in the transactional data as being \nthe source of the Unreturned Prepayments ”: AccountancyJR1/¶2.2 {D4/1/4}. \n \n142  See Bank Opening/F3/¶¶226-242 {AA2/1/100-106}. \n{AA2/15/358}\nAA2/15/155\n149 (4) D2 who contends that “ Bank employees were simply using the appearance of supply agreements \nand prepayments to get around restrictions on lending in foreign currency or to cover up breaches of \nthose restrictions ” (D2 Opening/¶55.1 {AA4/1/24}) and that “ Bank employees were \nattempting to arrange supply contracts and prepayments on a rolling basis to reset the 90-day period \nfor the return of foreign currency. [The documents ] also suggest that RSAs and Unreturned \nPrepayments were used in this way ” (D2 Opening/¶62 {AA4/1/28}).  \n(5) D2 claims that September 2014 was not the end of the ‘Scheme’ (“ the music does not stop \nin September 2014 ”: CMKC {Day7/43:21}). But he appears to accept that ( i) the 90-\nday cycles ended at that point with the Unreturned Prepayments outstanding between \nthe Borrowers and D3-8; and ( ii) the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings were instituted “ to \navoid substantial penalties under the foreign currency regulations if prepayments were not recorded as \nbeing returned ”: D2 Opening/¶68 {AA4/1/30}. So there is no dispute that that music \ndid stop. It is also undisputed that the BOK employees undertaking the scheme for \nD1-2 recorded the halt through the ending of the Kazantsev Spreadsheets and the \nlater creation of the Gurieva Spreadsheet.  \n(6) D3-8’s position is that there was a “ transmutational moment ” in September 2014 (TPKC \n{Day7/87:16}).  \n(4) The purported security for the Relevant Loans143 \n279 The Bank’s case that the Relevant Loans were the subject of sham security in the form of \nRSA Pledges, the Share Pledges and/or LFSA Pledges has not been disputed. Indeed, any \nsuggestion that the Relevant Loans were adequately secured is fundamentally inconsistent \nwith D1-8’s position that there was a loan recycling scheme in operation, and that the RSAs \nwere part of a “ paperwork shuffle ”. \n(a) RSA Pledges and LFSA Pledges \n280 D1 and D2 have not addressed the Bank’s case that these documents were shams.

For example, on 28.4.15, \nShvetsova emailed Melnyk as follows {E9/53}, {E9/54P}:144 \n“Good afternoon Sergey Vladimirovich,  \nAt the moment, we are undergoing a very difficult check by the National Bank of \nUkraine. There was a request for the provision of documents on the pledge of Mantas \nLLC, which changed its affiliation and switched from a ferrotrader to PET using \nbackdating. Accordingly, the object of the pledge also changes.  \nA new contract is needed for the supply of PET, with the old numbers and for a certain \namount, which has already been shown in the existing pledge. All data on the new \ncontract are given in the attachment.  \nGiven the very tight deadlines for submitting documents to the National Bank of \nUkraine, please assist in the preparation of a new contract.” \n(2) The following timeline is typical of the backdating of supply agreements:145  \nDate Email Reference \n17.6.15 Shvetsova (BOK) to Melnyk (PBC) with the subject ‘Collateral’:  \n“In June, the contracts with the companies GARDERA LLC and \nNAUTIS-TRADE LLC ... expire , but due to the need for them \ntechnical contracts with “TRADE POINT AGRO LIMITED” \nwere concluded. We have prepared draft new contracts. Please do \nassist in obtaining the signature from the counterparty. In May you \nhelped with one client, in June 2 are left.

Shvetsova explained that \nthe prepayments under most of the contracts had been refunded and “ the rest of \nthe contracts are purely ‘technical’ in nature ” and needed to be replaced. Tellingly, \nalthough Shvetsova’s email was sent to Gurieva, it was addressed to Novikov \n(presumably so that Gurieva could forward it to Novikov to arrange for D1-2 \ncompanies to execute the documents): see {E2/117}, {E2/118P}.146 \n(b) Shvetsova’s email to Melnyk dated 26.11.15 begins “ thank you for the Skorzonera \ncontracts ” before requesting further supply agreements {E12/52.1}. Skorzonera \nis a D1-2 admitted asset (see D1: {J2/5/2}, D2: {L/2.07}), which was evidently \nbeing managed by Melnyk. \n(c) Strikingly, when Shvetsova had a problem with the collateral for “ ferrotraders ” \nloans, she contacted Melnikova to “ consider the possibility of drawing up ‘technical’ \ncontracts ” {E2/123}. Furthermore, as set out below, Melnikova was the contact \npoint for purported pledges granted by NZP and OGOK (D1-2 admitted \nassets).147 In circumstances in which Melnikova regularly sought D1-2’s consent \nfor payments to/from the Ferroalloy Companies, it is to be inferred she also \nobtained their consent for these (sham) pledges. \n(b) Share Pledges  \n281 Valuation. There is no longer any dispute that the shares purportedly pledged pursuant to \nthe Share Pledges were worth only a fraction of their stated value. The Bank’s unchallenged \nexpert evidence is that the shares were overvalued by 89-96% (see total % difference at the \n \n146  On 15.4.13 Shvetsova sent a similar email to Gurieva, addressed to Novikov, which asked him “ please instruct \nthe relevant executors to prepare Securities Sale and Purchase Agreements for execution of collateral as property rights to shares ” \nfor borrowers identified as ‘Nitrogen Traders’, ‘Ferrotraders’, ‘AVIA Traders’, ‘PET Traders’, ‘Ore Project’, \n‘Rubber Project’, ‘Kremenchug Steel Casting Works’ and ‘IMRP Project’: {E1/310}. \n147  In their asset disclosure, OGOK is called PJSC Pokrovskiy Mining Processing Plant.

D1-2 have been at pains to distance themselves from the \ndocuments purporting to grant the individual Share Pledges.152 The Court should reject the \nsuggestion that D1-2 did not approve the generation of documents purporting to record the \ngranting of the Share Pledges as part of the scheme to make the Relevant Loans appear \n \n148  D1’s assertion that he “ stands by  [his] defence ” {Day18/193:7} is preposterous: his pleaded case that the Relevant \nLoans were fully secured is not supported by evidence and plainly untenable. It is plain that D1 chose not to \nformally abandon that part of his pleaded case mid-trial simply because to do so would have resulted in a large \ncosts order against him.  \n149   For example, the Goiania Share Pledge goes from UAH 1.196bn (27.3.14) {F134/3/5} to UAH 380m \n(30.6.14) {F134/5/3} to UAH 2.3bn (29.12.14) {F134/7/5}. \n150  For example, two credit committee presentations dated 12.1.16 give a value for Goiania of UAH 7,348m and \nUAH9.295m {K2-G/3/6} {K2-G/4/6}, and a presentation on 14.1.16 gives a value of UAH14,267m {K2-\nG/5/6}.  \n151  For example, the valuation of Goiania on 29.12.14 of UAH 9.4bn {F134/7/5} vastly overstates the value of \nGoiania’s planes, proceeds on the basis that Goiania has 38 (and not 30) planes, and entirely ignores Goiania’s \ndebt. Goiania’s actual accounts for the same date say that its liabilities exceed its assets by US$38m {K2-\nI/12.1/4} (penultimate paragraph: “ As of 31 December 2014, the liabilities of the Company exceed the value of its assets \nby USD 38,288,469 ”).  \n152  D1Def/¶20(3)(d) {A1/8/15}; D2 RRFI (Response to Request 2(a)) {A2/39.2/2-3}; D2Def/¶30(4) \n{A1/18/14}; D2 Opening/¶160(6) {AA4/1/66}. \nAA2/15/159\n153 genuine (and hence provide cover for the extraction of the Bank’s money by the Relevant \nDrawdowns): \n(1) D1-2 accept that they owned and/or controlled the majority of the pledgors and \npledged companies: D1Def/Sch. 6 {A1/17}.153 For example:154 \n(a) The shares in Goiania were owned 50/50 by D1 and D2 via Troyon Assets and \nFeyen Consulting: 50% of the shares in Troyon and Feyen were held by \nTsitsekkos and Eftychia Xenofontos for D1 {J1/3/10-11} and the remaining \n50% were held on bare trust by Krimson Management for Sim Lim (D2’s trust \ncompany, run by Marangos): {J3/4/20}.  \n(b) The pledges of Goiania’s shares were signed by Tsitsekkos (for Troyon) and \nXenofontos (for Feyen): {F133/1/15} {F134/1/15}. It is inherently incredible \nto suppose that these two Cypriot nominees would have purported to pledge \nD1-2’s shares in Goiania as security without D1-2’s approval.  \n(2) The Share Pledges are referred to on the face of the Bank’s financial statements as \npledges over “ corporate rights for shares ” (see 2014 {K1/4/41} and 2015 {K1/5/41}). \nThe Court should infer that D1-2 knew what security was being referred to in these \npassages, that the security was a sham, and that D2’s pleaded case that “ he was not aware \nthat the security took the form of share pledges ” (D2 RRFI/¶2(a)(ii) {A2/39.2/3}) is a lie.  \n(3) D1-2’s"}

As to that: ( i) there is no evidence of these \npurported agreements; and ( ii) it is inherently incredible to suppose D1-2 agreed to \npledge their assets as security for lending to unconnected borrowers on an open-ended \nbasis – no rational commercial businessmen would offer such collateral to wholly \nunknown entities. The only credible explanation is that the D1-2 knew that the scheme \nto extract money from the Bank for their benefit required some ostensibly credible \n \n153  For D2’s position adopting D1’s pleading see: Enyo (22.6.22, 2nd) {L/76.1}, Hogan Lovells (6.7.22) {L/82} \nand Enyo (2.8.22, 2nd) {L/85}. \n154  See too:  \n Shillingston / Derling . Shillingston was owned 50-50 by D1-2 (D2’s interest via Sim Lim): see D1 asset \n78 {J2/3/105}, {J2/4/4}, D2 asset 164{J4/5/160}. The pledge of shares in Shillingston was signed on \nbehalf of Derling (the pledgor) by Katia Parpi (a Sofocleous employee who appears in D2’s 2008 Asset \nList (cell Q18: {E18/173P/10})). \n SC Feral / Feral : owned 50% D1 via Kyriakos Theodorou {J1/3/2}, 50% D2 via Sim Lim {J3/4/17}. \nThe Share Pledge at {F143/1/18} is signed by Kyriakos Theodorou. Theodorou is director of Feral \nLimited and he holds 50% of the shares on trust for D1. It is not realistic to suppose he signed a pledge \nof Feral’s shares in SC Feral without D1’s approval.  \nAA2/15/160\n154 security, and so agreed that their assets could be used to create sham security for sham \nlending to their own shell companies. \n(4) That the Share Pledges were never enforced – and were released shortly before \nnationalisation (as set out below) – is a striking indication that they were never \nintended by D1-2 or the Bank to create enforceable obligations. For example, Uniks’ \nRelevant Loan 4Yu14262D was overdue from July 2015 (see {E13/86}, {E13/87}) \nand was secured by pledges of shares in Kyivguma {F1/103}. Yet the pledges which \nsecured the Uniks loan were not enforced. \n283 The Court should also reject the notion that D1-2 are not the owners and controllers of all \nthe Share Pledgors and the companies whose shares were pledged. By way of summary (and \nas explained at {Day16/132:12} - {Day16/137:21}: \n(1) The Share Pledges were all created, executed and backdated in the same way. The table \nshowing backdating handed up on Day 16 includes entries for an Erlan pledge (a \ncompany where ownership/control is denied): see {A1/17/2} and {AA6/14/6}. \n(2) Of the 16 Share Pledgors where ownership/control is denied, seven are Lafferty \nSpreadsheets Companies: Albroath, Ballioti, Celastrina (also a Borrower), Densitron \n(again, a Borrower), Everrin, Kreontas and Sofet. Of the five companies whose shares \nwere pledged where ownership/control is denied, two are Lafferty Spreadsheets \nCompanies: Clendon and Dinacom. \n(3) There is specific evidence linking D1-2 to the denied companies. For example, D1 \nadmitted ownership and control of Celastrina in the Pinchuk Proceedings \n{E5/157.2/21}. See too Clendon and Erlan below. \n284 Release of the Share Pledges.

That is inconsistent with the documents and is \nunsustainable in light of Shekmar’s unchallenged evidence on the point:  \n(1) The Share Pledges were all released by mid-November 2016. The process was \norchestrated by Primecap – see for example the emails by which Primecap sent \nMarangos the draft termination agreement for the Feral Share Pledge on 8.11.16 \n(which Marangos returned the next day).155  \n \n155  {E16/111.01} (email exchange between Primecap and Marangos) and {E16/111.02} (attached termination \nagreement signed by Feral). The termination agreement signed by both Feral and the Bank is at {F143/10}.  \nAA2/15/161\n155 (2) The NBU had nothing to do with that process, as Shekmar explained: “ I never gave any \ninstructions to the Bank to the effect that the loans to the 193 Borrowers should be repaid, or the \nsecurity should be released, and nor was I (or am I) aware of anyone else from my team (or, indeed, \nthe NBU more generally) having done so ” (Shekmar/¶61 {B1/12/19}). \n(3) EY were told in November 2016 that share pledges were being prepared as security \nfor the New Loans and was provided with draft share pledges but none had been \nsigned (like those at {E16/36.1} {E16/36.2} {E16/36.3} {E16/36.4}). EY reported: \n“The bank claims that signing of contracts was delayed due to technical reasons (delay in transporting \ndocuments) ” {E16/179/116}. That was a lie. Had D1-2 wanted to put in place share \npledges for the New Loans, they could have done so in a matter of days. \n(c) Further security  \n285 D1-2’s close role in providing their assets as security for the Relevant Loans is demonstrated \nby the security granted for seven Borrowers’ loans by NFP and OGOK in August 2014: see \nPOC/¶¶19(a.1), (a.2) {A1/2/11}. The timeline is as follows: \n(1) On 11.8.14, Shvetsova emailed Gurieva to propose that further security be granted \nfor loans outstanding from seven Borrowers (Agroprom, Esmola, Favore, Imris, \nIndustrial Garant, Mastein and Prado) {E4/261}. Shvetsova proposed that the \nsecurity should consist of pledges by NFP and ZFP of “ stock-in-trade and property \n(equipment) ” as well as “ receivables under current contracts of [NFP ] entered into with Chemstar \nProducts ”. Shvetsova asked Gurieva to “ please assist in the registration of all previously \nunregistered property… ”. \n(2) On 28.8.14, Shvetsova emailed a colleague panicking about the wording of a letter to \nNFP, and the end-of-the-month deadline: “ If this [wording ] is suitable, then we will fill in \nthe enterprises part and send it to S.V. Melnik for signature ” {E4/337.1}. \n(3) The pledge agreements – by which NFP and OGOK pledged their assets as security \nfor the Borrowers’ loans – were all dated “ August 2014 ”.156 The pledged assets included \nore, coke, manganese concentrate, equipment and rights under a supply agreement \nwith Chemstar.  \n(4) On 12.9.14, Shvetsova emailed Melnikova to say: “ we previously got in touch asking for \nassistance in the provision of the property and inventory balances of [NFP ], MGOK, [OGOK ], \n \n156  NFP pledges: {E2/257.1T}, {E2/257.2T}, {E2/257.3T}, {E2/257.4T} {E2/257.6T}, {E2/257.7T}, \n{E2/257.8T}, [E2/257.9T}, {E2/257.10T}, {E2/257.11T}, {E2/257.12T}; OGOK pledge: {E2/257.5T}.  \nAA2/15/162\n156 [ZFP] for assets held by  [the seven Borrowers ].

The Court should \ninfer that D1-2 approved the grant of this (sham) security, and that approval was co-\nordinated by Melnikova, Gurieva and Melnyk. \n(5) The 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings158 \n286 The Bank’s case that the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings were a collusive exercise between the \nBank, the Borrowers and D3-8 is supported by the documents and has not been challenged. \nD3-8 Opening/¶39 {AA5/1/21} recites the Bank’s case that the “ correspondence and addenda \nleading up to the judgment in each case were contrived / shams ” without challenging the same, while \nD2 appears to accept that the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings were “ the next step ” in the \nfraudulent scheme: D2 Opening/¶68 {AA4/1/30}.  \n287 The 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings provide powerful evidence that the Bank, the Borrowers \nand D3-8 were under common control. The documents show that the 2014 Ukrainian \nProceedings were pursued collusively by PBC, Primecap and BOK. It is inherently incredible \nthat the underlings at PBC, Primecap and BOK directed those proceedings on a frolic of \ntheir own. The Court should find that the Bank, the Borrowers and D3-8 were under the \ncommon control of D1-2, who procured the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings as a way to bring \nto an end the active phase of the Misappropriation.  \nF2 D2’ S POSITION : A “WIDER ” FRAUD AND AN “ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION ” \n288 D2’s pleaded case and his (abandoned) witness evidence contain no positive case that there \nwas a “ wider scheme ” on-going at the Bank than that alleged by the Bank. To the contrary, \nthose maintained denials (albeit bare) that there was any fraudulent scheme. \n \n157  See the releases at {E4/341.2} - {E4/341.13}.  \n158  See Bank Opening/F5/¶¶263-272 {AA2/1/113-116}. \nAA2/15/163\n157 289 However, the position changed dramatically in D2’s Opening Submissions, which advanced \nfor the first time a positive case that there was a “ wider” exercise consisting of a “ pattern of \nlending ” which constituted (improper) loan recycling: D2 Opening/¶¶15-16 {AA4/1/9}. D2 \nseeks to set this alleged wider loan recycling fraud up as an ‘alternative explanation’, albeit \none that is unpleaded and entirely unevidenced.  \n290 These new positions do not provide an alternative explanation at all, certainly not an \nexculpatory one. The short points are that: \n(1) If and to the extent that there was earlier fraudulent conduct which followed a similar \npattern, then that would serve only to provide yet further confirmation as to the \nfraudulent nature of the Misappropriation. It is really just a factual concession that \nthere was indeed this type of fraudulent conduct at the Bank, made inevitable by the \ndocumentary evidence. It does not somehow provide a defence; and \n(2) The fact that the 90-day prepayment / repayment cycle reflects currency control \nrestrictions does not mean that there is an innocent explanation for the payment \npatterns: the real question is why this was being done. And the only plausible answer \nis: as a means of avoiding detection whilst laundering the misappropriated money. \n291 To develop these points in a little more detail: \n(1) The Bank does not dispute that there was "}

And the only plausible answer \nis: as a means of avoiding detection whilst laundering the misappropriated money. \n291 To develop these points in a little more detail: \n(1) The Bank does not dispute that there was or may have been other improper loan \nrecycling at the Bank prior to April 2013, although its extent and nature is not in \nevidence, as it has never been an issue in this case.  \n(2) Nor does the Bank dispute that the pattern of c. 90-day prepayment / repayment \ncycling which forms part of the Misappropriation was driven in part by the regulatory \nlandscape in which the Bank operated, including NBU imposed currency controls ( cp. \nD2 Opening/B3/¶¶52 ff {AA4/1/23-31}).  \n(3) But neither point is in any way inconsistent with the Bank’s case as to the \nMisappropriation; indeed the latter has been part of the Bank’s case throughout. The \nexistence of the practice within BOK of ‘loan recycling’ and the use sham supply \nagreements and prepayment / repayment cycles to evade currency controls (and hence \ndetection) is wholly consistent with the Bank’s case.  \n(4) D2’s assertion that September 2014 did not mark the end of the ‘Scheme’ but “ the \nmethod for recording circular payments was changed ” (D2 Opening/¶69 {AA4/1/31}) adds \nnothing. It is not clear what D2 means. There is no evidence that the 90-day cycles of \nAA2/15/164\n158 prepayments and returns of prepayments to foreign companies continued or was \nreplaced after September 2014 and the proposition that “ there was simply a change in the \nmethod by which money is circulated ” {Day7/50:1-6} is not borne out by the evidence. It is \nnot disputed that the Unreturned Prepayments were not returned.  \n292 For these reasons, D2’s eleventh hour “ alternative explanation ” is not an “ alternative ” to the \nBank’s case at all; it is a substantial acceptance of it.  \n293 In addition to the supposed ‘alternative explanation’, D2 seeks to suggest that the Gurieva \nSpreadsheet, Kazantsev Spreadsheet and other spreadsheets recording the supply \nagreements are “ artefactual, recording the legend that the Bank was seeking to promote rather than the \nreal transactions and their true purpose ”: D2 Opening/¶64 {AA4/1/29}. As to that: \n(1) The supply agreement documents served a purpose, even if the supply agreements \nwere shams. They provided cover for the 90-day cycles of prepayments and returns.  \n(2) As D2 accepts, the creation of the sham supply agreements was necessary to comply \nwith real world currency control restrictions: ( i) when the Borrower applied to convert \nUAH into US$, it made express reference to the supply agreements which justified the \nconversion (see the currency conversion applications in bundle {K7-C/1}); ( ii) where \nthe Bank failed to ensure prepayments were recorded as returned within 90 days the \nBorrower was fined (see Bank Opening/fn. 178 {AA2/1/101}); ( iii) where US dollar \nprepayments were returned, they often had to be converted into UAH and back to US \ndollars (another currency control requirement), triggering the payment of a \ncompulsory national pension insurance fee; ( iv) payment of those fees and the \napplication of different FX rates necessitated additional drawdowns, known as ‘FX \nTop-ups’ {Day23/28:22} - {Day23/29:5}, and ( v) following the Unreturned \nPrepayments, D1-2 procured the 2014 Ukrainian Judgments to avoid the penal \nconsequences of those currency control restrictions. \n(3) The Bank’s case is that the true purpose of all this was misappropriation and money \nlaundering.

In contrast, D2 does not identify what he says the “ true purpose ” of the \ntransactions was. He says it was to evade currency control regulations, but he does not \nanswer the next question: why? There can be no innocent explanation for the Bank’s \ninvolvement in the elaborate choreography necessary to continuously move US dollars \nin 90-day cycles from Ukraine to Cyprus and back pursuant to vast swathes of sham \ndocumentation. The Court should conclude that the “ true purpose ” of these transactions \nAA2/15/165\n159 was the fraudulent extraction of US dollars from the Bank in Ukraine for the benefit \nof D1-2.  \n(4) The Gurieva Spreadsheet {E18/213P}, Kazantsev Spreadsheet {E7/39P} and other \nsimilar spreadsheets ( e.g. {E7/57P}) were internal bank documents held by those who \norchestrated the fraud. The very existence of these documents – and the care with \nwhich the Kazantsev Spreadsheet was maintained – demonstrates that the Bank, the \nBorrowers and D3-8 were part of a coordinated scheme which involved 90-day cycles \nculminating in the Unreturned Prepayments. The supply agreements were indeed \nshams (or, in D2’s language, a “ legend that the Bank was seeking to promote ”: D2 \nOpening/¶64 {AA4/1/29}). The transaction pattern which those (sham) documents \nenabled, however, was real.  \n(5) D1-2’s attempts to advance alternative explanations for what the Gurieva and \nKazantsev Spreadsheets show should be treated with scepticism: both Gurieva and \nKazantsev could have been tendered as witnesses (indeed, Kazantsev gave evidence \nfor D1 – relied upon by D2 – in 2018); had D1-2 considered they would support their \nalternative theories, they presumably would have called them.  \n294 It seems that the real purpose of D2’s submission is to give some kind of factual grounding \nto his reliance on the Use of Funds Defence: in essence, he advances the argument that even \nif D1 and D2 did steal money from the Bank through the Misappropriation, there is no loss, \nbecause they used the proceeds to “ repay” money they had stolen in earlier years. That \nuntenable and thoroughly discredited defence is addressed in Section M  below.  \nF3 BENEFIT  \n295 It is the Bank’s case that D1-2 were the ultimate beneficiaries of the Misappropriation: \nPOC/¶5 {A1/2/2}. D2 asserted in opening that “[ w]e’ve not heard a word about benefit ” \n{Day7/77:6-8}. D1 took a rather different line, and put it to Ms Rozhkova in cross-\nexamination that “ it would not be difficult to conclude that this appeared to be … an arrangement whereby \nfunds were being withdrawn for the benefit of Mr Kolomoisky ” {Day8/58:4-8} and  “it’s obvious that the \nBank, PrivatBank, would have claims against its shareholders for having transited the Bank’s money to \ntheir companies ” {Day8/96:2-5} (emphasis added) \n296 While it is not a necessary part of the Bank’s claim under Art. 1166 to show that the Relevant \nDrawdowns ended up in D1-2’s accounts or companies (on a proprietary basis or at all), it \nis quite clear from the documents that the Misappropriation was for their ultimate benefit. \n{AA2/15/358}\nAA2/15/166\n160 297 This is relevant because: ( i) it gives the lie to D2’s case that he had no involvement in the \nMisappropriation and that the ‘Scheme’ was masterminded by Dubilet on a frolic of his own; \n(ii) it shows that the Borrowers were mere conduits for money flowing for the ultimate \nbenefit of D1-2 and their companies/projects – the inexorable conclusion is that the \nBorrowers were owned and/or controlled by D1-2; and ( iii)  it demonstrates that the relevant \nloans and supply agreements were shams – a device to extract US dollars from the Bank. \n(1) Benefit: fund flows \n298 "}

Mr Thompson showed that \nthree of the Relevant Drawdowns Mr Davidson failed to trace could be traced, using \nMr Davidson’s methodology, to loan repayments to ZFP, a substantial company and part of \nthe Ferroalloy Holding in which D1-2 both held interests {J2/3/11}, {J4/5/145} \n(Thompson2/¶¶5.83-5.87 {D1/347/59-63}) while the UAH 157m drawdown by \nProminmet could be traced on a ‘Funds Flow’ basis to D1-2 (see the diagram at \nThompson2/¶5.89 {D1/347/66}). In particular:  \n(1) US$653k of the Prominmet drawdown could be traced to a payment by Grizal to D2’s \npersonal account under the D2-Grizal counter-financing agreement {L/154.1.2}. \n(2) US$16.6m of the Prominmet drawdown could be traced to a payment by High Wings \nAviation to an account of De Gama GmbH at Deutsche Bank to purchase a \nBombardier aircraft under an ‘Aircraft Sale and Purchase Agreement’ dated 3.4.14 (see \n{E3/97.1}). The plane is described in D1’s asset disclosure as a Challenger 604 owned \nby High Wings and “ held for the benefit of [D1] on the basis of an oral agreement between Sergiy \nMelnyk [sic] and [D1]” {J1/3/12}. \n299 Despite not commenting on this analysis in his reports, Mr Davidson confirmed during \ncross examination that he was content it was correct: {Day25/86:19} - {Day25/87:20}.  \n300 D1-2 have not offered any explanation for their receipt of these funds. In relation to the \nremainder of the US$557m, which Mr Davidson agreed during cross-examination was paid \n“into accounts where there is such a degree of mixing that any form of exact matching becomes impossible ” \n{Day25/87:24} - {Day25/88:1}, Mr Davidson has not set out in his reports any ‘Use of \nFunds’ analysis. He accepted in cross-examination, however, that taking just one example, \nthe transactional data shows that a US$30m Relevant Drawdown by the Borrower Tekhspets \non 26.6.2014 can be followed to Divot (a company owned by D1 {L/5.2.1.1/2}) which then \nAA2/15/167\n161 made payments totalling US$195 million to Grizal (D2’s treasury company) between \n27.7.2013 and 6.10.2016. As Mr Davidson readily accepted when it was put to him in cross \nexamination: “ although we can’t engage in Exact Matching, what we can say is that proceeds from the \nRelevant Drawdowns went to a company which itself was funding one of the Second Defendant’s companies ” \n{Day25/88:10} - {Day25/89:5}.  \n(2) Benefit: contemporaneous BOK documents \n301 A number of documents show that BOK employees understood that funds were advanced \nunder Relevant Loans for the ultimate benefit of D1-2’s companies. For example:  \n(1) On 10.12.13, Plyska emailed Gubanova and Melnyk as follows {E2/223/3}: \n“We suggest the following distribution of companies and limits for them:  \na.

US$15m) in Relevant \nDrawdowns under Relevant Loan 4I14070I and made a prepayment in that US \ndollar amount to Faberge {D1/86}. \n(6) On 8.4.15, Vetluzhskikh emailed Yatsenko with a copy of a letter from PwC. PwC \nnoted that the Bank was “ involved in a project to fund the construction of a hotel in Croatia ” \n(i.e. Hotel Split) and that “ in 2014 the borrower raised financing by structuring the transaction \nusing intermediary companies (Ortika LLC, Ribotto LLC and Prudis LLC) ”. PwC said those \nborrowers should be added to the IFRS related parties list: {E8/181.1} {E8/181.2}. \n(7) An internal Bank presentation dated 30.6.15, entitled “ Credit to Radisson Blu Resort \nSplit”, addresses the “ financing ” of Hotel Split, including the construction of a new wing \ncalled the Cane Bay Residence. It identifies the “ Borrowers ” as Ortika, Ribotto and \nPrudis and their outstanding loan balances {E10/157.06/2}.159  \n302 Further emails and documents confirm that loans were advanced to fund D1-2 “ projects ”:  \n \n159  The loan balances identified in this spreadsheet match the UAH balances identified as outstanding in other \nBank documents dated 30.6.15: see e.g. {E10/157.04P} (Ortika) and {E10/157.03P} (Ribotto). \nAA2/15/169\n163 (1) On 18.1.10, Gurieva received an email “ Prepared by … Rzhevskyy ” with a “ refinancing \nscheme ” for loans advanced for the “ Land M project ” {E1/47} (the same land project in \nwhich D1-2’s Dorteks and Uniks were involved: see above.  \n(2) Rzhevskyy explained “ to finance borrowing companies, please increase credit line limit for \nAgroaviadnepr LLC…to UAH  70[m]”.

For example:  \n(1) The Kazantsev Spreadsheet {E7/39P} allocates the 46 Ukrainian Borrowers to \ncategories which are associated with D1-2 assets or projects: \nCategory in \nKazantsev \nSpreadsheet D1-2 associated asset/project \nTankers D1 has disclosed that he is the 100% owner of Dinacom  {J1/3/4} which \nowned the ‘Mount Olympus’ tanker  (see Bezant-Pledges1/¶A24.10 \n{D8/27/3}). It is likely he also owned the ‘Mount McKinney’  (which was \npart of the same financing transaction as Dinacom in 2016: see {E12/148}, \n{E12/149}). \nD2’s 2007 asset list includes the sub-heading “ Fleet” {E1/11P/8}. \nSkorzonery  \n[sc.

However: \n Clendon purchased the Retal Group with €320m in funds from the Bank, \nextracted via sham loans, and orchestrated by Novikov’s Investment \nDepartment: see {E1/15}, {E1/10}, {E1/13}. \n D2 has disclosed draft documents prepared by Anischenko for a transfer \nby Martynov of 50% of the shares in Clendon from Marigold to Sim Lim \nin 2016 for consideration of $1 (as part of the redomiciliation of D2’s trusts \nfrom Jersey to Cyprus): {E7/178.1L}, {E18/240L}, {E18/241L}. \n Clendon is a Share Pledgor and a Lafferty Spreadsheets Company (see \n{A6/63/6}) (although it thereafter ignored Fieldfisher’s requests for \ndisclosure: {L/92.05/25}).  \nNitrogen trader  DniproAzot  is a chemical producer, in which D1-2 have a combined c. 30% \ninterest {J2/3/94}, {J4/5/139}.

On 10.11.14, at around the \nsame time as the Gurieva Spreadsheet was produced, Plyska (BOK) produced a memo \nexplaining the interest due on loans to borrowers in projects which are readily \nidentifiable as D1-2 projects ( e.g. “IMRP Project ”, “Skorzonera Equipment ”, “Ukrainian \nPlant of Extra Large Tyres ”, “Ferro”, etc.): {E7/12.1}. \n(3) On 26.1.15, Leschenko emailed Kazantsev and others to explain that “[ d]ue to the \nplanned closure of several borrowers…the bank may have problems with reservations for these loans \n{AA2/15/174}\nAA2/15/171\n165 and projects ”. He explained the Borrowers had “ significant indebtedness in foreign currencies ” \nand that {E7/266}:  \n“During 2015, all currency loans of ~$1.8 billion, issued to ‘traders’ across all \nprogrammes (ferrotraders, tanker project, rubber project, PET traders, IMRP traders, \naircraft traders, Kievguma traders, Split traders, Bukovel traders, traders) will go into \narrears. Therefore, the auditors may recognise the debts in these industries (amounting \nto ~49 billion UAH) as non-performing and subsequently irrecoverable and increase \nthe provision for these sectors. \nIt is now impossible to refinance foreign currency loans (as before), due to restrictions \nof the National Bank in the sale of currency on the market and tight control of new \nlarge disbursements…”  \nThe US$1.8bn outstanding is clearly a reference to the loans to the Borrowers (also \nidentified as outstanding in the Gurieva Spreadsheet). It is striking that Leschenko \nascribed the Borrowers’ US$1.8bn indebtedness to identifiable D1-2 assets \n(Kyivguma, Hotel Split, Bukovel, IMRP) and industries (ferroalloys, aircraft, etc.). \n(3) Benefit: the Bank’s financial statements \n304 The Bank’s financial statements also show that the vast majority of its lending went to \nsectors in which D1-2 had large corporate interests. That admits of only two possibilities: ( i) \nthey were lending to their own companies, or ( ii) they used their bank to fund their rivals’ \nbusinesses. The latter is absurd. The former is borne out by the documents set out above, \nand Ms Lozytzka’s unchallenged evidence that BOK’s “ strategic clients ” were “ companies and \nplants which fell within industry sectors in which [D1-2 ] held business interests ” {B1/6/5} (¶14). \n305 The Bank’s 2014 financial statements show that the Bank had “ loans and advances to customers ” \nof UAH 161bn {K1/4/5}.

D1 disclosed that he \nwas personally owed debts by three football clubs: FC Dnipro  \n(Asset 106); FC Arsenal  (Asset 107); and FC Kryvbas  (Asset \n108) {J2/3/120}.  \n306 It is clear, therefore, that the Bank’s senior management and D1-2 as the Supervisory Board \nand majority shareholders viewed the Bank as a mechanism for providing funding to their \nindustrial interests. The corporate loan book was ultimately a set of loans to D1-2’s \nbusinesses in these industrial sectors or to shell companies which acted as conduits for \nfunding to these enterprises. Even though most of the lending was to the shell companies \nrather than to the trading enterprises, D1-2 and their lieutenants at the Bank were able to \nclassify the lending for the purposes of the financial statements as lending to these specific \nsectors in which D1-2 had interests.  \n307 There was a striking discrepancy between the scale of the lending to sectors in which D1-2 \nhad major holdings and the disclosed related party lending (only UAH 18bn, or about 11%,  \nof the UAH 161bn in corporate loans recorded in the 2014 financial statements: \n{K1/4/96}). PwC belatedly picked up on this point in their memo (circulated by Yatsenko \nto Novikov, Gurieva and Dubilet on 21.6.16) in which they drew attention to ( i) the use of \n“traders ” in particular sectors to act as borrowers for funding to D1-2 entities; and ( ii) the \nfailure to identify those “ traders ” beneficial owners or classify them as related parties: \n{E14/224.1}, {E14/224.2}, {E14/224.2M}.  \n308 D1-2’s business model was to procure loans from the Bank to a façade of shell companies, \nand that money found its way to fund D1 and D2’s businesses. These shell companies – the \n“traders ” – were not declared as related parties (like the “ ferro traders ”) so as to limit the Bank’s \ndeclared related party lending. The borrowers enabled D1-2 to silo the debt associated with \n{AA2/15/98}\nAA2/15/173\n167 their industrial assets in shell companies with no value, so the debt did not appear to infect \nD1 and D2’s underlying businesses.

Nevertheless, it is clear that D1-2 were the ultimate intended \nbeneficiaries of the Bank’s lending. \n(4) Benefit: the Lafferty Spreadsheets \n309 The wider relevance of the Lafferty Spreadsheets is addressed immediately below. For \npresent purposes, the relevance of the Lafferty Spreadsheets is that they show that, according \nto the individuals at BOK with knowledge of the Misappropriation, at least US$452m of \nRelevant Drawdowns went via “ break points ” to repay loans of companies in which D1-2 \nhave admitted interests:160 see the explanation at {AA6/18} and {Day13/58:6-18}.  \n310 The Lafferty Spreadsheets and Mr Davidson’s Payment Chains also depict chains of \npayments being made and received by ( inter alia ) 55 companies that feature in D1-2’s WFO \nasset disclosure: {Day13/84:19} - {Day13/85:2} and Appendix F1 . These are not “ empty \nvessels ”, but valuable assets and holding companies, which D1-2 have disclosed pursuant to \nthe freezing order. Why (we ask rhetorically) would D1-2 have directed their valuable \ncompanies to make and receive payments that form part of payment chains which display \n“indicators of Trade-Based Money Laundering ” (Thompson1/¶2.2(g) {D1/1/25}) or “ a money \ncirculation scheme ” (Steadman XX {Day26/13:9-10}) if they were not benefitting from that \nscheme.  \nF4 THE LAFFERTY SPREADSHEETS  \n311 The Bank has already addressed the Lafferty Spreadsheets in detail at Bank Opening/M4(1)/ \n¶¶557-560 {AA2/1/218-219} and {Day13/26:} - {Day13/98:10}. At this stage, we draw \nattention to the following features of the Lafferty Spreadsheets and the exercise by which \nthey were produced: \n312 Sources of information: \n(1) The Lafferty Spreadsheets were produced in support of D1’s jurisdiction challenge on \n9.3.18. Lafferty2/¶17 {H2/8/5} explained that “[ D1] personally and a team put together by \n[him] have been working hard to establish where the money which is alleged by the Bank to have been \n \n160  US$14.8m of which were repayments of loans owed to banks other than the Bank: see {AA6/18/3} (¶10). \n{AA2/20}\nAA2/15/174\n168 misappropriated went ”. The “ team” consisted of individuals “ aware of the transaction patterns \ndescribed below and the companies involved in the Scheme ”: Lafferty2/¶20. After c. 2 years of \nD1 refusing to identify the “ team”, D1 was ordered to identify the personnel in \nLafferty18/¶9 {H2/52/3}: it consisted of six BOK employees (Gurieva, Gubanova, \nMyakenkyi, Kurasova, Taranenko, Demidchenko) and two Primecap employees \n(Gninenko, Dneinega). \n(2) The Lafferty Spreadsheets were produced on the basis of “ the Bank’s transactional data ” \nprovided by “ former employees and clients of the Bank ”: Lafferty2/¶18 {H2/8/5}. When \nthe Bank pointed out that the provision of this data was likely to constitute a criminal \noffence under Ukrainian law (Lewis3/¶47 {H1/17/13}), D1 performed an abrupt \nvolte face  and asserted instead that the Lafferty Spreadsheets had been produced using \nthe relevant companies’ bank statements: Lafferty3/¶53(c) {H2/11/15}. \n(3) Lafferty3 was filed on 11.6.18. On 19.6.18, the Bank requested copies of the bank \nstatements under CPR 31.14. On 26.6.18, 200,000 pages of loose, unindexed and \nunordered bank statements of 214 companies (the “Lafferty Spreadsheets \nCompanies” ) were provided to Hogan Lovells (see Wales10/¶33(c) {H"}

On 19.6.18, the Bank requested copies of the bank \nstatements under CPR 31.14. On 26.6.18, 200,000 pages of loose, unindexed and \nunordered bank statements of 214 companies (the “Lafferty Spreadsheets \nCompanies” ) were provided to Hogan Lovells (see Wales10/¶33(c) {H1/50/18} and \nthe photo at {H1/50.1/1}161). When D1 was ordered to disclose other documents \nused to compile the Lafferty Spreadsheets {A6/63/2}, he produced a nil return.  \n(4) The Court should make the following findings:  \n(a) D1 was personally involved in the exercise of producing the Lafferty \nSpreadsheets because he had personal knowledge of the Relevant Drawdowns. \nHe was able to procure the services of ex-BOK employees at short notice whom \nhe knew had similar knowledge, and who (it is to be inferred) moved to Geneva \nin or about January 2018 (with Gurieva) to assist with the work. \n(b) D1 illegally procured the Bank’s transactional data from former Bank employees \nwhich was used for compiling the spreadsheets. When his criminal conduct was \npointed out, he lied to his solicitors (telling them that the spreadsheets were \nproduced using bank statements) and was then able to procure the production \nof the bank statements from the Lafferty Spreadsheets Companies in short \norder (to give a fig leaf of plausibility to the lie). \n \n161  This shows the statements in the process of being organised by Hogan Lovells; the labels and slipsheets were \nnot provided by D1. \nAA2/15/175\n169 (c) These matters demonstrate D1’s control of the Bank and the Lafferty \nSpreadsheets Companies (which included all of the Borrowers, 14 Intermediary \nBorrowers, D3-8 and c. 54 companies disclosed by D1-2 pursuant to the WFO). \nThere is no other plausible explanation for D1’s ability to procure 214 \ncompanies to produce their confidential bank statements on such short notice \nand, apparently, without any written record of any discussions as to how the \nbank statements would be produced or safeguards which might apply to their \nuse.  \n313 Content of the Lafferty Spreadsheets {H2/8.1/1}, {H2/20.1/2}: \n(1) The Lafferty Spreadsheets consist of 6,000 rows of data setting out details of 926 so-\ncalled “ payment chains ”. These are said to show the “ operation of the Scheme ” \n(Lafferty2/¶25 {H2/8/6}) by which money cycled through “ loops” and was said to \nend up being used to “ discharge outstanding liabilities under loans from the Bank ”. This \nincluded the use of “ break points ” which were positively averred to have the effect that \n“the final money repaid to the Bank appears to originate from somewhere else ”: Lafferty2/¶¶70-\n77 {H2/8/17-18}. This was quintessentially money laundering: Thompson1/¶5.165 \n{D1/1/223}. They have now been abandoned by Ds (despite having stood as part of \ntheir defences for four years); and no commercial explanation has ever been provided \nfor these money movements, despite the Court of Appeal adverting to the absence of \nsuch an explanation in 2019: see Bank Opening/¶¶558-559 {AA2/1/218-219}; \n{A5/12/5} (¶21). \n(2) The Lafferty Spreadsheets (as incorporated into D1’s Defence at ¶58 {A1/8/30} and \nD2’s Defence at ¶67(6)162 {A1/18/32})  advanced a positive case that there was a \n“Scheme ” at the Bank; that individuals in BOK who were members of D1’s “ team” had \nbeen able to identify the “ Scheme ”; and that it included repayments of purported debts \nowed by many of D1-2’s admitted companies. But D1’s case now is that he “ does not \nadvance any positive case of… the existence of any scheme ” (D1 RRFI /¶1 {A2/31.1/3}); and \nthat he did not make the “ material decisions required in relation to those transactions  [in the \nLafferty Spreadsheets ]” (D1Def/¶7(2)(a)(vii) {A1/8/5}). \n(3) The Court should make the following findings:  \n \n162 "}

The “ Scheme ” identified in the spreadsheets is \nfundamentally inconsistent with third parties entering into arm’s length, genuine \ncommercial transactions.  \n(b) The Lafferty Spreadsheets identified a “ Scheme ” which was in operation at the \nBank, but D1-2 have not been willing to attend Court to be cross-examined \nabout its purpose, and have refused to call any of their associates (including the \n“team” who compiled the Lafferty Spreadsheets) who could have done so. The \n“Scheme ” required material decisions to be made – including directing money to \ncirculate in “ loops” through “ break points ” and to and through the bank accounts \nof D1-2’s wholly owned and controlled companies. Given the number of \ncompanies involved and the rapidity of the payments, they must have all been \nunder common control. D1 and D2 are the only individuals who could have \nexercised that control, and either made or authorised the material decisions \nnecessary to move money in the way set out in the spreadsheets.  \n(c) The Lafferty Spreadsheets demonstrate that (on their own (abandoned) case) \nD1-2 benefited from at least US$452m of the Relevant Drawdowns being used \n– via “ break points ” to repay loans owed to the Bank by companies in which they \nhave admitted significant interests: see above. \n314 D2’s position. D2 cannot distance himself from the Lafferty Spreadsheets: \n(1) D2 expressly adopted the content of the Lafferty Spreadsheets in support of his \njurisdiction challenge ({G1/18/2} and Bogolyubov2/¶3 {H3/3/2}: “ I have read the \nsecond witness statement of Andrew Lafferty…I also refer to and rely on that witness statement in \nsupport of my own application ”). As set out above, his pleaded case likewise adopted the \nLafferty Spreadsheets until they were abandoned by amendments in June 2022 \n(D2Def/¶67(6) – purple deletions {A1/18/32}). \n(2) Companies which were wholly owned by D2 were included in the transaction chains \nand promptly provided their bank statements to D1 in June 2018. For example, the \nUS$20.5m Relevant Drawdown by Ribotto on 6.2.14 (prompted by the Kazantsev \nemail set out above: see {E3/10}) was paid to Wolcott and then immediately paid on \nto Olbia Investments (the company which held D2’s 95% interest in Hotel Split via \nthe Croland Trust: see e.g. {E17/148.1.2}) and then to Grandos Enterprises (the \ncompany which provided financing to Hotel Split: see 23.3.17 entry in {AA6/16}). \nAA2/15/177\n171 (3) D2 submitted that “ Mr Bogolyubov has not benefited because no transaction has ever resulted in \nmoney flowing away from the Bank ” {Day7/77:6-10}. But, as set out above, the Lafferty \nSpreadsheets show Relevant Drawdowns being used to repay debts owed by D1-2’s \ncompanies. On any view, that is a benefit to D2 and gives the lie to D2’s suggestion \nthat more junior Bank employees orchestrated the Relevant Drawdowns on a frolic \nof their own. \n• • • \nG OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF THE RELEVANT ENTITIES  \nG1 OVERVIEW  \n315 The Bank’s case on ownership and control of the Relevant Entities is addressed in Bank \nOpening/G/¶¶273-360 {AA2/1/117-149}.

Specifically:  \n(1) D1’s position at trial is that the “ the Bank’s factual case against him is irrelevant ” (D1 \nOpening/¶88 {AA3/1/29}, original emphasis) and he has accordingly largely failed \nto engage on this topic (D1 Opening/¶¶94-102 {AA3/1/31-34}). His limited \ncriticisms of the Bank’s Structure and Nominee Charts are addressed in Section G4(1)  \nbelow. \n(2) D2 contends generally that the Bank has not proven its case: D2 Opening/¶¶151-183 \n{AA4/1/59-80}. In particular, he says that ( i) (with limited exceptions) the surviving \ndocuments (which he did not seek to explain in evidence) do not show he owned \nand/or controlled the Relevant Entities; ( ii) the Structure and Nominee Charts do not \nsupport the inference that D1-2 owned and/or controlled them either; ( iii) there is an \n“alternative explanation ” for the contemporary documents, including the Luchaninov \nEmail and Rokoman Spreadsheets, such that the Bank’s reliance on those documents \nis misplaced; ( iv) there is “ no evidence ” that D2 was aware of or approved the Share \nPledges; and ( v) the Bank’s case on ownership and control is “ circular ”. \n(3) D3-8 reject the inference that, because their purported UBOs are admitted D1-2 \nnominees/associates, they are owned/controlled by D1-2 (D3-8 Opening/¶16 \n{AA5/1/12}). However, they offer no explanation (or evidence) as to how and why \nthese professional nominees came to own D3-8 beneficially. \n{AA2/15/181}\nAA2/15/178\n172 317 We have addressed the surviving documents showing D2’s control of certain of the \nBorrowers at Section F3  and Bank Opening/¶312(3) {AA2/1/131 }, references to which are \ncollated for ease of reference at Appendix G2 , together with other documents that go to \nD1 and D2’s ownership and control of specific Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers; and \nwe have addressed the Share Pledges in Section F . In this section, we address: \n(1) Section G2 : D2’s argument that the Bank’s case on ownership and control is “ circular ” \nbecause it relies upon evidence that D1-2 owned Borrowers as evidence that they also \nowned Intermediary Borrowers and/or D3-8.  \n(2) Section G3 : D1-2’s benefit from the Misappropriation.  \n(3) Section G4 : The Nominee and Structure Charts and Ds’ criticisms of the Bank’s \nreliance on them.  \n(4) Section G5 : D2’s “ alternative explanation ” for the documents relied on by the Bank, in \nparticular the Luchaninov Email and Rokoman Spreadsheets.  \n(5) Section G6 : The evidence of D1-2’s ownership and control of D3-8 relied on by the \nBank which has not been addressed by Ds. \nG2 ALLEGED “CIRCULARITY ” OF THE BANK’S CASE  \n318 D2 says the Bank’s reliance on D1-2’s ownership and control of the Borrowers as a factor \nsupporting its case that D1-2 controlled the Intermediary Borrowers and D3-8 is “ circular ”: \nsee D2 Opening/¶¶136-137 {AA4/1/49-50},  Table 2(1) {AA4/1/62}, Table 3(1) \n{AA4/1/69}, Table 5(4) {AA4/1/74}. \n319 But the point is that the evidence clearly shows that the Borrowers, Intermediary Borrowers \nand D3-8 were under common ownership and control. If this is correct, it follows that \nevidence and submissions that D1-2 owned and/or controlled the Borrowers is also \nevidence that they also owned and/or controlled the Intermediary Borrowers and D3-8. \n320 Turning, then, to why these sets of com"}

If this is correct, it follows that \nevidence and submissions that D1-2 owned and/or controlled the Borrowers is also \nevidence that they also owned and/or controlled the Intermediary Borrowers and D3-8. \n320 Turning, then, to why these sets of companies must have been under common ownership \nand control (to the extent that this is still in dispute at all): \n(1) D2’s submission that the “ circular movement of money ” was designed to avoid currency \ncontrol regulations again requires him to accept that the entities involved in the \nscheme were under common control, as does his submission that the UBOs were \n“fungible ”. On that point, D2 says: “ the evidence shows that it was in fact employees of the Bank, \n{AA2/15/166}\n{AA2/15/149}\n{AA2/15/179}\n{AA2/15/180}\n{AA2/15/180}\n{AA2/15/185}\n{AA2/15/200}\n{AA2/21/11}\nAA2/15/179\n173 Primecap and/or PBC who administered the ‘Scheme’ and/or determined how the Borrowers \nparticipated in the ‘Scheme’ ”: D2 Opening/Table2(8)(b) {AA4/1/67}. \n(2) See, e.g., the email and attachment at {E7/266} {E7/267P}, which deals with the \nreplacement of the 15 Borrowers in the Bank’s books with new sham lending to 17 \nIntermediary Borrowers, without any discussion of consideration being paid between \nthe two groups. This is only explicable if the entities were under common \nownership/control. \n(3) But BOK/PBC/Primecap were not engaged in the Misappropriation against the \nwishes of those companies’ owners and controllers. D2’s seven-page explanation for \nwhy the Bank should wish to circumnavigate currency controls using a “ flotilla ” of \ncompanies (D2 Opening/¶¶57-70 {AA4/1/24-31}) acknowledges that the flotilla was \na single fleet. But it fails to address the basic question: who was captaining the fleet? \nThe only plausible candidates are D1-2. \nG3 BENEFIT  \n321 We have addressed the Bank’s case that D1-2 were the ultimate beneficiaries of the \nMisappropriation at Section F3 . That material further demonstrates D1-2’s common \nownership and/or control of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers. \nG4 THE NOMINEE AND STRUCTURE CHARTS  \n322 Ds have not challenged the accuracy of the Bank’s Nominee and Structure Charts.163 Rather, \nthey contend that the connections between the Nominees and D1-2 do not support the \ninference that the Nominees were acting for D1-2 as nominee owners of the Borrowers, \nIntermediary Borrowers and D3-8.  \n323 Instead, it appears to be D1-2’s case that it is simple co-incidence that their own nominees \njust happen also to be ostensible beneficial owners of companies who were involved in \ndefrauding their Bank. But no explanation is given as to why D1-2 would continue to use \nthese very same nominees to hold their valuable assets under oral arrangements, and to \nemploy them via PBC and then Sunaltezza, if they were involved in the extraction of billions \nof US dollars from D1-2’s Bank, without D1-2’s knowledge and approval.  \n \n163  The Bank has identified one minor correction to the Charts: from 17.8.13, Albroath’s shares were held on trust \nfor Trukulych {K3-B/25L/1}, such that Trykulych should be substituted for Ryazantseva on the Mikuran \nStructure Chart (this structure is portrayed correctly in other Structure Charts).  The Nominee Charts for \nTrykulych and Ryazantseva should also be read subject to this correction. \n{AA2/15/166}\nAA2/15/180\n174 (1) D1’s position \n324 D1’s main point appears to be that the Nominees could have been working for other \n“principals ” (i.e. other than D1-2) when acting as nominee UBOs and directors of the \nBorrowers, Intermediary Borrowers and D3-8: D1 Opening/¶101 {AA3/1/32}. As to that: \n(1) D1’s pleaded case is that the other “ ultimate owners ” of the Borrowers were further PBC \nemployees: D1 RRFI {A2/"}

As to that: \n(1) D1’s pleaded case is that the other “ ultimate owners ” of the Borrowers were further PBC \nemployees: D1 RRFI {A2/26/2-3} (¶¶2-3) and D1 RRFI {A2/30.1/29-32} (¶¶23-\n24). That does not begin to make any sense. It is not consistent with those PBC \nemployees also being professional nominees. Indeed, it means that, where they have \nadmitted partial interests in Borrowers, D1-2’s case is that they were beneficial owners \nof companies alongside PBC employees – a frankly absurd notion.  \n(2) There is no evidence that the PBC nominees took instructions from individuals other \nthan D1-2 in relation to the affairs of the Borrowers, Intermediary Borrowers and D3-\n8. The lack of originating instructions is explicable if the ultimate owners of those \nentities were D1-2, who communicated with the leaders at Primecap (Novikov), BOK \n(Gurieva) and PBC (Melnyk) in ways which left no trace.  \n(3) It is inexplicable if those companies were instead owned and controlled by a plethora \nof genuinely independent third parties. If that were the case, the Court would expect \nto see swathes of instructions from those third parties to the Bank, PBC and Primecap \nin relation to the affairs of the Borrowers, Intermediary Borrowers and D3-8, directing \nthem to enter into loans, grant pledges, enter into supply agreements etc. There are no \nsuch documents. Nor are there any documents from third party owners/controllers \nauthorising BOK, PBC or Primecap to use the Borrowers, Intermediary Borrowers \nand D3-8 in the transaction patterns which constituted the Misappropriation. \n(4) The final nail in the coffin is that, following nationalisation, D2 (allegedly at D1’s \nrequest) employed 11 PBC employees through Sunaltezza: see Section B2 .  \n325 D1 also complains that the documents relied on by the Bank for three Nominee Charts are \n“from the distant past ” (D1 Opening/¶102 {AA3/1/33}). As to that:  \n(1) Aboyan  {K4-A/4}. The Chart shows Aboyan as the beneficiary, as at 2007, of a \nnumber of companies in which D1-2 later admit interests in their WFO Asset \nDisclosure. The connections are based on Aboyan’s December 2007 ‘resume’ at {K3-\nB/446L}, prepared by Gninenko (at the time, an employee of Novikov’s Investment \nBusiness Department, later a Primecap employee and a member of the Lafferty \nSpreadsheet team). In the ‘resume’, Aboyan claims to be a private businessman and \n{AA2/15/34}\nAA2/15/181\n175 the “ beneficiary owner of different trading companies which operate on [the] Ukrainian metallurgical \nand real estate market ”. Those companies include Crestmond Enterprises, Olbi \nProduction, Edgar Alstorm Holdings and Glos Trading {K3-B/446L/4}, all of which \nappear in D1-2’s WFO Asset Disclosure.  \n(2) Derishev  {K4-A/8} was an employee of the Bank from 11.4.96 until 30.6.15, at \nwhich point he was an employee of the Investment Business Department (under \nNovikov): {K3-C2/129}. He was the purported nominee of only one borrower – \nDensitron. That is one of the Cypriot Borrowers that was treated in exactly the same \nway as – and acted in concert with – Celastrina, which D1 admitted in the Pinchuk \nProceedings that he owns or controls (but denies doing so in these proceedings). It is \nwholly improbable that he held Densitron as a genuine UBO. \n(3) Tymshyn  {K4-A/30}: \n(a) It is correct that the links are generally historic, but they are also significant. For \nexample, ( i) Tymshyn was CEO of Privat Intertrading (which historically held a \nsignificant stake in the Bank for D1-2: see {K3-C3/1}); ( ii) he was on the \nsupervisory board of OGOK and NFP in the early 2000s (when D1-2 acquired \nth"}

For \nexample, ( i) Tymshyn was CEO of Privat Intertrading (which historically held a \nsignificant stake in the Bank for D1-2: see {K3-C3/1}); ( ii) he was on the \nsupervisory board of OGOK and NFP in the early 2000s (when D1-2 acquired \ntheir stakes: see {I3/11/9} ¶¶33-34); and ( iii) he held positions at their oil \nrefinery (Naftochimik Prikarpattya) and chemical company (Dniproazot). \n(b) Tymshyn appears as the purported UBO of nine Borrowers and two \nIntermediary Borrowers. In all cases, he holds his interest via Grandos \nEnterprises (see e.g. the Cambel Structure Chart {K4-B3/4}). Grandos (a \nLafferty Spreadsheets Company) was at all times wholly owned and controlled \nby D2, and was the entity through which he funded Hotel Split (see the \ndocuments in {AA6/16/1}), albeit D2 has not admitted any interest in any \nBorrowers/Intermediary Borrowers via Grandos.  \n326 As to D1’s remaining points (D1 Opening/¶102 {AA3/1/33-34}):  \n(1) The Bank has occasionally had to use undated or historic documents to evidence the \nownership structure of the relevant entities. In the absence of any evidence that the \nCharts are wrong (Ds were required to identify any such errors in advance of trial \n{A6/100/2} (¶3), and none of them have served updated responses since the trial \nbegan: see {A6/106/3} (¶6)), the Charts are the best evidence the Court has as to the \nownership structures of the Relevant Entities on the snapshot dates.  \nAA2/15/182\n176 (2) The YouControl extracts were initially used instead of official registry extracts because \nthe Ukrainian corporate registry was offline as a result of the war. The registry has \nsince resumed service and the Bank has replaced all the YouControl references in the \nCharts with references to the registry {L/173.1}. \n(3) D1’s criticism of “ account fact sheets, bank questionnaires or disclosure statements ” as not being \n“official documents showing ownership ” of a particular entity, but instead “ secondary documents \nprepared by the Bank itself ” seemingly overlooks the fact that it was D1-2 who were in \ncontrol of the Bank when the documents were produced. In any event, this is – as we \nhave said – the best available evidence. \n(2) D2’s position  \n327 D2 contends that “ The mere fact that some individuals can apparently be linked both to [D2] and the \nBorrowers cannot overcome the absence of evidence that [D2] controlled any of the Borrowers. The relevant \nindividuals were employees of PBC, which provided nominee services to the Bank (amongst others) ”: D2 \nOpening/Table2(7) {AA4/1/66}.164 That assertion is divorced from reality in every respect: \n(1) The word “ apparently ” can be ignored: ( i) D2 has not sought to contend that the \nStructure Charts inaccurately reflect the documents ( cp. {A6/100/2}) and ( ii) D2 has \nsworn affidavit evidence that 20165 of the PBC nominees and one former Bank \nemployee who appear as purported UBOs of the Borrowers and Intermediary \nBorrowers in the Structure Charts held assets for him on ‘oral agreements’ (the saga \nin relation to those ‘oral agreements’ is addressed in Section C3  above).  \n(2) The proposition that PBC “ provided nominee services to the Bank ” is demonstrably false: it \nprovided nominees to D1 and D2, as D2 eventually admitted in correspondence in \n{L/155} ( ¶4). In any event, the Bank did not need a corporate services provider to \nprovide nominees to it; rather, as the documents and witness evidence made clear, the \nBank’s employees were used as nominees by D1-2.166 \n(3) In many cases, the structures by which D1-2 hold their admitted assets are replicated \nin the Structure Charts.

The Bank presented one such example to the Court in respect \nof AEF in the course of its D1 Document Presentation at {Day3/97:1} - \n{Day3/99:4}; this, together with other examples, are set out at Appendix G1 . \n(4) D2 has also failed entirely to engage with the wider overlap between his asset \ndisclosure and the companies and CSP employees that appear as intermediate \nshareholders in the Structure Charts:167  \n(a) Of the 110 intermediate shareholding companies that appear in the Structure \nCharts, 54 appear in D1-2’s Asset Disclosure as holding assets on their behalf; \n57 were Lafferty Spreadsheets Companies and nine are Share Pledge companies. \nThese companies also appear in D1-2’s disclosed contemporaneous asset lists \nand in the structures by which D1 and D2 admit holding their interests in the \nBorrowers and Intermediary Borrowers between 2013 and 2016: see Bank \nOpening/Sch. 7  {AA2/2/33}. \n(b) Only 15 of the intermediate shareholding companies do not fall into any of these \ncategories. One of these companies is itself an Intermediary Borrower in which \nboth D1 and D2 admit to holding interests (Mizar); the purported UBO(s) of \n12 of the remaining 14 companies were PBC or Bank employees.168 And the \npurported UBOs of the remaining two have other close links with D1-2.169 \n(c) Of the 64 (mainly Cypriot) individual shareholders who appear in the Structure \nCharts, 43 appear in D1-2’s WFO Asset Disclosure as directly or indirectly \nholding assets on their behalf and more appear in D1-2’s disclosed \ncontemporaneous asset lists. At least 39 are employees or former employees of \nthe Cypriot CSPs identified in Bank Opening/¶98 {AA2/1/48} See Bank \nOpening/Sch. 7 {AA2/2/33}.  \n \n167  The figures in these sub-paragraphs correct the figures given at Bank Opening/¶281 {AA2/1/120-121}. \n168  Austen Ltd; Croniex Holdings Ltd; Elite Systems Ltd; Entry7 LLC; Ferona LLC (with the exception of Vitalyi \nTymshyn, one of five purported UBOs); Intersplav LLC (with the exception of Andrii Kohmutov, one of nine \npurported UBOs); Macros LLC; Palmara LLC; Prime Group LLC; Quentional Investments Ltd; Rontex Inc; \nSouthfield Admin Ltd. \n169  They were: ( i) Dmitry Potishman, who is the purported UBO of intermediate shareholder Eltima Investments \nLtd, which holds a 10% stake in Alfatrader (a Borrower in which D1 and D2 admit a combined 90% interest) \n{K4-B3/2}; and ( ii) Yevgen Zasimenko, the purported UBO of intermediate shareholder Bersel Inc, which \nheld a minority indirect stake in Borrower Elsis Time {K4-B3/9}.

Instead, he says, the documents \nshow that Bank employees were engaged in efforts to prevent breaches of the N7 ratio \n(maximum amount of credit risk per counterparty), N8 ratio (large credit risks) and N9 ratio \n(maximum credit risk for all related party transactions): see, for an introduction to these \nratios, Beketov8/¶¶444-450 {C1/1/152-153}. \n329 This is a bad point premised on a misunderstanding of the Bank’s case and a failure to \nrecognise that the N7, N8, N9 ratio issues and the need to hide visible connections with D1-\n2 were all part of the same related party lending problem: \n(1) The Bank relies on the Luchaninov Email, Rokoman Spreadsheets and similar \ndocuments to evidence the ability of employees within BOK to procure changes to \nthe directors and purported UBOs of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers \nwithout reference to any independent owners of those entities. The fact that it was \npossible for them to juggle the nominees as they did is fundamentally inconsistent \nwith any case that these nominees in fact represented some unidentified independent \nthird-party owner(s).  \n(2) It is now clear that D2 does not dispute that this was the case. In particular, he accepts \nthe description of the PBC nominees as “ fungible ” (D2 Opening/¶21 {AA4/1/11}) \nand he further accepts that “ Bank employees sometimes took steps to alter the connections between \nborrowers (for example by changing directors, or even sometimes ‘unlinking’ beneficial owners) in order \nto comply with the credit risk ratios on related party lending ” (D2 Opening/¶73 {AA4/1/32}). \n(3) D2’s ‘alternative explanation’ focuses on the specific motive for the various different \nacts of juggling. But the distinction between Bank employees procuring changes to \nthe borrowers’ directors and purported UBOs intending to conceal D1-2’s ultimate \n{AA2/15/29}\nAA2/15/185\n179 ownership and their doing the same but to comply with credit ratios is a false one. \nThese two things were inextricably linked. The difficulties the Bank had in complying \nwith credit ratios arose out of the volume of related-party lending to D1-2’s \ncompanies: \n(a) There was so much related-party lending at the Bank that it was not possible to \nassign a separate nominal UBO to each corporate borrower. Instead, as the \nBeneficiary Key and Rokoman Spreadsheet demonstrate, a single nominal UBO \nwould be assigned a large number of companies. The same is true of directors. \n(b) This all made sense from an administration perspective. But it also meant that \nthere was a real risk that the Bank would breach its credit ratios. For example,  \n(i) The N7 ratio calculates the ratio of ( i) the Bank’s lending to a group of \nrelated counterparties against ( ii) the Bank’s regulatory capital. \nAccordingly, if the NBU decided that a particular beneficiary"}

For example,  \n(i) The N7 ratio calculates the ratio of ( i) the Bank’s lending to a group of \nrelated counterparties against ( ii) the Bank’s regulatory capital. \nAccordingly, if the NBU decided that a particular beneficiary – who was \nthe nominal UBO of, say, 20 borrowers – was indeed related to the Bank, \nthis could cause an immediate breach of the N7 ratio. \n(ii) The same NBU decision could also affect the N8 ratio (if the lending was \nqualified as a ‘large credit risk’) or the N9 ratio. As the documents show, \nthe Bank’s typical response was to propose a change to the nominal UBO \nor director for someone who the NBU had not (yet) decided was a related \nparty. Indeed, on occasion the change was made pre-emptively because \nthere was a concern that the NBU would decide that a person was related. \n(iii) An internal decision to recycle a loan from a company nominally owned \nby Beneficiary 1 into a loan granted to a company nominally owned by \nBeneficiary 2 might also trigger a credit ratio breach. And again, this had \nto be managed by the juggling of nominal beneficial owners. \n(c) So there was a game of cat and mouse between the Bank and the NBU. \nSometimes the immediate reason for an instruction to remove a nominal \nbeneficial owner or a director was to get rid of the connection between the \ncompany in question and D1-2 ( e.g. in the aftermath of the Nashi Groshi articles, \nas explained further below). In other cases, the immediate impetus may well \nhave been a concern that N7, N8 and N9 ratios would be breached. But this \nwas only a problem because of ( i) the volume of fraudulent related party \n‘lending’ that had been granted to D1-2’s companies in the first place, and ( ii) \nAA2/15/186\n180 the systems that BOK, PBC and Primecap had set up to administer the \ncompanies to whom that lending was granted. \n(d) Getting hung up on the motive for a particular change also distracts from the \nmost important point of all, that it was possible for the Bank employees to make \nthe changes at all. In short, the act of juggling the Bank’s vast related-party debt \nby changing directors and purported UBOs to avoid formal breaches of credit \nlimits was only possible because the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers \nwere under D1-2’s common control, exercised through the Bank, PBC and \nPrimecap. \n(4) In any event, at least in relation to the Luchaninov Email, it is quite clear that the \npurpose of Mr Luchaninov’s proposals was to conceal D1-2’s connections to 24 of \nthe Borrowers.  \n(2) Changing directors and purported UBOs \n330 As set out above, D2 accepts that it was common practice for BOK to procure changes to \ndirectors and/or purported UBOs of the Bank’s borrowers. We make four points about \nthat:  \n331 First, it is clear that the Bank had difficulty complying with the N7 / N8 / N9 ratios170 and \nthat BOK employees proposed changes to directors and purported UBOs in order to give \nthe (false) appearance of compliance with those ratios (see Luchaninov XX {Day9/85:18} \n- {Day9/90:7}). But creating a façade of compliance with credit ratios was not D1-2 and the \nBank’s only concern: \n(1) From October 2014 onward, the Bank’s refinancing loans from the NBU required the \nBank to cease “ to carry out active operations with the entities related to the [Bank ]” (see e.g. \n{E5/309/5} (2.10.14) (¶3.3.15), {E7/111.3/6} (5.12.14) (¶3.3.16)). Breach of these \nrequirements gave the NBU the right to demand early repayment of the loans, which \nwas likely to cause a severe liquidity crisis for the Bank: see Rozhkova1/¶¶138-139 \n \n170  The alternative ‘solution’ was to procure repayment of the offending borrowers’ debts as part of the loan \nrecycling ( i.e. replace a borrower in breach"}
{"start": 507500, "text": "se “ to carry out active operations with the entities related to the [Bank ]” (see e.g. \n{E5/309/5} (2.10.14) (¶3.3.15), {E7/111.3/6} (5.12.14) (¶3.3.16)). Breach of these \nrequirements gave the NBU the right to demand early repayment of the loans, which \nwas likely to cause a severe liquidity crisis for the Bank: see Rozhkova1/¶¶138-139 \n \n170  The alternative ‘solution’ was to procure repayment of the offending borrowers’ debts as part of the loan \nrecycling ( i.e. replace a borrower in breach of the N7 ratio with a different borrower whose aggregate \nindebtedness was below the relevant limits): see e.g. {E11/259}, {E11/260P}. It seems, however, that the \nreason the Bank relied so heavily on changing directors and UBOs in the period from early 2015 onwards in \norder to disguise relatedness (rather than simply recycling the lending to new borrowers) is that it did not have \nthe liquidity (or the freedom) to issue fresh loans. It is striking in this regard that the last Intermediary \nDrawdown was on 9.6.15. \nAA2/15/187\n181 {B1/5/33-34}. From early 2016, Resolution 103/BT likewise prevented “ asset \noperations with related parties ” {E12/313/3}.  \n(2) As set out below, D1 and D2 had made representations to the Bank’s auditors PwC \nas to which parties were and were not related for the purposes of the Bank’s IFRS \nfinancial statements. Following the EY Related Parties Report {E17/242} and the \nNBU’s 31.7.15 letter (which designated 165 companies as related parties, subject to \nobjection by the Bank: {E10/266}), a memo was circulated (to Yatsenko, Rokoman, \nMedvedev, Mr Luchaninov and others) noting that many of those companies had not \nbeen included as related parties in previous IFRS financial statements. It warned that: \n“if [additional borrowers ] are added to the [IFRS related party ] list for 2Q of 2015, there is a great \nchance of re-issuing the Bank’s [IFRS financial statements ] for previous period of reporting, at least \nfor 2010 – 2014 years ” {E10/268.1} (see red text). \n(3) In relation to the Borrowers in particular, from November 2014 onwards, there was \npress speculation and a criminal investigation into the use of the Borrowers to \nmisappropriate the Bank’s funds. See Section L1 below. \n332 Accordingly, concealing the extent of related-party lending served multiple immediate \npurposes. But that does not detract from the obviously ultimate imperative, which was hide \nthe fact that the vast majority of the Bank’s corporate lending was to entities controlled by \nD1 and D2. \n333 Secondly, BOK employees treated information about purported UBOs and proposed \nchanges to the same as matters to be kept strictly secret even from other Bank departments: \n(1) On 19.6.14, Mr Luchaninov emailed his subordinate to explain that the purpose of a \nmeeting was “ to state the urgency of the disaffiliating problem, suggest the deadlines and discuss the \ninformation sharing procedure, since traces of information in email and PrivatDoc is extremely \nundesirable. I am going to have a conference call with Mr T. Yu. Novikov at 20:00 today, I will \nhave a preliminary discussion ” {E4/47} (emphasis added). As we explain below, Novikov \nwas regularly involved in the process of “ disaffiliating ” companies.  \n(2) The Beneficiary Key (which the parties agree should be used to decipher the Rokoman \nSpreadsheet) was produced in the following circumstances:171 \n \n171  As Morgachov alluded to in his exchange with Novikov, this was not the first time the Bank used alpha-\nnumeric coding to conceal beneficiaries. See Tabakov’s 19.8.14 email to Mr Luchaninov encoding the \npurported UBOs of offshore companies: {E4/287}, {E4/288P} (spreadsheet with names) and {E4/290P} \n(names replaced with numbers). \n{AA2/15/303}\nAA2/15/188\n182 (a) On 19.9.14, the Bank’s Risk Management Department sent a memorandum to \nDubilet {E5/189}.

It was headed “ Providing access to data on clients of the Cyprus \nbranch ”, and explained that as a result of a recent NBU audit “ borrowers were \nidentified as groups related through their nominal holders at the Cyprus branch ”. Dubilet \nwas asked to approve a proposal to “ ... allow [the Bank’s employees in Ukraine ] access \nto information on the nominee and beneficial owners, executives, chairmen and members of the \nSupervisory Board of Borrowers at the Cyprus Branch. In order to maintain the confidentiality \nof the information, we suggest providing access to client data without the name or surname .” \n(emphasis added). Yatsenko’s comment on the memo was “ Denied – all work \nmust be done in the Cyprus branch ” (see bottom of {E5/189/3}). \n(b) Dubilet forwarded the memo to Novikov {E5/189}, who in turn had the \nfollowing exchange with Morgachov:  \nNovikov “How will the analysis be conducted if there is no access to the \nsurnames? How, technically, if we give access to the databases, \nwill they protect information on the names of the beneficiaries (in \nparticular)?” \nMorgachov  “we will number them – the same beneficiaries – the same \nnumbers; we already did a test run for several companies in \nAugust, seems like it worked.” \n(c) Morgachov’s proposal was endorsed. On 8.5.15, Stojanova (Cyprus branch) \nsent a copy of what had grown into a substantial Excel spreadsheet to \nMorgachova {E9/170}. The body of the email was blank, with the subject line \nreading ‘HO’ ( i.e. Head Office). The attachment, headed, “ Borrowers and \nguarantors HO-BEN ”, is an Excel spreadsheet with a single workbook made up \nof 2,081 rows and ten columns (the “Beneficiary Key” {E9/171P}). \n(3) On 21.8.15, Ms Lozytska emailed Mr Luchaninov and others with a “ summary list of \nBOK customer structure ”{E11/19.1 } {E11/19.2P}. She explained that: “ Corporate Client \nServices is unable to further analyse major shareholdings by ultimate beneficial owners, since it only \nhas information on nominal shareholders ”. \n(4) On 2.10.15, Ms Lozytska provided Rokoman with “ a real life example of the improvement \nrequired by the NBU ” which included a structure chart and an Excel spreadsheet setting \nout the ownership structure of Vesta Company: {E11/234} {E11/236P}. Ms \nLozytska’s table at {E11/236P} included “ the first level of ownership ” (columns C – F), \nthe “ second level of ownership ” (columns G – J), the “ third level of ownership ” (columns K – \nN) and “ ultimate beneficiary ” (columns O – S). Rokoman’s comment on her \nAA2/15/189\n183 subordinate’s work was: “… I think it would be better to stop at a column ‘N’ in the table – \nand the rest should be deleted ” {E11/234}. \n334 Thirdly, the process by which directors and purported UBOs were shuffled in and out of \ncompanies was not revealed to the NBU (or any other third parties). Instead, the NBU and \nothers were told brazen lies about the beneficial ownership of the Bank’s borrowers: \n(1) On 13.2.14, Pikush explained that the NBU auditors had not been given access to \nCyprus branch documents relating to ultimate ownership of the Bank’s borrowers. \nHis proposed solution was to “ hav[e] Morgachev bring the ‘right’ documents in Donetsk and \nshow them to the auditors and then get out ” {E3/65}. Dubilet and Novikov approved \nPikush’s plan. Morgachov’s flying visit, complete with a suitcase of the “ right” \ndocuments, was repeated in 2016: Luchaninov/¶¶49-50 {B1/3/13}.

The Court \nshould infer that the “ right” documents were, in fact, the wrong documents, intended \nto mislead the NBU as to the ultimate ownership of the Cyprus branch customers (see \nLuchaninov XX {Day9/90:8-19}).  \n(2) In the build-up to the publication of the EY Related Parties Report, the Bank was \nconcerned to ‘get ahead’ of the EY investigation into related parties. On 23.6.15, \nMedvedev delegated the following “ task” to eight Bank employees and Melnyk: “ ... \nimmediately disassociate the Bank from YULYA ... VELK and PAVLO ... RZHEVSKY ” \n{E10/119}. His proposal was to remove them as shareholders of a company called \nGIRTS (Cherkassy) LLC, which was already on the Bank’s related parties list such \nthat, as long as Velk and Rzhevskyy (both PBC employees) remained shareholders in \nGIRTS, any companies in which they were shareholders or directors would also be \nclassified as related parties.172 Medvedev had clearly given this a lot of thought: \n(a) Mr Luchaninov and another Bank employee were to provide Melnyk with “... \ncandidatures of the 2 new owners of the shares in GIRTS ... and prepare some reserve \n[candidates ] (4 ... 5 people) for a possible replacement of the owners of [other] related companies \n.... These may be employees of your departments or other departments of the Bank  ....”. \n(b) Melnyk was told to “ prepare the Minutes and share purchase agreements for VELK and \nRZHEVSKY in GIRTS ... in favour of new owners ”, whose identities would be \nconfirmed by Mr Luchaninov and his colleague. Medvedev went on: “ The dates \n \n172  See Luchaninov/¶¶80-85 {B1/3/19}. \nAA2/15/190\n184 of the Minutes and agreements shall be agreed upon .... We will show these Minutes and \nagreements to the auditors [sc. EY]”. \n(c) If the above could be completed within “ 1-2 days ”, then EY could be told: ( i) \n“On such and such a date (for example in May), the Bank notified Mrs ... Velk and Mr ... \nRzhevsky that, due to changes in current legislation, ... they will become related parties of the \nbank .... ”; (ii) “On such and such a date (we need to think which date) Mrs ... Velk informed \nthe bank of her disagreement at being considered as a related party .... [Mr] Rzhevsky will \nsend a similar letter ”; and ( iii) “Regardless of what the auditors write about this matter, by \nthe time the Bank receives an order from the NBU ... the Bank should respond that Velk \nand Rzhevsky are no longer related parties .... ”173 (emphasis added). \n(d) Medvedev’s plan was put into effect: ( i) Putjatin174 proposed two Bank \nemployees to take over from Velk and Rzhevskyy, whose names were supplied \nto Melnyk {E10/180}; ( ii) Melnyk provided the draft documentation for Velk \nand Rzhevskyy’s retirement and replacement as shareholders;175 and ( iii) EY \nwere told by the Bank (as was duly recorded in the EY Related Parties Report) \nthat Velk and Rzhevskyy had “ expressed her [his] desire to sell stake in  [GIRTS ]”: \n{E17/242/28-29}.176 \n(e) Extraordinarily, D2’s counsel described this episode as “ a perfectly proper attempt \nto ensure that [GIRTS ] didn’t become a connected party for the purposes of credit \nconcentrations ” {Day9/96:14-16}.177 There was nothing ‘proper’ about swapping \nout nominee shareholders and lying to EY about how that had come about, in \norder to give the false appearance that Velk and Rzhevskyy were not individuals \nconnected to the Bank (such that the debts of other companies associated with \nthem should be excluded from the calculation of the Bank’s credit ratios). \n(3) On 16.7.15, the EY Related Parties Report {E17/242} was issued and, on 31.7.15, the \nNBU wrote to the Bank designating 165 companies as related {E10/266} (the “165 "}

The Bank then had the opportunity to object to their designation by providing \n \n173  The next day, Bank employees realised that the problem they had thought related to six companies in fact \narose in relation to 40 companies: {E10/122} (the attachment is not available as a result of a technical issue). \n174 The Deputy Head of Payments and Transfers {E10/180/4}. \n175  {E11/86}, {E11/87}, {E11/88}, {E11/89}, {E11/90}. Amusingly, Mr Melnyk noted that if Velk and \nRzhevskyy had to travel from Dnipro to Cherkassy to sign documents, they would need to have their travel \nexpenses reimbursed. \n176  In the EY Related Parties Report, GIRTS is referred to as ‘Miskyi rozrakhunkovo-informatsiinyi tsentr’. \n177  But this is not what was happening. The purpose of this episode from the perspective of Medvedev et al. was \nnot “to ensure that [GIRTS ] didn’t become a connected party ”; its purpose was to ensure that customers of the Bank \nin which Velk and Rzhevskyy held roles did not become the Bank’s related parties. \nAA2/15/191\n185 proper information as to the ultimate owners of the 165 List companies \n(Rozhkova1/¶113 {B1/5/28}). The EY Related Parties Report records that the Bank \nrefused to provide information on UBOs of borrowers {E17/242/47-48} (text below \ntable), and Ms Rozhkova said in evidence that companies were included on the 165 \nList not because it was clear to the NBU that they were owned and/or controlled by \nD1-2, but because “ we recognised the Bank just trying to hide the real ownership structure of its \nclients to avoid a situation when the Bank can breach the N9 ratio ” {Day8/89:15-21}.  \n(4) On 2.9.15, Dubilet sent the Bank’s initial response to the NBU following the EY \nRelated Parties Report and the 165 List in which Dubilet claimed to provide “ evidence \nthat the 73 parties mentioned below are not related to the Bank ” {E11/104} {E11/103}. As \nto that:  \n(a) The “ list of parties not treated by the Bank as related ” included entities which D1-2 \nhave admitted in these proceedings that they had significant interests in, \nincluding Alfatrader {A1/16} {A1/19/3} (45% each) and Privat Intertrading \n{J2/3/99} {J4/5/97} (D1: 54.97%; D2: 45%); and \n(b) The explanations given in the accompanying documents were patently false. For \nexample, the “ objections ” in relation to Techspets at {E18/44} asserted that “ the \nownership structure of the client is transparent and allows determining the final beneficiaries. \nThe current final beneficiaries and managerial staff of [Techspets ] are not related to the bank .” \nAs Techspets’ structure chart shows, at the time of the Misappropriation, its \nstructure was anything but “ transparent ” and its purported UBOs were (with one \nexception) PBC nominees: {K4-B3/42 }. By the date of Dubilet’s response, a \nclient questionnaire prepared by the Bank ({K3-C1/362.1}, dated 1.8.15) \nsuggested that its shareholders had been changed to an ‘Oceans 11’ structure \ninvolving five BVI, three Belizean and three Nevis companies; no “ controllers ” \nwere identified; and its “ managerial staff ” comprised a single PBC employee, \nAkimova. \n(5) At about that time, in September 2015, Avellum was engaged by the Bank to assist \nwith the Bank’s response to the EY Related Parties Report and the 165 List.

Avellum \nrepeatedly suggested that the Bank could tell the truth by giving full disclosure of the \nultimate ownership and control of the 165 List companies. That is not what happened: \n(a) On 4.9.15, Avellum suggested that the Bank could disclose the ownership \nstructure of the borrowers “ all the way up to the beneficial owners, showing that none of \nAA2/15/192\n186 the beneficiaries exercise influence on the company ” (first bullet) but, as an alternative, \nthe Bank could “ adjust the company’s ownership structure so that none of the group’s \ninsiders have any influence over the company …” (second bullet) {E11/123/3}.  \n(b) On 8.9.15, Avellum commented on draft amended ‘objections’ to be sent to the \nNBU in relation to 73 of the 165 List companies {E11/133}. Avellum’s \ncomments included suggesting that the Bank “ specify [a] list of LLC Elsis Time \nBeneficiaries ” and “ consider disclosing the end beneficiaries so as to confirm that the Bank’s \ninsiders are not present in the structure ” {E11/134}. Again, the option to give full \ndisclosure was eschewed.  \n(c) On 6.10.15, Avellum advised ( inter alia ) on a group of c. 100 companies “ in which \nthe nominal beneficiaries are non-residents and the real beneficiary owners are one or more of \nthe Bank insiders ( ‘Group 3 ’)”. Avellum advised that the NBU “ most likely, would not \nbelieve that the citizens of Cyprus are real beneficiaries of the business in Ukraine, the only \neffective solution is to substitute beneficial owners from the Bank’s insiders for Ukrainian \nresidents not affiliated with the Bank ” {E11/261/3}. On 8.10.15, Avellum advised \nthat: “ ... it is necessary to (1) discontinue any existing relations between the real beneficiary \nand nominal beneficiaries (if any), and (2) sign a trust deed ... between the nominal beneficiaries \nand a new real beneficiary which should not be the Bank’s insider ” and “ ... if the Bank is \nnot able to provide a sufficient number of new beneficiaries to implement an ideal structure, it \nis possible to consider the acquisition of Group 3 companies by one or several beneficiaries on \nthe same day ” (latter emphasis in original): {E11/265/2}. \n(d) On 30.11.15, Dubilet wrote to the NBU to say that the Bank had “ negotiated with \nthe beneficial owners of the borrowing companies and obtained prior consent from them to \nsimplify the corporate structure ” on the basis that the changes would reveal that the \nborrowers were not related to the Bank: {E12/93/2}. There is no evidence of \nany such negotiations between the Bank and independent third-party owners of \nthe 165 List borrowers. On the contrary, the Avellum advice which preceded \nthis letter (and the emails to Novikov below) show that any changes to the \nborrowers’ structures were being dealt with by BOK employees. This was a lie \nto the NBU to conceal the fact that the Bank, of its own accord (and with D1-\n2’s approval), was able to amend the ownership structures of the 165 List \nborrowers without reference to anyone else. \nAA2/15/193\n187 (6) On 1.12.15, Mr Luchaninov emailed Yatsenko to explain that “ we got another request from \nthe NBU about non-residents. The NBU is asking for the ownership structure and confirming \ndocuments for 151 non-resident clients ”. Yatsenko’s response was blunt: “ we won’t give that \ninformation ” {E12/95}. When Mr Luchaninov then prepared a draft response to the \nNBU “ with arguments that there are no grounds to provide documents for 151 non-residents ”, \nYatsenko succinctly summarised the Bank’s approach: “ stalling ” {E12/96}.  \n(7) At no point was the NBU told by the Bank: ‘we’re going to comply with the N7 / N8 \n/ N9 credit ratios by procuring artificial changes to th"}

On the contrary, the NBU was given the false impression that \nindividuals like Velk and Rzhevskyy were genuine third-party owners of the Bank’s \ncustomers, and information on true beneficial owners of the offshore shareholders of \nthe Bank’s Ukrainian borrowers was deliberately withheld. \n335 Fourthly, the process of changing nominee UBOs of the Bank’s borrowers was referred to \nthe most senior employees at the Bank (in particular Gurieva, Novikov and Dubilet):  \n(1) On 7.9.15, Yatsenko forwarded the 165 List to Gurieva and Novikov {E10/283}. \nThey must have discussed how to respond to the same. \n(2) Between 9.10.15 and 20.11.15, Novikov was asked to procure changes to the beneficial \nowners and/or directors of ( inter alia ) 19 Borrowers and five Intermediary Borrowers:  \nDate Email178 Reference \n9.10.15 Email from Mr Luchaninov to Yatsenko containing the draft text of an \nemail from Yatsenko to Novikov: \n“Please organise the task to oversee the process of changing the beneficial owners in \nclient companies, according to the attached list …” \nThe list includes 10 companies, including four Borrowers (Investgroup, \nFavore, Tseris, and Tamersa) and one Intermediary Borrower (Anabis). \nMr Luchaninov sent Yatsenko the ownership structures of the 10 companies \nlater the same day in a password-protected file: {E11/272}, {E11/273P}. {E11/267} \n{E11/268P} \n15.10.15 Email from Mr Luchaninov to Yatsenko with a table of five companies with \na draft message to Novikov to “ organise work on the control of the process of change \nof beneficial owners in client companies, according to the attached list .”  \nThe attached table proposed changing the directors of the companies \n(including three Borrowers: Ribotto, Transmoloko and Inkeriya) in order to \ndisguise their connections with D1-2. {E11/285} \n{E11/286P} \n \n178  All of the emails were sent to Yatsenko’s personal Gmail account (v.a.yatsenko@gmail.com) rather than his \nPrivatBank account ( vladimir.yatsenko@privatbank.ua ).

To those \nsubmissions, we add the following points: \n337 First, the email and its attachments have nothing to do with compliance with credit ratios \n(cp. D2 Opening/¶73 {AA4/1/32}, and cp. Luchaninov XX {Day9/92:2} - {Day9/93:2}). \nRather, it was prompted by the Nashi Groshi articles and the NBU’s ensuing requests \nrelating to the Borrowers’ involvement in the Misappropriation:  \n(1) A timeline , putting the Luchaninov Email in its proper context, is at Appendix L2 . \nIt demonstrates that the Luchaninov Email was prompted by the concern that D1-2 \nmight be linked to the Borrowers identified by Nashi Groshi, which led to an urgent \ninspection of the Bank by the NBU.180 \n \n179  Borrowers: Prominmet, Imris, Vesta-Company, Tamersa, Techspets, Vitella, Intorno; Intermediary Borrowers: \nStimeks, Centrolstal, Mantas. \n180  D2 appeared to accept this was the case: see {Day9/91:22-25}.  \n{AA2/23/3}\nAA2/15/195\n189 (2) The Luchaninov Email states expressly that it has been prepared “ in reference to the \nunplanned audit by [the NBU ] of [42 Borrowers ] who previously received loans from [the Bank ] and \nmade advance payments under international contracts, the attached file contains a preliminary analysis \nof the structure of connections of these loan clients. Considering that there is the risk of connections of \nlending operations to refinancing and persons related to the bank, the document provides suggestions \non the removal of such connections ” {E8/163} (emphasis added). It does not say that there \nis a risk that the 24 Borrowers’ loans would cause breaches of any credit ratios. Nor \ndo any of the attachments analyse or even mention the outstanding balances on the \nloans of the Borrowers, which would be a prerequisite for identifying potential credit \nratio breaches. It is, rather, obvious that the “ risk of connections of lending operations to \nrefinancing ” refers to the Nashi Groshi allegation that the funds drawn down under the \nRelevant Loans derived from the NBU’s refinancing loans to the Bank; and that (given \nthat this is the express subject of the attachments) the “ persons related to the Bank ” were \nD1 and D2. \n(3) Accordingly, and by way of example only, the Luchaninov Email attachments identify \nHaivoronska as Chairman of the supervisory board of Sintez Oil, a member of the \nsupervisory board of NFP, and a director of Metrikom and Rudneks {E8/165/5}. \nNFP and Sintez are identified as being owned by corporate clients of the Cyprus \nbranch, which in turn are identified as being owned by D1-2. Mr Luchaninov does not \nconsider: “ what is the total lending to Sintez Oil, NFP, Metrikom and Rudneks and would it \nbreach the N7/8/9 ratios? ” Instead, he notes Haivoronska must be removed either from \nthe existing related parties"}
{"start": 532000, "text": "pervisory board of Sintez Oil, a member of the \nsupervisory board of NFP, and a director of Metrikom and Rudneks {E8/165/5}. \nNFP and Sintez are identified as being owned by corporate clients of the Cyprus \nbranch, which in turn are identified as being owned by D1-2. Mr Luchaninov does not \nconsider: “ what is the total lending to Sintez Oil, NFP, Metrikom and Rudneks and would it \nbreach the N7/8/9 ratios? ” Instead, he notes Haivoronska must be removed either from \nthe existing related parties (Sintez Oil and NFP) or from the Borrowers (Metrikom \nand Rudneks) in order to prevent any connection between these two Borrowers and \nD1-2’s companies being apparent from the corporate register. \n338 Secondly, the 24 Borrowers analysed in the Luchaninov Email attachments were not already \ndisclosed on the related party lists (see {K3-D/82P}, {K3-D/88P}, {K3-D/94P} (NBU) \nand {K3-E/83P}, {K3-E/89P} (IFRS)), and whilst the Nashi Groshi article speculated on \nthe Borrowers’ links to D1 and D2, information on their full ownership structures was not \nincluded in any official registers, or in information provided by the NBU. The entire purpose \nof the email was to take steps to avoid those 24 Borrowers being linked to D1-2 via their \nAA2/15/196\n190 directors (whose role did appear on the Ukrainian corporate register), and who also appeared \non the supervisory boards of D1-2’s companies (also public knowledge).181 \n339 Thirdly, the above is corroborated by Mr Luchaninov’s evidence: \n(1) Luchaninov/¶53 {B1/3/14} said that, at the meeting which preceded the email, he \nwas given the list of 42 companies and asked to “ (a) analyse whether there were any \nconnections evident from the client information held by the Bank that would link the 42 Companies \nto the Bank’s then owners, i.e. Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov; and (b) if any such connections \nwere evidence, provide guidance on how those connections could be removed ”. His evidence as to \nwhat he was told at that meeting was not challenged in cross-examination.  \n(2) D2’s counsel cross-examined Mr Luchaninov on the basis that the Luchaninov Email \nwas designed to ensure that “ ... parties are not grouped together for the purpose of concentration \nof credit risk ” and that “ you are identifying cross-connections between groups and seeking to eliminate \nthose cross-connections. You’re not trying to hide anything about Mr Kolomoisky and Mr \nBogolyubov ”. The latter question elicited the enigmatic answer: “ Well, we’re not hiding \ninformation about Mr Kolomoisky or Mr Bogolyubov here ” {Day9/92:11} - {Day9/93:2}. \nWhatever Mr Luchaninov meant by this remark does not really matter. The line of \nquestioning proceeded on the fundamentally erroneous premise that the Luchaninov \nEmail was all about “ groups ” and “ concentration of credit risk ”. It was, as we have \nexplained, anything but. \n340 D2’s attempt to lump the Luchaninov Email in as part of a wider “ pattern of behaviour ” by \nwhich the Bank sought to avoid breaches of the N7 / N8 / N9 ratios misses the mark. \n(4) The Rokoman Spreadsheets \n341 The Bank addressed the Rokoman Spreadsheet at Bank Opening/¶¶294-301{AA2/1/124-\n126} and {Day4/1:4} - {Day4/22:9}. The Rokoman Email and Rokoman Spreadsheet are \nat {E10/264} {E10/265P}, and the Updated Rokoman Spreadsheet is at {E10/279.1}, \n{E10/279.2P}, {E10/279.3P}. These are damning documents for the reasons there \nsummarised, confirming the way in which Rokoman and D1-2’s representatives in BOK \n \n181  D2 submits that “[ t]he companies which the Luchaninov Email accepted were related by virtue of Mr Bogolyubov and Mr \nKolomoisky’s interests were all included in either the Bank’s IFRS or NBU lists as at 1.4.15 or shortly thereafter ”: D2 \nOpening/Table 2(3)(a)(ii) {AA4/1/63}. But that is nothing to the point: those companies, which included \nNFP, were well known to be owned by D1 and D2: it was the other companies i.e. the Borrowers in which \nD1-2’s interests were not known that was the concern; "}
{"start": 535500, "text": " submits that “[ t]he companies which the Luchaninov Email accepted were related by virtue of Mr Bogolyubov and Mr \nKolomoisky’s interests were all included in either the Bank’s IFRS or NBU lists as at 1.4.15 or shortly thereafter ”: D2 \nOpening/Table 2(3)(a)(ii) {AA4/1/63}. But that is nothing to the point: those companies, which included \nNFP, were well known to be owned by D1 and D2: it was the other companies i.e. the Borrowers in which \nD1-2’s interests were not known that was the concern; it was D1-2’s associations with these D1-2 companies, \nvia their directors, that the Bank was trying to conceal. In the context of the NBU inspection following the \nNashi Groshi articles, the Bank’s plan succeeded: the NBU concluded that “ No facts have been found of relationships \nof the non-resident legal entities, the owners of the Branch’s customers [i.e. the Borrowers ], with the insiders and the Bank’s related \nparties ” {E9/214.1/2}. \nAA2/15/197\n191 could and did manipulate nominee beneficial owners and directors of their companies on \ntheir behalf. D2 Opening/Table2(4) {AA4/1/65} makes a series of curious submissions in \nan apparent but misguided attempt to minimise their significance: \n(1) D2 says that no changes are proposed in relation to any of the ‘B4’ companies (‘B4’ \nbeing the code allocated to D2 in the Beneficiary Key). That is correct but irrelevant.  \n(2) D2 says that the Rokoman Spreadsheet, Rokoman Directors Spreadsheet and \nRokoman Updated Spreadsheet “[ do] not propose changes to the beneficial owners of any \nBorrower ” and do not “ propose changes to the shareholders of any of the Borrowers themselves ” \n(D2 Opening/Table2(4)(a)(iii) and (b) {AA4/1/65}, Sch. 4 p.20 {AA4/5/20}). That \nis not correct. 21 of the companies identified in the Updated Rokoman Spreadsheet \nwere shareholders in one or more of the Borrowers; and 11 of those companies had \ntheir beneficiary changed before or shortly after 6.8.15: {AA2/2/6-7}. \n(3) D2 suggests that Rokoman’s proposals were not intended to hide D1-2’s interests but \ninstead to comply with maximum related-party group borrowing thresholds. For the \nreasons given above, that is a false dichotomy. Rokoman sought to remove horizontal \nconnections between companies (in the form of shared directors / purported UBOs) \nin order to reduce the likely breaches of group debt ratios. She was only able to make \nthose proposals because all of the companies were ultimately owned and/or controlled \nby D1-2. And it was by hiding those horizontal links that, it was hoped, the NBU \nwould not discover the vertical connections to D1-2.  \n342 Accordingly, D2’s criticisms are misconceived and (as the Bank explained in Opening and \nin its D1/D2 Document Presentations) the Rokoman Spreadsheet and Updated Rokoman \nSpreadsheet constitute strong evidence that the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers \nwere under D1-2’s common control. \n(5) The IFRS Related Party Letters: D1-2’s lies to PwC and falsification of financial \nstatements \n343 D1-2 lied to PwC about their interests in the Borrowers, Intermediary Borrowers and other \ncompanies which borrowed funds from the Bank.

Those individuals’ contempt for \nthe Bank’s auditors (or perhaps auditors generally) is apparent in their laddish banter \nwhile planning a holiday together in 2015 {E7/36.1}. \n(3) The text of the IFRS Related Party Letters is broadly the same and demonstrates that \nD1-2 were well aware of the significance of the disclosures and the importance of \nthem being accurate (which, as we explain below, they were not). To take the 2014 \nletter as an example {E9/195.4L}: \n(a) D1-2 recognised that “ obtaining representations from us concerning the information \ncontained in this letter is a significant procedure in enabling you to form an opinion whether \nthe financial statements described above present fairly the financial position, results of \noperations and cash flows of the Bank…and accordingly, we make the following \nrepresentations, which are true to the best of our knowledge and belief ” (¶1). \n(b) D1-2 each acknowledged that “ parties are considered to be related if one party has the \nability to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making \nfinancial and operating decisions. In effect, this includes individuals owning directly or indirectly \nan interest in the voting power that gives them significant influence over the Group …” ( ¶2). \n(c) D1-2 each confirmed a list of related parties (“ we confirm that … presented Appendix \nA [is] a list of the Group’s related parties as at 31 December 2014 and for the year then \nended is full and comprehensive ”) and a list of unrelated parties (“ we confirm that entities \nlisted in Appendix B are not related to the Bank nor to the Bank’s management nor \nshareholders .”) (¶¶3, 4). \n(4) Appendix B contains a large number of companies which are, contrary to D1-2’s \nrepresentations, related to the Bank. For example: \nAA2/15/199\n193 (a) It was denied that Uniks was a related party {E9/195.4/22} (#464), contrary to \nD1-2’s admissions in these proceedings. (In addition, relatedness was – the Bank \nsays falsely – denied in relation to 24 further Borrowers: {AA6/12/10-11}.) \n(b) D1-2 denied that Celastrina was a related party {E9/195.4/12} (#26), but in \nAugust of the same year, this company wrote to the Bank to say that it was \ncontrolled by D1 {E5/157.2/21}. \n(c) D1-2 denied that DniproAzot was a related party {E9/195.4/15} (#160), but \nthey accept in these proceedings that DniproAzot (whose shares were pledged \npursuant to the Share Pledges) was “ owned (including holding an interest in favour of \nthird parties) and controlled ” by them in the period 1.4.13 to 30.9.14  {A1/17} (#3 \nand #5). \n(d) Derling and Ukrinterinvest are further companies whose shares were pledged, \nwhere ownership and control is admitted in these proceedings, but where \nrelated-party status was denied by D1-2: {E9/195.4/18} (no. 312) \n{E9/195.4/23} (496); {A1/17} (15 and 55) and {A1/17/2} (49-51). \n(e) Further examples are found in the Day 15 hand-up at {AA6/12}. \n344 Neither D1-D2 has attempted any explanation for their IFRS letter misrepresentations: there \nis none to give. D1-2 were telling barefaced lies to the auditors to conceal the scale and \nextent of the Bank’s related-party lending. Moreover, the fact that they were doing so at the \nsame time as the Luchaninov and Rokoman exercises further gives the lie to D2’s various \nattempts to explain away those episodes as unimportant regulatory reorganising. It is \nperfectly plain what D1-2 were doing: seeking to conceal their connections to the Borrowers \nand Intermediary Borrowers.  \nG6 UNANSWERED MATERIAL ON D1-2’ S OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF D3-8 \n345 The Court will have noted that Ds have failed to address any part of the extensive and \ndamning evidence showing their ownership and control "}

In particular:  \n(1) D1-2 have not offered an explanation for why Collyer (D5) appears in D2’s 2008 Asset \nList as holding their interests in a series of grain elevator companies {E1/29P/3}, \nBank Opening/¶329 {AA2/1/140}. \n(2) Nor have they sought to explain Trade Point Agro’s (D4) early use as a company in \ntheir ‘projects’: on 3.9.08, Kazantsev emailed Kryvko, a D1-2 nominee, stating: “ we \nwant a non-resident counter-party again for one of our companies ”, to which Kryvko replied: \nAA2/15/200\n194 “Can Trade Point Agro be used for this project? ZMGK already has a contract with them. ”182 \nDolmatov vetoed the use of Trade Point: “[ t]he company cannot be used in the scheme because \nit is audited ” {E1/33}. \n(3) D1 has offered no explanation for why Rossyn (D6) made an unsecured loan to Larisa \nChertok, D1’s sister, of at least €44.5 million (the balance said by their auditor, \nKyriakides, Savvides & Associates, based on Rossyn’s account balances, to have been \noutstanding in 2013) {E3/337/1}). \n(4) D1 and Teamtrend (D3) have not explained D1’s involvement in the Shahar \nProceedings:  \n(a) D1 and Sergei Cheklanov were the Claimants in one of the two actions making \nup the Shahar Proceedings; they sought a declaration against Michael Shahar \nthat Cheklanov was the beneficial owner of the one issued share in Teamtrend: \n{I3/56/2} ([2]).  \n(b) As Mann J observed “ At the heart of these two actions is a claim by Mr Shahar that [D1 \nand Cheklanov ] have conspired together, with others, to deprive him of the value of assets which \nhe held through Teamtrend. ”  {I3/56/2} ([2]) \n(c) Mann J observed that the “ corporate steps ” which are the “ subject of the first action ” \nin these proceedings ( i.e. “procuring Teamtrend to issue additional shares and by \nappointing additional people to be directors and company secretary of that company ”) were \ndone “ at the behest of Mr Cheklanov and Mr Kolomoisky ”: see {I3/56/2} ([2]-[3]). \nIndeed, Mann J explained that D1 and Cheklanov sought, by their claim, “ to \njustify the steps which were taken in relation to the corporate governance of Teamtrend .” (ibid.) \n(d) Mann J observed, at [16], that “ it is not wholly clear why [D1] is party to this action \nsince he does not seem to claim any relief .” When one understands D1’s asset holding \nstructures, the reason emerges: had the action gone further, it would have \nbecome obvious that Cheklanov was a nominee for (at least) D1.  \n(e) The assets supposedly owned by Teamtrend at the time of the Shahar \nProceedings ended up in D1-2’s joint ownership.183 \n \n182  ZMGK is a reference to Zaporozhye Oil and Fat Plant (sometimes referred to as ‘ZOFP’; in Russian, \n‘Запорожский масложиркомбинат’ or ‘ЗМЖК’), a company which appears in D2’s 2007 asset list at \n{E1/11P/7}. D1 and D2 are also identified as holding interests in ZMGK in 2014, via the company Meyerson \nUnited Ltd (BVI), in an attachment to the Luchaninov Email: see {E8/165/2}. \n183  D1-2 have each disclosed an interest in TDV TSUM (D1 U/R Asset 134 {J2/8/1}, D2 U/R Asset 146 \n{J4/5/153}) which the Bank understands to be the same asset ‘ZUM’ referred to at [7] in Shahar {I3/56/4}. \nAA2/15/201\n195 (f) The Bank has relied on the Shahar Proceedings since December 2017 (see \n¶26(b) of the original POC at {A1/1.1/14}). D1 avoided responding to the \nBank’s plea that he owned Teamtrend in 2004 (see D1Def/¶26 {A1/8/20}) \nand has failed to address it in nearly six years of evidence and submission.184 \n(5) D"}

D3-5 have not \nexplained their extraordinarily prompt attempt to defend their (non-existent) business \nreputations in October 2017, which stands in stark contrast to their lack of action in \nresponse to e.g. the Nashi Groshi articles in 2014: see Bank Opening/¶¶335-340 \n{AA2/1/141-143}. Indeed, they have been unable to produce a single document \ndemonstrating when and how they became aware of the ‘Law and Business’ articles, \ndespite a specific disclosure order directed to this topic: {A6/93/2} ( ¶2(c)). \n(7) D1, D4 and D6-8 have not offered an explanation for the overwhelming evidence that \nD1 procured D4 and D6-8 to bring proceedings to release account freezing orders \nobtained against them by the GPO (see Bank Opening/¶¶332-334 {AA2/1/141}, \n{Day16/10:2} - {Day16/15:17}). The timeline is instructive:  \nDate Event \n29.7.16 The Pechersky District Court grants injunctions on the application of the \nGPO by which it froze the Cyprus branch accounts of D4 and D6-8, as part \n \n184  See further Bank Opening/¶328 {AA2/1/140} and {Day1/112:6} - {Day1/116:5}. \n185  On 31.7.18, Primecap chased Sofocleous in relation to settlement of the invoices and Sofocleous reconfirmed \nthe correct payment details {E17/246.1}. On 13.8.18, Primecap emailed again regarding settlement of the \ninvoices, and resent them to Sofocleous {E17/246.2}. On 20.8.18, Sofocleous informed Primecap that the \ninvoices had been cancelled, with no written explanation {E17/246.3}. It is to be inferred that someone at \nPrimecap (or Sofocleous) realised that the invoices were embarrassing in that they showed Collyer and \nTeamtrend being controlled by D1 and D2. When that realisation occurred – notably, just after the Set Aside \nHearing before Fancourt J – someone set up a paper trail to seek to discredit the invoices by recording them \nas cancelled. \nAA2/15/202\n196 of a criminal investigation into the Unreturned Prepayments, which was still in \na preliminary phase. \n8.8.16 The GPO produced a document entitled ‘Certificate’, confirming that, in \nconnection with those criminal proceedings, the accounts of D4 and D6-8 had \nbeen frozen pursuant to court orders ({K5-B8/1}, {K5-B8/2}, {K5-B8/3}). \n9.8.16 D1 received a WhatsApp message from Granovsky which stated: “ Promptly \nprepare claims for Privat freezing orders to be revoked. 4 accounts and 1 pending ” {K5-\nA1/24/7}.

That application was determined in D7’s favour on 9.9.16. \nThe ruling in respect of the application records that the GPO did not attend \nthe hearing, although it was notified of it {E15/229.1/2}. (Applications were \nalso issued for D4, D6 and D8 on 5.9.16, and were determined on 13-16.9.16: \n{E15/212.02/1}, {E15/212.01/9}, {E15/278.1/4}). \n11.9.16 D1 messaged a journalist at ‘Economic Truth’, Sevgil Musayeva, to complain \nabout the way that she had described D3 in her reporting (as a “ subsidiary of \nPrivatBank ”) {K5-A1/43/4}. The article that D1 was referring to had been \npublished on 9.9.16, and reported that the GPO’s application for the freezing \norder against D3 had been denied {K5-A1/43/5}. \n(8) Similarly, D1 has offered no explanation for his involvement in 2018 with the GPO’s \nrequests for assistance from HMRC in proceedings involving D3-5: \n(a) On 5.11.18, an individual saved to D1’s phone as “ Mini Me ” (later identified as \nArtem Solonyk in correspondence) sent D1 a draft letter to be sent by the GPO \nto HMRC seeking international mutual legal assistance in respect of criminal \ninvestigations into D3-5:{K5-A1/56/3}. The draft letter {K5-B16/10} had a \nfilename starting with the words “ secret file ”: see the top entry in the chat. \n(b) The draft letter (along with other similar drafts sent at the same time) is preceded \nby a message from Solonyk stating “ Hello, can I send you new letters from your \nnamesake for adjustment and approval ?” {K5-A1/56/2}. On its face, this suggests \nthat D1 is being asked to comment on the text of the requests, having been \nprovided with them (via Solonyk) by a contact within the GPO. Unless D1 had \nan interest in D3-5 (and the other entities mentioned in this request, which \ncomprise a group of Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers alleged to have \n \n186  This email was disclosed only by D3-8, from SK Law’s records; it has not been disclosed from any of \nPrimecap’s records, whether by D3-8 or D1-2. A signed copy of the power of attorney has not been disclosed. \nAA2/15/203\n197 entered into contracts with D3-5), there is no plausible reason why he should \ninterfere with the GPO’s information requests of HMRC.  \n(c) Solonyk then reverted c. two hours later, at 1:48pm, stating “ Item 9 was removed, \nthat was what we wanted! ” {K5-A1/56/3}. It is unclear what this refers to \n(presumably it was the subject of oral discussion) but seems to suggest that D1 \nwas able successfully to influence the final contents of the requests. D1 does \nnot appear to put any of his instructions to Solonyk in writing: it is to be inferred \nthis was discussed orally to avoid creating any record. \n(9) D1-2 have offered no explanation for their close relationships with Kiperman and \nRomanovsky, the purported UBOs of D6 and D7 (Bank Opening/¶¶324-325 \n{AA2/1/137}). And, as explained in Section H , D1’s claim that the Kiperman family \nowned some of the Transferred Assets is clearly false. \n(10) D1-8 have offered no explanation for the true source of funding for D3-8’s legal fees \n(see Bank Opening/¶¶344-350 {AA2/1/144}).

But D2 was \nforced to reveal in September 2023 that he employed Melnyk via Sunaltezza at \na salary of only c. €7,500 per month. \n(b) Emmett Group, D3-5’s “ nominee shareholder ” (see McNeill12/¶2.11 {H4/30/6}) \nhas been identified as the source of c. £4m of D3-5’s funding. As a nominee it \nwas clearly not the ultimate source of that funding.188 During the course of trial, \nD1 unredacted an email which showed that Emmet Group was owned by \n \n187  This should not have been controversial and the Bank invited D3-8 to agree this document to avoid having to \nadd c. 80 notification letters and accompanying schedules, spanning a five-year period, to the trial bundle. That \nwas unsuccessful: “ Preparation of your client’s closing submissions is a task for you, not for us ”. The notification letters \nhave there been added to vol. L2 of the trial bundle . \n188  Emmet Group’s directors are also PBC employees: Yulia Burkhan in 2019 (see {K3-B/483L/2} and {K4-\nA/7/1} for her connections to D1-2) and Anna Topilina (see{E17/306.9/1} and {K3-C2/14/1}). \n{AA2/15/206}\n{AA2/21}\nAA2/15/204\n198 Hipolito Investments (Belize) which in turn was purportedly owned by Melnyk, \nYesipova, Ivlev, Pugach and Trykulych: see {E17/306.2L} (redacted), \n{E17/306.2.1} (unredacted). The Bank submitted at trial that these are \nindividuals of modest means (images of their registered addresses are at \n{AA6/1/2}), and we have already mentioned Melnyk’s salary. But Ivlev and \nYesipova too were D2’s employees with salaries of just c. €3,500 per month: \nSection B2 . \n(c) Sanderlyn and Versala were amongst D6-8’s generous litigation funders (until \ntheir connection to D1-2 was revealed, leading the Court to conclude that there \nwas prima facie  evidence to suggest that the funding ultimately came from D1-2, \nat which point the tap was abruptly turned off). These are companies whose \nbank balances were reported to D1 on a nearly daily basis by Markova, and \ndisclosure last week showed that their bank accounts were controlled by \nSunaltezza employees ({K8-E/5/3} {K8-B1/1} {K8-B3/1} {K8-B3/4}). \nAnd, again, the position has moved on since trial. It now turns out that Markova \ntoo was D2’s employee (again via Sunaltezza) when she was sending D1 these \ndaily updates: Section B2 . \n(12) D1-2 and D6-8 have offered no explanation for D6-8’s asset disclosure, consisting of \nvast sums of receivables, nearly all of which are overdue for repayment, and which are \napparently only recoverable by way of assignment to discharge a corresponding \nliability owed by D6-8 to a creditor (see Kyriakou/Affi2 {H4/17.1/2}; \nKonnaris/Affi2 {H4/17.2/2}; Thrasyvoulou/Affi2 {H4/17.3/2}).

The evidence \nis clear that D6-8 were involved in D1-2’s money laundering operations and were, in \nfact, D1-2 companies.  \n• • • \nH PURPORTED REPAYMENT OF RELEVANT LOANS (THE FACTS ) \nH1 INTRODUCTION  \n346 We have addressed the manner by which the Relevant Loans were purportedly repaid to the \nBank by way of Intermediary Loans, Asset Transfer and Transformation at Bank \nOpening/H/¶¶361-413 {AA2/1/150}. In outline: \n(1) Intermediary Loans. As explained in Section F , Ds have largely agreed that the loans \nissued by the Bank (including the Intermediary Loans) were granted “ contrary to all \nprinciples of prudent banking ” (D2 Opening/¶7 {AA4/1/7}) (D2 Opening/¶48 \n{AA4/1/22}). There has also been no meaningful response to the Bank’s case that \nthese purported loans were fraudulent and that the Intermediary Borrowers, like the \nBorrowers, were owned and controlled by D1-2 (see Section G ), save for the \naverment that they were part of a loan recycling scheme. In the circumstances, the \nBank says no more about the facts relating to the Intermediary Loans, and invites the \nCourt to conclude that the Intermediary Loans were fraudulent further sham lending \norchestrated by D1-2 to cover up the misappropriation of monies by the Relevant \nDrawdowns. \n(2) Asset Transfer. The Asset Transfer was addressed at {Day16/140:3} - \n{Day16/155:2}, {Day17/1:25} - {Day17/44:7}. The Bank’s case that D1-2 were \nheavily involved in the Asset Transfer is developed further in Section D and valuation \nissues are addressed in Section N . In Section H2 , we address the evidence of D1-2’s \nownership and control of the Transferred Assets in which they have denied interests \nand explain why D1-2 must have known about (and indeed given instructions in \nrelation to) the gross inflation of the values attributed to them. ( Section H3 addresses \nthe Bank’s position on Hotel Mir and the Aircraft.) \n(3) Transformation. D1’s pleaded case is that the NBU chose the New Borrowers and \ncaused the Bank to issue the New Loans and release the Share Pledges: D1Def/¶¶48, \n51-55 {A1/8/26}. That case was exposed at trial as baseless. It was unsupported by \nany evidence from D1. It was not put to the Bank’s witnesses: D1 failed to challenge \n{AA2/15/149}\n{AA2/15/178}\n{AA2/15/88}\n{AA2/15/422}\n{AA2/15/207}\n{AA2/15/217}\nAA2/15/206\n200 the Bank’s witnesses (Mr Shekmar, Ms Domashenko, Ms Rozhkova) who gave \nevidence that the NBU did nothing of the sort.

We address the Transformation briefly in Section H4 . \nH2 THE ASSET TRANSFER  \n(1) D1-2’s ownership of the Transferred Assets \n347 D1-2 have admitted ultimate beneficial ownership of many of the Transferred Assets but \n(curiously) denied ownership of others. As explained at {Day17/8:3} to {Day17/38:18} \nownership is denied in relation to ( i) the Aircraft, ( ii) one of the seven pieces of real estate, \n(iii) a relatively small proportion of the Petrol Stations,190 and ( iv) a greater proportion of the \nOSFs.191 Those denials are demonstrably false. \n348 Inherent improbability. It is inherently improbable that third parties would have transferred \ntheir assets to D1-2’s bank as part of the Asset Transfer; no reason why third parties would \nact in this manner has been advanced; no disclosure has been given to suggest that third \nparties were remunerated in some way for giving up their valuable assets; and no witness \nevidence has been called to support this inherently unlikely case.  \n349 Bank’s Financial Statements. D1-2’s denials are further undermined by the Bank’s 2015 \nfinancial statements (completed just after the first phase of the Asset Transfer: {K1/5/5}), \nwhich they approved. They said this (emphasis added): \n“… In addition, the Bank’s major shareholders, aiming to support the Bank’s compliance with \nthe regulatory requirements, contributed their own assets  in the form of repossessed \ncollateral to partially or fully settle loans issued to related and third parties. Negotiations on \ncollateral repossession with the Bank’s borrowers and the major shareholders commenced in \n2015 and were generally completed by the end of June 2016, when the Bank became the owner \nof the respective assets and recognised them at the fair value of approximately UAH 31,845 \nmillion in its balance sheet as repossessed collateral.” {K1/5/26} \n350 The Aircraft. The process by which the nine Aircraft were transferred to the Bank \ndemonstrates not only D1-2’s ownership of the same, but also that a crude attempt was \nmade to hide that ownership. In particular, as further explained below, within a matter of \ndays the Aircraft were ‘flipped’ from D1-2’s aircraft owning companies (Goiania, Penny \nLane, Teide) to a newly incorporated Belizean company (Perser), before being transferred \nto the Bank and onwards again to a Cypriot company called Dilorsano: see Appendix H1 . \n \n190  Majority interests are admitted by D1-2 in 180 of the 246 Petrol Stations.  \n191  Majority interests are admitted by D1-2 in 44 of the 74 OSFs.  \n{AA2/15/217}\n{AA2/22}\nAA2/15/207\n201 Whilst being ‘flipped’, the Aircraft continued to be leased by D1-2’s airlines (Windrose, \nUkraine International Airlines192 and Dniproavia193): \n(1) As we explain above, in early July 2016, the NBU complained to D1 that the assets so \nfar transferred under the Asset Transfer were very substantially overvalued. In \nresponse, D1 on 10.7.16 sent the NBU a list of additional assets which could be \ntransferred, including “ GOIANIA LDA (2 [6] aircraft: 15 Embraire 145; 2 Embraire 190; \n8 Boeing 737; 1 Boeing 768) … Penny Lane LTD (3 aircraft: 3 Boeing 767) ” {B4/1/36}.  \n(2) For reasons which are not entirely clear, Teide (the third company which owned the \nAircraft transferred to the Bank) was omitted from D1’s letter. But there can be no \ndoubt that all three companies (Goiania, Penny Lane, Teide) were owned by D1-2: \n(a) D1-2 admit that they owned and controlled each of Goiania, Penny Lane and \nTeide in 2013-4: {A1/17} (entries 2-9) {L/76.1}.  \n(b) Goiania and Penny Lane are disclosed assets of both D1 and D2 (see {J1/3/10-\n11"}
{"start": 563500, "text": "ft: 3 Boeing 767) ” {B4/1/36}.  \n(2) For reasons which are not entirely clear, Teide (the third company which owned the \nAircraft transferred to the Bank) was omitted from D1’s letter. But there can be no \ndoubt that all three companies (Goiania, Penny Lane, Teide) were owned by D1-2: \n(a) D1-2 admit that they owned and controlled each of Goiania, Penny Lane and \nTeide in 2013-4: {A1/17} (entries 2-9) {L/76.1}.  \n(b) Goiania and Penny Lane are disclosed assets of both D1 and D2 (see {J1/3/10-\n11} (D1) {J3/4/20-21} (D2)), whilst Teide is disclosed asset of D1 {J1/4/2}.  \n(c) Each company’s shares were pledged to the NBU (as described above). \n(d) The asset list produced by Primecap for D2 in September 2016 {E15/132.2/9} \n{E15/132.2M} lists all nine of the Aircraft as being held by Goiania, Teide and \nPennylane, with D2 recorded as having a 50% interest in each, notwithstanding \nthat this postdates their alleged transfer to the Bank.  \n(3) Between 10.06-10:21am on 22.8.16, the nine Aircraft appeared in the Bank’s \ntransactional data as having been transferred to the Bank with a Credit Value of \nUS$163m. By 12.06pm, the value of the nine Aircraft had been applied to reduce the \nrecorded balances of 10 loans (including seven Relevant Loans): see D1 RRFI 31.7.21 \nAnnex A {A2/28/132-133}.  \n(4) On 23.8.16: \n(a) At 11:14, an email was sent from a generic ‘Perser’ email address to the Bank’s \nCyprus branch. It attached formal documentation, showing that Perser is a \nBelizean company incorporated in March 2016: {E15/93}, {E15/94}.  \n \n192  D1 has disclosed a 24% interest {J2/3/26-27}.  \n193  D1 has disclosed a 9.05% interest {J2/3/44}, Dniproavia features in D2’s 2007 asset list {E1/11P/4}. \nAA2/15/208\n202 (b) At 12:18, a SK Law employee emailed signed bills of sale to Primecap, \nevidencing a transfer of the two Airbuses from Teide to Perser: {E15/103.1}, \n{E15/103.2/1-2}. (The purported sale agreements from Teide, Goiania and \nPennylane to Perser are listed in Bank Opening/¶387(2), fn. 323 \n{AA2/1/161}.) \n(c) At 14:25, the generic Perser address sent bills of sale to the Bank’s Cyprus \nbranch evidencing a transfer of certain aircraft from Perser to the Bank: \n{E15/99} {E15/102} {E15/103} (as set out above, the transfer itself had been \nrecorded in the Bank’s records the previous day). \n(5) The Aircraft were then immediately ‘sold’ by the Bank to Dilorsano (see bills of sale \ndated between 23.8.16 and 25.8.16 in Appendix H1  and the undated Dilorsano sale \nagreements at {K2-D/14} to {K2-D/22}). Those sale agreements represented a \nshockingly bad deal for the Bank. To take {K2-D/14} (the sale of Airbus MSN 2462) \nas an example of one of the nine Dilorsano SPAs: \n(a) The price payable for the MSN 2462 was US$28.8m with insignificant payments \nover a period of 120 months, with over 89% of the price payable in a final \n‘bullet’ payment of US$25.7m {K2-D/14/12}. \n(b) In the event Dilorsano fails to pay, clause 10.3.2 provides that the agreement \nmay be terminated and clause 10.6-10.7 provide that the Bank may sell the \nAircraft. Clause 10.8 then provides that “ if the proceeds as per clause 10.7 are not \nsufficient to cover any of the liabilities specified in clause 10.7 the Purchaser [Dilorsano ] shall \nnot stay liable towards the Seller [the Bank ] for such unpaid amounts and will be released \nfrom all and any obligations under the Agreement. ” {K2-D/14/8}. \n(c) As we set out in Section N , the Aircraft were all ageing in 2016, and the experts \nagreed that after c. 25 years an aircraft would have (at best) a residual or “part \nout” value.194 It was inevitable that, at the end of the 10 year period, Dilorsano \nwould not pay the bullet payments to the Bank. Indeed, the aggregate of the \nbullet payments provided for in the nine agreements was US$101m – more than \nthe true value of the nine Aircraft even on D1’s expert’s valuations.  \n \n194  See Seymour/¶6.8 {D14/1/14}; Razzhivinia {D13/11/2}  and see e.g. the graph at {D14/2/5} showing the \n"}

The Dilorsano \nPledge is at {K2-D/7}. It does not provide for Dilorsano to make good any \nshortfall from the sale of the Aircraft and the sums owed by Dilorsano to the \nBank under the Dilorsano SPA. \n(e) In the event, as at September 2021 Dilorsano had only paid US$13m of principal \nand US$40m of interest under the Dilorsano SPAs: Thompson2/¶¶6.15-6.17 \n{D1/347/75}. \n(f) As set out in Bank Opening/¶623, the Aircraft must now have a negligible value. \nEight of the Aircraft are currently at Airports in Ukraine; three have not flown \nfor three years; and none have flown since the war started.  \n(6) After the sale to Dilorsano, the Aircraft continued to be operated by D1-2’s \ncompanies. For example, the Airbus 2462 was operated by Windrose Airlines \n{D14/1/6} {K2-D/24} and D1 approved Windrose’s expenses and payments via \nWhatsApp (including payment requests relayed via Kamenchuk, the purported UBO \nof Windrose) before the Aircraft were transferred to the Bank: see {K5-A1/36/1}, \n{K5-A1/42/3}.  \n(7) Strikingly, on 4.10.16 (shortly after the Goiania/Penny Lane/Teide → Perser → Bank \n→ Dilorsano transfers), Melnikova sent D1 a WhatsApp message as follows:  \n“Igor Valeryevich, Roza Vetrov [ sc. Windrose] as of 04.09.2016 (in UAH million): \nRevenues: 10.8 (current); Expenses: 0.2 (current). Funds deposited in account: - as of \n01.10.2016: 23.0; - as of 04.10.2016: 33.6 The payments on previous received bills of \nacceptance (DILORSANO/ aka Teide)  were prepared for 7.1. Issued payments for the \nequivalent of UAH 14.8 million, including: 1) 7.4 – flights and maintenance, of which – \n2.5 – fuel UTN, p/o; - 2.3 – a/port service” {K5-A1/42/4} (emphasis added) \n(8) D1 continued to receive information about Dilorsano by WhatsApp from Novikov \n(on 15.6.18 {K5-A1/50/63}) and Markova (on e.g. 1.8.19 {K5-A1/40/36}).  \n(9) D1 eventually clarified that his case is that the UBO of the Aircraft immediately prior \nto their transfer to the Bank was Victor Shkindel: {A2/29/8} (and note that the initial \n“TBC” plea has been struck through). But, on 26.9.16, Shkindel was also identified by \nPrimecap as the UBO of the ultimate transferor, Dilorsano (having taken over from a \nknown D1-2 nominee, Olena Kravchenko195): see {E15/251.1}, {E15/251.2L}. It is \nabsurd to suppose that, within the space of three weeks, Shkindel genuinely purchased \nthe nine Aircraft from D1-2’s companies (Goiania, Pennylane, Teide); sold the \n \n195  See her Nominee Chart at {K4-A/16}.  \nAA2/15/210\n204 Aircraft to the Bank; and then re-purchased them by acquiring Dilorsano from \nKravchenko. \n(10) In any event, it is clear Shkindel was never the true owner of the aircraft and instead \nwas at all times a D1-2 nominee: ( i) he was the acting chairman of Dniproavia \n{E15/309.1.4} (a company in which D1 has disclosed an interest {J2/3/44}); ( ii) he \nwas a director of Dnipro International Airport (which, in the Shahar Proceedings, D3 \nwas said to have a contract to run {I3/56/4} (¶¶7-8)); ( iii) he had an ‘Oil Ukraine’ \nemail address {E15/309.1.4}; ( iv) he was on the ‘Black’ {K5-E/3.1/6} {K5-\nE/2.1/5}; and ( v) his income was supposedly a meagre UAH 1,600 per month (see \n{E15/309.1.9}).  \n351 Dnipro Office/Okeanmash.

D1-2 eventually contended that they had no interest in the \nDnipro Office (also referred to in D1’s RRFI as the ‘Okeanmash’ office and transferred by \nOkeanmash LLC), which they contend was owned by Petro Klymenko {A2/29/3} (and \nagain note the initial “ TBC” pleading). Klymenko was clearly not the owner of the office:  \n(1) He was a (nominee) director of Paradiz (a Borrower) {K3-C1/271} and Chairman of \nthe Management Board of PJSC Ingosstrakh, an insurance company in which D1-2 \nhave or had interests;196  \n(2) Other ‘Okeanmash’ companies were identified as owned by D1-2 (see e.g. {E12/34}, \n{E12/35P} and D2’s asset list at {E15/132.2/18}); and  \n(3) D1 obtained documents from Okeanmash LLC for the purposes of disclosure (see \n{L/92.05/11}, entry 350, under the heading “ Custodians which have provided documents ”).  \n352 The Petrol Stations and OSFs. D1 claims that the Kiperman family were the UBOs of those \nOSFs and Petrol Stations in which he contends he has no interest. But as set out in Bank \nOpening/¶325 {AA2/1/138}, the Kiperman family acted as nominee owners for D1-2. \nNotably:   \n(1) Mikhail Kiperman required D1’s approval to make payments (which approval was \nsought by WhatsApp via Chmona and others, see e.g. on 15.6.15 {K5-A1/11/3});   \n(2) Mikhail Kiperman had extensions on the ‘Black’ {K5-E/2.1/1-2} {K5-E/3.1/2} and \nwas responsible for setting up the network itself (see Elliss5/¶78 {H3/22/14}); \n \n196  See POC/¶19(g.1) {A1/2/12}; D1Def/¶20(9A)(c) {A1/8/18}; D2Def/¶31(6A)(c) {A1/18/16}; \n{E17/270.3/1}. \nAA2/15/211\n205 (3) The Kiperman family had long-standing relationships with D1 and D2 (see the profile \nof Yuri Kiperman at {E15/89.1} (pp. 5, 17197, 18, 32)); \n(4) D1 offered supposedly Kiperman-owned petrol stations to the NBU (see D1’s \nWhatsApp to Ms Rozhkova on 16.8.16: “ if the aforesaid petrol filling stations fail, we will \nreplace them with other ones ” {K5-A1/54/3} – the attachment at {K5-B15/3} includes \npetrol stations which D1 contends were supposedly owned by the Kipermans (see, \nfor example, entries 43 and 49 ( c.f. {A2/31.6/3} (tranche 17.3) {A2/29/5} (tranche \n23.5)); \n(5) Chernyshov and Plyska’s Skype exchange in March 2015 demonstrated how D1’s \norders were carried out by Novikov in respect of assets nominally owned by the \nKipermans: \nPlyska “Artem, what for did you leave joint-stock companies among the most expensive?  … \nadjust the list, the JSC should not be on it!!! ” \nChernyshev  “OK …maybe at the same time we should remove the subsidiary Optima-770-Ch \nand the subsidiary Optima-770-R …” \nPlyska “Why? ” \nChernyshev  “because of the owner ” \nPlyska “Kiperman? ” \nChernyshev  “Yeah … I think there may be problems with signing ” \nPlyska “There should be no problem there, TYu [sc. Novikov ] will push it through ” \nPlyska  “This is an order from IVK, so no one will resist there ” [emphasis \nadded] \nSkype chat between Plyska and Chernyshov on 27.3.15 {K6/70.1/2-4}  \n(6) D1 originally pleaded that the Kipermans were the UBOs of c. 32 OSFs transferred in \ntranches 2.3, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.11. Following an RFI from the Bank, D1 was forced to \namend his pleadings to accept that he and D2 had 90% interests in these OSFs (with \nIgor Palytsia’s family holding a minority 10% interest).198 Interestingly, and as with the \n \n197  This shows D2 pictured with Yuri Kiperman with the board of trustees of the Dnipropetrovsk Jewish \nCommunity. \n198  Re-Amended Annex B to D1 RRFI 30.7.21{A2/29}.

As explained in D1 Composite RRFI 21.12.22/¶¶25-31 \n{A2/31.8/17}, the underlying basis for that concession was D1’s acceptance that the OSFs in tranches 2 – 5 \nhad all been pledged by, and transferred to the Bank by, the “Original Mortgagors”  (i.e. the companies which \noriginally transferred these OSFs to the Bank, before the mortgage agreements were amended to replace the \nOriginal Mortgagors with the Asset Transferors). On that basis, D1 was forced to identify the Original \nMortgagors of these OSFs, such as TF Zaporizhnaftoproduct LLC and Pirsan LLC, both of which are \ncompanies owned by D1-2 (with a supposed minority interest in favour of the Palytsia family). Despite the \namendments and clarifications, there remains an inconsistency between D1 RRFI 31.7.21 Re-Amended Annex \nB {A2/29} and D1 Composite RRFI ¶¶33-34 {A2/31.8/19} as to D1-2 / the Kiperman family’s interests in \nthe OSFs transferred in these tranches.  \nAA2/15/212\n206 Aircraft, there was a hastily arranged transfer of title to these OSFs immediately before \ntheir transfer to the Bank. \n353 By way of specific example, D1 denies any interest in the 28 Petrol Stations transferred to \nthe Bank by Frontlight Media LLC (tranches 17.3 (12 Petrol Stations), 25.1 (1), 30.1 (1), 26.1 \n(1): see e.g. {A2/31.6/2-3}) and VK Amarant LLC (tranches 23.4 (8 Petrol Stations) and \n23.5 (5): see, e.g., {A2/31.6/5}). In both cases D1 claims that the Kiperman family were the \n100% UBOs of the Petrol Stations. As to that:  \n(1) Frontlight Media: ( i) on 21.7.16 , Chernyshov created a spreadsheet showing the \noriginal owners of the Petrol Stations and their proposed “ new owners ”, which showed \nFrontlight Media as the proposed “ new owner ” of petrol stations owned by Novel Estate \nLLC {K2-F/50P/5};199 (ii) also on 21.7.16 , PBC emailed Primecap with draft \nresolutions by which Novel Estate would make in-kind contributions of the 15 Petrol \nStations to the share capital of Frontlight {E15/9.1} {E15/9.3} (Primecap forwarded \nthem to Tsitsekkos for execution the same day: {E15/10.1L} {E15/10.4});  (iii) the \nshareholders in Novel Estate (which, as a result of the contribution of the Petrol \nStations to Frontlight’s share capital, became a 99% shareholder in Frontlight) are all \ncompanies that appear in D1-2’s asset disclosure;200 (iv) between 1.8.16  and 12.9.16 , \nFrontlight transferred 15 Petrol Stations to the Bank; and ( v) when there was a \nproblem in relation to one Petrol Station transferred by Frontlight (at 98A \nBrodovskaya Street), the issue was discussed and resolved between PBC and the Bank \n(see the Skype chat at {K6/99/4}: “ I’ll talk to Melnik ”). There is not a single \ncommunication to/from the Kipermans relating to the transfer of these purportedly \nKiperman-owned Petrol Stations to the Bank. \n(2) VK Amarant : ( i) Chernyshov’s 21.7.16 table shows VK Amarant as the “ new owner ” \nof petrol stations belonging to Yumoni and Cherkassy-Oil-2008 {K2-F/50P/8}; ( ii) \nD2 has admitted a 40-45% interest in Cherkassy-Oil-2008 {J4/5/48}, {I3/39/20}; \n(iii) D1’s Tatneft asset disclosure has shown that he too disclosed a 37% interest in \nCherkassy-Oil-2008 (a disclosure that only belatedly became apparent after D1’s \nsolicitors were forced to remove unjustified redactions to the asset list {I3/39.11}); \nand ( iv) D2 admitted in the Tatneft Proceedings that he had a 15% interest in VK \n \n199  On 26.7.16, a more advanced version of the spreadsheet was sent by Shvetsova to Melnyk and Oil Ukraine \nwhich showed the Novel Estate / Frontlight Media Petrol Stations to be used to repay Alfatrader’s loans: see \n{E15/26} {E15/27P/6}.  \n200"}

On \n5.8.21 the Bank asked D2 to confirm whether he agreed with D1’s position {L/11.6}. The \nBank chased D2 on 20.1.22 {L/34.1}, 3.2.22 {L/42.1}, and 16.2.2 {L/45.2} but did not \nreceive any proper response, and so it applied to the Court on 4.3.22 for an order that D2 \nprovide the requested confirmation {G1/67}. On 25.3.22, the Bank agreed that it would \nnot pursue its application on the condition that D2 would provide the requested \nconfirmation or explain why he was unable to do so by 29.4.22  {L/69.002}. The Bank \nrepeatedly chased D2 for his response (on 4.5.22 {L/69.3}, 13.5.22 {L/71.04.01}, 18.5.22 \nand 1.6.22 {L/73.1}). \n355 Finally, on 22.6.22 (almost a year after the Bank had first asked), Enyo wrote to say that D2 \n“has not been able to verify ” the extent of his beneficial ownership in the RLTAs but was content \nto proceed on the basis that his interests in those assets were as set out in the D1 RRFI \n30.7.21 Annex B {L/76.1}.  \n356 That was a lie. D2 is able to verify his interests in the RLTAs but elected not to do so: \n(1) On 5.9.16, D2 gave his detailed asset disclosure in the Tatneft Proceedings {I3/38}, \n{I3/39}. He explained that the information was correct “ as at 12 August 2016 ” and \nthat the values ascribed to the assets “ are correct as between 19 August 2016 and 2 September \n2016 ” {I3/38/3} (¶¶6, 13). The D2 Tatneft Asset List sets out D2’s interest in many \nof the Asset Transferors – in many cases, D2’s percentage shareholding is given to \nfour decimal places and valued to the cent. For example, D2’s interests in Ukr-Prom-\nTrade (a Transferor of OSFs) and Citi Commerts (a Transferor of Petrol Stations) \nwere described thus {I3/39/29}: \nAA2/15/214\n208 (2) In certain instances, the D2 Tatneft Asset List identifies D2 as having an interest in \nAsset Transferors where D1 has asserted in his pleading that the assets transferred by \nthat Transferor were owned by the Kiperman family outright. For example:  \n(a) D1’s RRFI 30.7.21 Annex B says that the Petrol Stations transferred to the Bank \nby VK Amarant were 100% owned by the Kiperman family (see above). But the \nD2 Tatneft Asset List says that he had a 15.5545% interest in VK Amarant as \nat 12.8.16 {I3/39/28}. (VK Amarant transferred its first Petrol Stations to the \nBank just six days later, on 18.8.16.) \n(b) D1 RRFI 30.7.21 Annex B originally stated that the Kiperman family were the \n100% UBOs of the OSFs transferred by Ukr-Prom-Trade (see above). But D2’s \nTatneft Asset List identifies D2 as holding a 29.7270% interest in Ukr-Prom-\nTrade as at 12.8.16 {I3/39/29}. \n(c) D2’s abandoned evidence in these proceeding is that he did not know much \nabout the detail of the Asset Transfer (“ I do not know the details of what was discussed \nor how the assets to be transferred were identified …”201). That is not consistent with \nD2’s ability in September 2016 to list his interests in many of the Asset \nTransferors "}

That is not consistent with \nD2’s ability in September 2016 to list his interests in many of the Asset \nTransferors (to four decimal places) and to value those interests to the cent. \n(3) Knowledge of inflated Credit Values \n357 The Bank’s case is that D1-2 knew that the Credit Values of the Transferred Assets used in \nthe 2016 Mortgages had been inflated: \n(1) Most obviously, these were D1 and D2’s assets. They simply must have known what \nthey were worth, and they have eschewed the opportunity to tell the Court on what \nbasis they could say they did not. That is particularly so in circumstances in which D1-\n2 were subject to the Tatneft freezing order in March 2016 which required them to \ndisclose their assets together with estimates of their value. \n(2) D1’s own valuation experts value the Airfield at less than 10% of its Credit Value, the \nOSFs at about 40% of their Credit Value, and the Aircraft and Training Centre at \nabout 50% of their Credit Values. The Bank’s experts say that even these valuations \nare far too generous and that, overall, the Transferred Assets were overvalued by \n \n201  Bogolyubov4/¶118 {B2/11/29}.  \nAA2/15/215\n209 c. 80%. The vast difference between the valuation figures given to the NBU and the \ntrue values shows that this cannot be a case of reasonable professional disagreement.  \n(3) Particular examples can be given. Pennylane’s accounts to 31.12.15 showed that it \nowned six Boeing 767s with an average age of 23 years and a combined value of \nUS$74m,202 or an average value of c. $12m: {E17/8.1/4} {E17/8.1/7} {E17/8.1/17-\n18}. But when two of those aircraft were transferred for a combined US$58m ({K2-\nD/17/1} (1992, MSN 25533), {K2-D/18/1} (1993, MSN 25536). D1-2 had extensive \ninterests in aircraft-owning companies. It is to be inferred that they knew that two c. \n23-year-old Boeing 767s were worth nowhere near US$58m (indeed, the same \nPennylane accounts state that the “ useful life ” of an aircraft was up to 30 years \n{E17/8.1/12}).  \n(4) D1 was warned that the NBU had spotted that the OSFs and real estate had been \ntransferred at unsupported values at his meeting on 7.7.16 {E14/309.1}, \n{E14/309.2}; D2 was warned that certain real estate assets had been overvalued such \nthat tax liabilities would arise (see {E14/303.2}); and the overvaluation of Hotel Zirka \nand the Dnipro Office was so egregious that the Bank was forced to reduce their \nvalues by UAH 1.9bn (55%) and UAH 212m (53%) respectively (US$77m and \nUS$9m) in August and September 2016 ( i.e. even prior to nationalisation).203 \n(5) D1 was involved in the detail of the Asset Transfer (see e.g. his messages to Ms \nRozhkova {K5-A1/54/1}; {K5-A1/54/3}). His attention to detail is unsurprising: he \nwas a micro-manager (see Section C  above) and he had recent personal experience of \ndirecting the use of his OSF network to hold stolen oil from Ukrtransnafta (see \nKolomoisky1/¶55(b) {H2/1/11}). It is to be inferred that he knew which OSFs were \nworking and which were not. D2 had plainly directed Anischenko and Marangos to \nwork together to transfer OSFs and Petrol Stations from his trusts to the Bank (and \nhe met Marangos in London twice in early 2016 – it is to be inferred to discuss the \nsame204). \n(6) The transfer of the assets – and their valuation – was handled by Primecap, PBC, the \nBank and Oil Ukraine. D1 approved the payment of Oil Ukraine’s expenses (see {K5-\n \n202  Property, plant and Equipment (US$54m) plus assets held for sale (US$20m) = US$74m.  \n203  See “ reversal of postings ” for Hotel Zirka at {A2/28/44} and “[ c]orrectional posting ” for the Dnipro "}

It is to be inferred \nthat they were acting on D1 and D2’s direct or indirect (via Gurieva, Novikov or \nDubilet) instructions in doing so. \nH3 HOTEL MIR AND THE AIRCRAFT  \n358 The Bank explained its position in relation to these assets in Bank Opening/¶¶615-623 \n{AA2/1/240}. Briefly:  \n359 Hotel Mir. the Bank has lost title to Hotel Mir in proceedings in Ukraine brought by \ncompanies owned and controlled by D1-2 such that its loss is not reduced by reference to \nit. Further or alternatively, it would be an abuse of rights for D1-2 to seek to reduce the \nBank’s loss in these proceedings by reference to Hotel Mir having recovered that asset for \nthemselves in Ukraine.  \n360 Aircraft. The Bank’s primary position is that its loss is only reduced by reference to the  c. \nUS$13m payments of principal made by Dilorsano in respect of the Aircraft, rather than the \ntrue value of those Aircraft. We explain the collusive and wholly uncommercial \narrangements between the Bank and Dilorsano at Section H  above.  \nH4 THE TRANSFORMATION  \n(1) D1’s pleaded case and the unchallenged evidence \n361 D1’s pleaded case consists of a series of lies which he has not even attempted to support at \ntrial either by way of evidence, cross-examination or submission: \n{AA2/15/149}\n{AA2/15/206}\nAA2/15/217\n211 D1’s pleaded case The Bank’s unchallenged evidence \n“48.

As to that:  \n(1) The NBU did not cause the Bank to issue the New Loans or to use the funds under \nthose loans to repay the 193 borrowers’ loans: see the Bank’s witness evidence above. \n(2) The Share Pledges were not discharged as a “ consequence ” of repayment of the 193 \nborrowers’ loans. They were the subject of termination agreements signed by the Share \nPledgor and the Bank. \n(3) Mr Shekmar explains in his unchallenged evidence that he discussed the issue of \nsecurity for the New Loans with Yatsenko at a meeting on 1.11.16 but the Bank failed \nto put in place any proper security for the New Loans, and that he and his team had \nno role in that decision: Shekmar/¶¶58-61 {B1/12/18}. As set out in Section F , it \nwas Primecap which organised the release of the existing Share Pledges and it was \n{AA2/15/149}\nAA2/15/218\n212 Bank employees who lied to EY about replacement share pledges being delayed as a \nresult of “ delays in transporting documents ” (i.e. the cheque was very much not in the post): \n{E16/179/116 }. \n(2) The documents  \n363 The Bank’s hand-up on Day 1 {AA6/1/11} shows the timing and manner in which the \nBank issued the New Loans over the course of 20.10.16 – c. 24.11.16. We draw attention to \nthe following features of that timeline:  \n(1) On 20.10.16, the first UAH 20bn in New Loans was issued. Those New Loans were \ngranted to five New Borrowers and were used to repay the outstanding loans of \nBorrowers (and no non-relevant borrowers). It is striking that the first part of the \nTransformation was directed at clearing the Borrowers’ indebtedness in this way. \n(2) The Transformation itself was directed from the highest levels within the Bank. On \n19.10.16, Yatsenko asked Dubilet to approve the terms of the New Loans (Yatsenko \nproposed 7-10 year terms with the principal repayable in equal parts starting in year 2 \n{E16/23.2}) and on the same day Kazantsev sent the first (surviving) draft of the \nTransformation Plan to various individuals: {E16/24}, {E16/25P}.

There are no \nsurviving instructions showing senior Bank employees directing Kazantsev to draw \nup the plan: it is to be inferred that the instructions came from D1-2 via Dubilet, \nNovikov, Yatsenko and/or Gurieva. This first draft plan included 44 of the \nBorrowers, and showed their debts to be repaid by five New Borrowers. A further \ndraft was sent to ‘Oil Ukraine’ the following day: see {E16/30}, {E16/31P}. \n(3) The first five New Loans, issued on 20.10.16, were granted to Borand Trade \n{F1/128}, Business Prom Innovatsiya {F1/130}, Dream Company {F1/134}, \nKhromia {F1/141} and Like City {F1/145}. They had been approved by the ECC \nthe previous day: the attendees included Gurieva, Novikov, Pikush, Chmona and \nYatsenko. But it was not until 25.10.16, having learned about those loans, that the \nNBU requested the credit files of these five New Borrowers {E16/47}. Clearly, the \nNBU was not pre-approving the New Borrowers or the New Loans. \n(4) Later versions of the Transformation Plan ( e.g. that prepared on 15.11.16 {E16/128} \nand {E16/129}) included details of proposed share pledges in the ‘Collateral / \nAA2/15/219\n213 Security’ column. The clear implication was that the New Loans would be secured by \nnew share pledges. Those pledges had been drafted205 but were never executed. \n(5) The NBU did not select which ‘old’ borrowers’ loans were repaid. For example, on \n22.11.16, Mr Shekmar wrote to Dubilet to ask why two ‘old’ borrowers, Biotreyd and \nBiola Kompaniya, had been included in the Transformation {E16/154}. On 28.11.16 \n(five days after the final New Loan was issued) the Bank responded  to say that those \ncompanies were added “ due to the entire current loan portfolio restructuring. Today we are \nproviding the updated loan debt restructuring plan, which is in the final stage ” {E16/213}. \n(6) On 22.11.16, the EY Report was issued and included an analysis of the \nTransformation. It is clear EY were told a series of lies by the Bank’s senior \nmanagement about the Transformation and the New Borrowers:  \n(a) EY identified that the New Borrowers had no existing income streams (their \nprojected income based on results to Q3 2016 was UAH 13 million, whereas \nthe Bank forecast their income as UAH 70 billion p.a.: {E16/179/26}).  \n(b) The Bank told EY that the New Borrowers “ will increase business by purchasing sales \nturnover from other companies, including those in which the state holds an interest or stake ” \n{E16/179/4} and “ are expected to take over the business from other companies (the ‘donor \ncompanies’) owned by the ultimate beneficial owners of the new borrowers ”: {E16/179/99}. \nThe ‘donor companies’ were then identified as companies in which D1-2 held \nsignificant interests (such that the reference to the donor companies being in \ncommon ownership with the New Borrowers constitutes conclusive evidence \nthat D1-2 – despite their denials – owned the New Borrowers), but “ the Bank \ndid not reply to our question as to which instruments will be used to transfer revenues to new \nborrowers ” {E16/179/106}. \n(c) As set out above, EY were told, implausibly, that the reason no replacement \nshare pledges had been executed was delays in transporting documents. \n(7) It is clear that D1-2 could have issued new loans to the ‘donor companies’ directly \n(the Ferroalloy Holding companies, Dniproazot, Ukrnafta, Ukrtatnafta, etc.) – i.e. the \nreal companies with real incomes as promised by the October personal guarantee \n \n205  See: {E16/36.1} (draft pledge by Renalda of shares in Kievguma to secure New Loan to Like City); \n{E16/36.2} (draft pledge by Velitas of shares in Stalmag to secure New Loan to Dream Company); \n{E16/36.3} (draft pledge by Fe"}

They \ninstead chose to use worthless shells.  \n(8) On 8.12.16, Koryak reported to Gurieva that “ there are 30-40 new borrowers who the \ninspectors have already classified as defaulted pursuant to NBU Order N [o.] 351 (ultimate \nbeneficiaries unknown, borrowers have little revenue, borrowers have too few staff, etc.) ” \n{E17/23/1}; and, on 9.12.16, Mr Luchaninov reported (in an email forwarded to \nGurieva, Pikush and others) that he expected Mr Shekmar to raise issues in a meeting \nthe following day including “ non-transparent ownership structure; lack of company cash flows; \n[and] small staff sizes ” {E17/31}. Clearly, the NBU had not approved these New \nBorrowers in October. \n(3) The terms of the New Loans \n364 An example of a New Loan is at {F111/24/1} (UAH 4.3bn loan to Like City). It was \nrepayable in instalments between October 2018 and October 2024,206 with interest at 10.5% \np.a., payable quarterly. All of the New Loans were issued in UAH. \n365 D1 suggested to Ms Rozhkova and Mr Oleksiyenko that the Bank was better off as a result \nof the New Loans because it was no longer exposed to the depreciation of the hryvnia \nagainst the US dollar (see Rozkhova XX {Day8/122:4-9}, {Day8/129:14-19}; Oleksiyenko \nXX {Day11/51:16-19}). Plainly it is not the case that the Bank’s currency position is \nimproved by converting its assets ( sc. its loan receivables) from a stable currency (US dollars) \ninto a depreciating currency (UAH). Indeed, as addressed further in Section O  below, the \nTransformation also opened up a huge gap in the Bank’s assets / liabilities in US dollars \n{K1/6/63}: \n \n206  Bank Opening/¶411 stated that the New Loans were repayable in a single tranche after 10 years. That was not \nthe case. \n{AA2/15/491}\nAA2/15/221\n215 366 Put simply, if the Bank’s depositors had chosen to recall their US dollar deposits, the Bank \nwould not have been able to finance the payments from its own US dollar assets. It would \nhave been required to purchase US dollars on the open market, using its hryvnia resources \nto do so (see Davidson XX {Day25/149:8-16}). In circumstances in which the hryvnia was \ndepreciating, that was a perilous position for the Bank. By contrast, it was an excellent \nposition for D1-2 as the owners and controllers of the New Borrowers: the value in US \ndollar terms of their purported indebtedness was continually reduced as the depreciation of \nthe hryvnia continued.207 \n• • • \nI UKRAINIAN LAW OF TORT AND INVALIDITY OF CONTRACT  \nI1 OVERVIEW  \n367 This section considers the Ukrainian law principles applicable to ( i) claims in tort; and ( ii) \nthe invalidity of contracts.

{"start": 598500, "text": ", below, we address the Ukrainian \nlaw of:  \n(1) Unjust enrichment (relevant to the Bank’s claims against D3-8)  \n(2) Limitation and venire contra factum proprium  (raised by Ds as defences to the Bank’s \nclaims against them); and  \n(3) Currency and  interest is addressed in Sections O and P .  \n368 The Court has a very substantial volume of Ukrainian law evidence before it, in the form of \n16 trial expert reports, one Joint Report, 6½ days of oral evidence, and original source \nmaterial. In cutting through the forest of material – and mindful, post-Brownlie, of the \nflexibility afforded to the Court in assessing the content of foreign law208 – the Bank \nrespectfully suggests that the Court is likely to derive substantial assistance from starting \nwith the plain wording of the Civil Code ( “CC” ) and other statutory provisions themselves, \ncoupled with the decisions of the Supreme Court (and, in particular, its Grand Chamber – \nwhose judgments, it is agreed, “ carry more weight ”209) interpreting and applying them. In doing \nso, the Court should be wary of the approach D1 has adopted in his analysis of Ukrainian \n \n207  The exchange rate dropped from 1:27 on 31.12.16 to 1:36 on 31.12.22 (Davidson3/¶2.32 {D2/20/24}).

Indeed, even Mr Alyoshin \nacknowledged in XX that “ the Ukrainian jurisprudence is something which is very rapidly evolving ” \n{Day31/9:15-17}. \nI2 UKRAINIAN LAW OF TORT  \n(1) Overview  \n369 The Bank’s claim in tort is brought under Art. 1166 CC {C1/6/11}. It states: \n“Article 1166. General grounds for liability for property damage  \n1. Property harm caused by unlawful decisions, actions or omissions to the personal non- \nproperty rights of a natural or legal person, as well as harm caused to the property of a natural \nor legal person, shall be compensated in full by the person who caused the harm.  \n2. The person who caused the harm shall be exempt from paying compensation for the harm \nif he proves that the harm was caused not through his fault.  \n3. Any damage caused by any severe injury or any other personal injury or death of an \nindividual as a result of acts of God must be compensated to the extent provided by law.  \n4. Harm caused by lawful actions shall be compensated in the instances provided by the Civil \nCode of Ukraine or other law.”  \n370 As is common ground between the experts, the elements of a claim under Art. 1166 are thus: \n(i) unlawful conduct; ( i) harm; ( iii) causation; and ( iv) fault: UkrJR/¶22.1 {C5/1/13}. \n(2) The first element: unlawful conduct \n371 The concept of ‘unlawfulness’ is interpreted broadly as "}

Mr Beketov and Mr Alyoshin agree that “ a defendant’s \nconduct can be deemed unlawful if it breaches any provision of the Ukrainian Constitution, laws (statutes), \n \n210  D1 Opening/¶¶114-115 {AA3/1/37}; {Day6/131:9} - {Day6/132:6}. \n{AA2/15/8}\nAA2/15/223\n217 international treaties, executive orders, regulatory instruments or court judgments that is directly applicable \nto the defendant and expressly or implicitly prohibits the alleged conduct ”: UkrJR/¶26.2 {C5/1/14}. \n372 As against D1-2 specifically, the Bank’s case is that they breached the so-called fiduciary \nduties owed by them, as executives/officers of the Bank, under Art. 63 of the JSC Law, Art. \n43 of the Law on Banks and Art. 92(3) CC: POC ¶51 {A1/2/29}. \n373 The Bank also contends that each of D1-8 breached the rules prohibiting ( i) deprivation of \nownership, pursuant to Art. 3(1)(2) CC; and ( ii) abuse of rights, pursuant to Art. 13(2)-(3) \nCC: POC/¶51 {A1/2/29} and ¶54 {A1/2/31}. \n374 The content and scope of these duties as a matter of law is considered immediately below. \nTheir application to the facts of the case is addressed in Section J (in relation to D1-2) and \nSection K  (in relation to D3-8) below.  \n(a) Breach of fiduciary duties  \n(i) The fiduciary duties \n375 The fiduciary duties are as follows: \n376 First, Art. 63 of the JSC Law {C1/22/7} states: \n“Article 63 . Liability of officers of a joint stock company’s bodies  \n1. Officers of a joint stock company’s bodies shall act in the interests of the company, follow \nthe requirements of the law, provisions of the charter and other documents of the company.  \n2. Officers of a joint stock company’s bodies are liable to the company for losses caused to \nthe company by their actions (omissions) in accordance with the law.  \n3. In the event that several persons are liable in accordance with this article, their liability to \nthe company shall be joint and several.”  \n377 Secondly, Art. 43 of the Law on Banks {C1/23/6} states:  \n“Article 43 . Duty to protect the bank’s interests  \nThe executives of a bank are obligated to act for the benefit of the bank and its clients and \nare obligated to place the interests of the bank above their own when performing their \nobligations in accordance with the requirements of this Law.  \nIn particular, the bank’s executives are required: \n1) to behave responsibly when performing the duties of their office;  \n2) to take decisions within the bounds of the powers given to them;  \n3) to refrain from using their office in their personal interests;  \n4) to secure the integrity and transfer of the bank’s property and documents when directors \nare dismissed from their office.” \n378 Thirdly, Art. 42 of the Law on Banks, in force from 10.1.15 {C1/23/6}, states:  \n{AA2/15/276}\n{AA2/15/285}\nAA2/15/224\n218 “The executives of a bank are obligated to act in the bank’s interests and to observe the \nrequirements of the law, the provisions of the bank’s charter and other documents of the \nbank.” \n379 Fourthly, Art. 92(3) CC {C1/6/3} states: \n“Article 92 . Civil capacity of a legal entity \n \n1. A legal entity acquires civil rights and obligations and exercises them through its bodies \nacting in accordance with its constitutional documents and the law.  \nThe bodies of a legal entity shall be set up in the manner prescribed by its constitutional \ndocuments and the law. \n  \n2.

A legal entity acquires civil rights and obligations and exercises them through its bodies \nacting in accordance with its constitutional documents and the law.  \nThe bodies of a legal entity shall be set up in the manner prescribed by its constitutional \ndocuments and the law. \n  \n2. To the extent provided by law, a legal entity acquires civil rights and obligations and \nexercises them through its members.  \n3. A body or person who according to the constitutional documents of the legal entity or the \nlaw acts in the name of the legal entity is obligated to act in the interests of the legal entity in \ngood faith and reasonably and not exceed its authority.  \nRestrictions on the representation of a legal entity shall not apply to its relations with third \nparties, unless the legal entity proves that a third party knew or, in all the circumstances, could \nnot have been unaware of such restrictions. \n \n4. If the members of a body of a legal entity or other persons who, according to the law or \nconstitutional documents act in the name of the legal entity, breach their obligations \nconcerning their representation, they shall be jointly and severally liable for losses that they \ncause to the legal entity.” \n380 As the Supreme Court put it in Bank Daniel at [77] {C2/79/23}: \n“The above statutory provisions provide for the obligations of the legal entity’s bodies \n(officials) to act in the best interests of the legal entity in good faith, reasonably and without \nabusing their powers and also provide for their liability for breach of the obligations (fiduciary \nduties).” \n(ii) Points of common ground \n381 It is common ground between Mr Beketov and Mr Alyoshin that breach of any of the \nfiduciary duties constitutes unlawful conduct for the purposes of Art. 1166 CC, and that \nsuch breach can occur by way of omission as well as by positive conduct.211  As the Grand \nChamber of the Supreme Court put it in Ukoopspilka, “[ t]he illegality of their [i.e. bank officials’ ] \nbehaviour  may consist in the commission of certain actions, and in their failure to commit, i.e. inaction \n(omission) ”.212 \n \n211  UkrJR/¶26.1 {C5/1/14}, ¶62.2 {C5/1/26}; Alyoshin XX {Day30/16:16-20}. \n212  Decision of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court dated 25.5.21 in Case No. 910/11027/18 at [7.74] \n{C9.8/1/37}. \nAA2/15/225\n219 382 It should be uncontroversial that members of a bank’s supervisory board will be subject to \nthe fiduciary duties imposed by the JSC Law, Law on Banks and CC.213 This is because: \n(1) Art. 63 of the JSC Law imposes duties upon the “[ o]fficers of a joint stock company’s bodies ” \n{C1/22/7}; “ officers ” are defined in Art. 2(1)(15) {C1/22/1} to include “ the chairman \nand members of the supervisory board ”. Mr Alyoshin agreed: {Day30/16:10-12}. \n(2) Arts. 42 and 43 of the Law on Banks impose duties upon the “ executives ” of a bank \n{C1/24/1}. Although the definition of that term has varied over time,214 it has always \nincluded, as set out in Art. 42, the bank’s “ chairman ” and “ members of the bank’s board of \ndirectors ”. Mr Alyoshin accepted that the definition of “executives”  includes D1-2, as \nmembers of the Bank’s Supervisory Board: {Day30/16:13-15}.  \n(3) Art. 92(3) CC applies to “[ a] body or person who according to the constitutional documents of the \nlegal entity or the law acts in the name of the legal entity ” {C1/6/3}; Art. 92(4) further refers \nto “the members of a body of a legal entity ”. Whilst the ‘bodies’ of a legal entity will vary \naccording to the entity’s type and constitution, it would in the case of a bank include \nits supervisory board.215  Remarkably, Mr Alyoshin initially claimed that it was “[ n]ot \nexactly ” correct that D1-2, as members of the supervisory board, fell within the scope \nof Art. 92(3) CC: {Day30/15:9} to {Day30/16:2}, although he eventually"}

Why he initially disputed this point, given that his own evidence was \nthat “[ D1] was subject to these provisions because he was a member of the Supervisory Board of the \nBank ”,216 is unclear and indicative of his lack of independence. \n383 It is also common ground that the “ other documents of the company ” referred to in Art. 63(1) of \nthe JSC Law and Art. 42 of the Law on Banks include, amongst other documents, the Bank’s \nCharter, Supervisory Board Regulations, and Credit Committee Regulations: UkrJR/¶65.3 \n{C5/1/27}. The experts further agree that the fiduciary duties expressed in the JSC Law \nand Law on Banks overlap but are not contradictory.217 Indeed, the Supreme Court routinely \napplies the fiduciary duties collectively.218 \n \n213  There are multiple examples in the case law of supervisory board members being so subject. See e.g. Bank \nDaniel {C2/79}; Tavrika Bank {C9.8/29.1}, decision of the Supreme Court dated 7.10.21 in Case No. \n910/12803/18; Ukoopspilka {C9.8/1}; Trust Bank {C9.8/30}, decision of the Supreme Court dated 28.10.21 \nin Case No. 901/9851/20. \n214  See Beketov8/¶218 {C1/1/72}. \n215  Beketov8/¶205 {C1/1/68}.  \n216  Alyoshin1/¶30 {C2/1/12}.  \n217  UkrJR/¶70 {C5/1/29}; Beketov8/¶232 {C1/1/77}. \n218  Beketov XX at {Day28/5:21-6}. See e.g. Bank Daniel {C2/79}; Tavrika Bank {C9.8/29.1}; Ukoopspilka \n{C9.8/1}; Trust Bank {C9.8/30/1}. \nAA2/15/226\n220 (iii) Scope and content of the fiduciary duties  \n384 The key dispute between the experts, as Mr Alyoshin puts it, is “ when such duties are engaged: \nMr Beketov is of the view that a bank’s executives such as supervisory board members owe them ‘at all \ntimes’, whereas I believe that such duties arise when the executives perform their roles (i.e. when they act in \ntheir capacities as such) ”.219 \n385 Thus, according to Mr Alyoshin’s written evidence, officers who misappropriate money \nfrom their bank will only breach their fiduciary duties when they commit fraud by exercising \na formal power  qua officer. Mr Alyoshin was, however, cross-examined on a hypothetical \nscenario in which a bank’s supervisory board members know that a fraud is about to be \ncommitted, and fail to stop it. This resulted in an extraordinary exchange in which Mr \nAlyoshin initially denied that such an omission would breach any fiduciary duties; then said \n“If they [fail to take preventative steps ], I assume that it could be unlawful. Whether it’s unlawful under \nArticle 92, 42 or whatever, I’m not in position to opine on that ”; and finally, when backed into a \ncorner, accepted that such an omission “ could be also breach of fiduciary duty ”.220 \n386 Notwithstanding this concession, Mr Alyoshin appeared to maintain his position that if \nsupervisory board members actually orchestrate (rather than permit) a fraud, they might have \ncommitted a criminal offence of “ abuse of official power ”, but will have committed no civil \nbreach of fiduciary duty221 – and thus will, apparently, have complied with their duty to act \n(in the words of the Supreme Court) “ in the best interests of the legal entity in good faith, reasonably \nand without abusing their powers ” {C2/79/23}. \n387 That was an extraordinary argument redolent of a complete lack of independence. It is not \nonly incoherent and illogical, but also ignores the reasoning of both the Grand Chamber and \nthe general Supreme Court on the scope and content of those duties.  \n388 Thus, in Ukoopspilka {C9.8/1}, a decision of t"}

It is not \nonly incoherent and illogical, but also ignores the reasoning of both the Grand Chamber and \nthe general Supreme Court on the scope and content of those duties.  \n388 Thus, in Ukoopspilka {C9.8/1}, a decision of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court \n(which has the task of “ ensur[ing] uniformity of practice between the other chambers and whose judgments \ncarry more weight than those of the other chambers ”,222 and which Mr Alyoshin described as issuing \njudgments setting out the “ legal position ” imposing a “ certain obligation to follow ”223):  \n \n219  Alyoshin2/¶99 {C7/1/37}, see also at ¶104 {C7/1/38}; see also D1Def/¶61(4)(b) {A1/8/37}, ¶61(8)(c) \n{A1/8/38}; D2Def/¶39(3)-(6) {A1/18/21}; D1 Opening/¶253 {AA3/1/83}.  \n220  Alyoshin XX {Day30/34:5} - {Day30/38:19}. \n221  Alyoshin XX {Day30/38:20} - {Day30/39:9}. \n222  UkrJR/¶3.3 {C5/1/4}. \n223  Alyoshin XX {Day30/139:7-16}. \nAA2/15/227\n221 (1) The Deposit Guarantee Fund (the “DGF” ) contended that the former management \nof the (now insolvent) bank, all of whom had been members of the Supervisory and \nManagement Boards, had decided to buy bonds, known by them to be loss making \nand unsecured, issued by two companies that appeared to be sham businesses related \nto the bank’s executives and owners. The purchase price of the bonds constituted \nnearly 60% of the asset value of the bank (see [1.2], [1.6] {C9.8/1/19}). \n(2) The DGF relied upon ( inter alia ) Art. 63 of the JSC Law ([7.12] {C9.8/1/30}), Arts. \n42 and 43 of the Law on Banks ([7.25]-[7.26] {C9.8/1/31}) and Art. 92(3) CC ([7.10] \n{C9.8/1/30}). It alleged (at [1.5] {C9.8/1/19}) that the defendants had breached their \nduties both by reason of their positive conduct and by omission:  \n“The claimant believed that the defendants did not perform their functions of risk \nmanagement, control and monitoring of all types of threats in all areas of the bank’s \nactivities, and vice versa – by their actions to withdraw funds from the bank to the \naccounts of other companies, they contributed to the occurrence of these risks, which \ncaused losses to PJSC JSB ‘Ukoopspilka’ and its creditors.” \n(3) The lower courts had rejected the DGF’s claim, finding that the DGF had failed to \nestablish the elements of an Art. 1166 claim ([2.2] {C9.8/1/20}. The Grand Chamber \nallowed the DGF’s appeal. At [7.14] to [7.17] {C9.8/1/30}, the Grand Chamber \nobserved that: \n“7.14 ... Pursuant to Article 92 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, persons acting on behalf \nof a legal entity are obliged to act not only within their powers, but also in good faith \nand reasonably. In view of the provisions of the above legal norm and the fiduciary \nnature of the relationship between a business company and its official (in particular, a \ndirector or general director), the unlawful behavior of an official may be expressed not \nonly in the failure to fulfill the duties expressly established by the company’s constituent \ndocuments or in the abuse of authority when performing certain actions on behalf of \nthe company, but also in improper and dishonest performance of such actions without \nobserving the limits of normal business risk, with personal interest or abuse of \ndiscretion, making obviously reckless or wasteful decisions. ... \n7.15 The above is in line with the international Principles of Corporate Governance of \nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which set out the main \nfiduciary duties of company directors, such as the duty of care (to act in good faith for \nthe benefit of the company’s development, devoting sufficient time, effort and \nprofessional skills to its management) and the duty of loyalty (to avoid conflicts of \ninterest and act in the best interes"}
{"start": 616000, "text": "ckless or wasteful decisions. ... \n7.15 The above is in line with the international Principles of Corporate Governance of \nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which set out the main \nfiduciary duties of company directors, such as the duty of care (to act in good faith for \nthe benefit of the company’s development, devoting sufficient time, effort and \nprofessional skills to its management) and the duty of loyalty (to avoid conflicts of \ninterest and act in the best interests of the company when making decisions on its \nactivities).  \n7.16 The main purpose of fiduciary duties is to ensure the economic development of \nthe company, and, accordingly, failure to comply with such basic duties may result in \nlosses to the company and the obligation to reimburse them.  \n7.17 Thus, when applying Article 92 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, it is necessary to \nassess not only the formal side of the issue - compliance by the official with all \nprovisions of the law, the articles of associations, decisions of the general meeting of \nAA2/15/228\n222 members / shareholders, etc. After all, even when an official has formally complied \nwith all the requirements of the law and the company’s constituent documents, his/her \nactions (inaction) may not be bona fide, reasonable and in the interests of the \ncompany.”  \n(4) The Grand Chamber thus made it clear that fiduciary duties do not only apply when \nan officer is formally acting in his role qua officer. The content of that duty (acting \nwith “ loyalty ”, “avoid[ing] conflicts of interest ”, “act[ing] when making decisions about the activities \nof the enterprise only in the interests of the latter ” and behaviour “ bona fide ” and “ reasonabl [y]”) \nare as capable of applying in informal situations as they are formally. Remarkably, Mr \nAlyoshin initially appeared to disagree with the proposition that officers were subject \nto a duty of loyalty, although, drilled down, he in fact appeared only to be making the \npoint that such a duty was part of the overarching fiduciary duties, rather than a \nseparate obligation.224 He later agreed that [7.15] and [7.17] represented accurate \nstatements of Ukrainian law (although, inexplicably, refused to make the same \nacknowledgment in relation to [7.16]).225 \n(5) At [7.35] {C9.8/1/33}, the Grand Chamber noted that the defendants had had the \nopportunity to demonstrate “ that their activities were in line with the interests of the bank and \nthat there were no grounds for their liability ””, including by showing that they had “ taken \nmeasures to prevent risky activities;226 or to prevent signs in the bank’s activities that may lead to the \nNBU’s conclusion that the bank is engaged in risky activities that threaten the interests of depositors \nor other creditors of the bank, in particular, through influence on the management or activities of a \nlegal entity … to identify persons responsible for risky activities, etc ”. The Grand Chamber found \nthat the defendants “ did not provide any evidence of their actions, which would indicate that they \nwere not guilty of failing to fulfil their obligations under the Law of Ukraine ‘On Banks and \nBanking’ to manage the bank’s activities in good faith, in a reasonable, responsible manner, and to \nprevent possible risks. ” (at [7.58] {C9.8/1/35}).  \n(6) In finding the defendants jointly and severally liable, the Grand Chamber concluded \nat [7.75] and [7.76] {C9.8/1/37} that: \n“The claimants, as managers of the bank with the appropriate degree of qualification \nand experience, knew or should have known about the systematic withdrawal of assets \nfrom the bank during 2014 by concluding bond purchase and sale agreements.

It does not \nmatter  [for] how much and what agreements of purchase and sale agreed or signed by \neach of the defendants.”  \n(7) The Court thus found the management and supervisory board members liable not just \nif and to the extent they had formally approved the impugned bond purchases, but \nalso because they should have identified the fraud and taken steps to prevent it. \n389 Mr Alyoshin was very keen to point out that the decision in Ukoopspilka was subsequently \ncancelled and remitted for retrial, following the application by one of the defendants to \nreview the decision based on newly discovered circumstances.227 However, those newly \ndiscovered circumstances related only to quantum: as the Grand Chamber put it (at [5.55]), \nthey “ affect the aggregate amount of damages claimed to be recovered from the defendants and the validity of \nthe claims in terms of determining the amount of damage caused to PJSC JSB Ukoopspilka ” \n{C9.8/29/16}.228 Mr Alyoshin begrudgingly accepted this point in XX: {Day30/42:7-14}. \nReflecting the narrow basis upon which the decision was remitted, Ukoopspilka has \ncontinued to be cited by the Supreme Court – thus, in the recent case of Finrostbank \n{C9.12/1/6},229 the Court cited and applied Ukoopspilka (at ¶¶36, 43, 48), and observed at \n¶45 {C9.12/1/10} that “ the cancellation did not occur due to a change in the legal position of the Court, \nwhich is set out in the said decision, but in connection with other circumstances established by the cassation \ncourt … ”. See also the (even more recent) decision of the Supreme Court in SFG Hermes at \n[5.33] {C9.7/11/13}. \n390 In Bank Daniel {C2/79}, which was handed down two months after Ukoopspilka (and in \nMr Alyoshin’s view “ reflects the most authoritative judicial view ”: Alyoshin2/¶105{C7/1/39}):  \n(1) Having cited Ukoopspilka, the Supreme Court (at [77]-[81] {C2/79/23}, and see also \n[158]-[164] {C2/79/34}) gave a materially identical summary to that set out at [7.14]-\n[7.17] of Ukoopspilka. In particular, it said at [154] {C2/79/33} that: \n“As follows from the findings of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court set out in \n[Ukoopspilka], Article 92 of the Civil Code speaks about fiduciary duties and joint and \n \n227  Alyoshin2/¶97 {C7/1/37}, ¶105 {C7/1/39}, ¶252 {C7/1/85}, ¶339 {C7/1/110}; Alyoshin XX \n{Day30/17:17} - {Day30/18:3}. \n228  See further Mr Beketov’s ( i) unchallenged explanation of the circumstances underlying the Grand Chamber’s \ndecision dated 3.8.22, at Beketov9/¶¶178 ff {C6/1/72}; and ( ii) list of other Supreme Court decisions \nsupporting the same guidance given by the Grand Chamber in Ukoopspilka on which he relies at \nBeketov9/¶¶184 {C6/1/74}. \n229  See also Alyoshin XX {Day30/44:9-14}.

Mr Alyoshin accepted as much in XX (“ Absolutely. Absolutely ”).230 \n(3) D1’s suggestion that the reasoning in Bank Daniel was confined to the contents of \npositive acts decision-making during board meetings231 is simply incorrect. See, for \nexample, at [123] {C2/79/29} (“ their failure to exercise proper control over the business \nindicators of the Bank (unlawful omission ”), [124] {C2/79/29} “ the subject of proof in this case \nis … facts of unlawful conduct of the respondents (… absence of an effective risk-prevention system of \nthe Bank …) ”, at [179] {C2/79/36} “ the duty to manage the Bank’s business in good faith, \nreasonably and responsibly, prevent possible risks, and meet economic standards ”, and at [214] \n{C2/79/45} “ it was the respondents, not the claimant, who had to prove the absence of any fault \non their part before the court, that is, proving that they took all possible measures and actions to \nprevent harm to the Bank, their good faith and reasonable behaviour as managers of the Bank ”. \n391 Trust Bank {C9.8/30}: \n(1) In addition to summarising the principles from Ukoopspilka and Bank Daniel, at [8.5] \n{C9.8/30/18} the Supreme Court observed that: \n“The term ‘fiduciary duty’ is defined in the Guidelines on Improving Corporate \nGovernance in Ukrainian Banks, approved by Resolution of the Board of the National \nBank of Ukraine No. 98 dated 28 March 2007, which were in force in the disputed \nperiod of 2013-2016. \nIn accordance with clause 1.12, Section I of these Guidelines, a fiduciary duty is an \nobligation to act in the best interests of another person. The bank’s manager (fiduciary) \nis obliged to act in the best interests of the bank ( i.e., all its shareholder and clients), and \nnot in personal (private) interests. A fiduciary is always required to act in good faith and \nwith impartiality. A fiduciary must be honest and must not conduct business in a \nmanner that provides him/her with undue benefits or harms the interests of clients or \nshareholders …  \nThe above Guidelines are indeed advisory in nature, but at the same time they set a \ncertain standard of proper behavior for bank managers, characterized by increased \nrequirements for good faith and reasonableness, prudence and decision-making in \nconducting business activities, taking into account the interests of the legal entity they \nrepresent.  \n \n230  Alyoshin XX {Day30/44:15} - {Day30/47:2}. \n231  Advanced at Alyoshin1/¶230 {C2/1/86}, and repeated in Beketov XX at {Day28/11:23} - {Day28/12:4}. \nAA2/15/231\n225 In view of the foregoing, the Supreme Court considers that the courts of previous \ninstances erroneously failed to apply to the disputed legal relations the Guidelines on \nImproving Corporate Governance in Ukrainian Banks … and the OECD Corporate \nGovernance Principles adopted by the OECD Council in 1999.” \n(2) The Supreme Court thus specifically instructed the lower courts to apply the NBU \nGuidelines and OECD Principles, both of which express the nature of fiduciary duties \nin broad and unqualified terms. As Mr Alyoshin acknowledged in XX, “ I agree that court \nrely on them to interpret the fiduciary duties … the court effectively said that the lower courts had to \ntake into account these guidelines ”: {Day30/48:20} - {Day30/49:18}. \n392 In SFG Hermes {C9.7/11}: \n(1) A claim was brought against the former sole shareholder and director of a ‘one-man’ \ncompany under Art."}

After the customary reference to Ukoopspilka \n(see [5.26]-[5.33] {C9.7/11/12}, [5.54]-[5.56] {C9.7/11/16}), the Supreme Court \nreferred to the defendant’s dual capacity at [5.35] {C9.7/11/13}: \n“… a director is not exempt from the obligations of a member to comply with the \nprovisions of the charter, and, as a director, he directly affects the activities of the \ncompany, enters into transactions on its behalf that have legal consequences for the \ncompany. A person having the status of a company’s shareholder should be aware that \nhis/her actions, in particular as a director, should not contradict the purpose of the \ncompany’s activities or impede the achievement of the company’s goals. Thus, the \nstatus of a director and a shareholder are combined, which presupposes their joint and \ninseparable legal responsibility.”  \n(2) The Supreme Court was thus expressly indicating that an individual could not insulate \nhimself from his duties qua shareholder and qua director, depending on the particular \n‘hat’ he was wearing at the time; to the contrary, his actions at all times were required \nto further the interests of the company. \n(3) It should be noted that this was not a case involving an insolvent bank, or a claim by \nthe DGF; the Supreme Court nevertheless cited and applied Ukoopspilka. That \nexposes as baseless Mr Alyoshin’s partisan attempt to suggest that Ukoopspilka was \n“absolutely irrelevant. It’s not available to the Bank. Ukoopspilka case, it’s specific case for specific \npurposes with specific claimant with specific harm ”.232 To the contrary, it is clear that the \nSupreme Court regards the principles articulated in Ukoopspilka, and in the cases that \nfollowed it, as being of universal application: see also the decision of the Grand \nChamber in Gas Resource Company (another non-insolvency/non-bank case) at [57]-\n \n232  Alyoshin XX {Day32/21:15-22}; see also {Day30/34:13-25}; {Day30/41:11-20}. \nAA2/15/232\n226 [60] {C7/38/9}, concluding that the company’s former general director was liable in \ntort because his “ actions were obviously committed for a purpose contrary to the interests of the \ncompany ”.233 \n393 The contents of fiduciary duties have been elaborated in the ‘Principles of Corporate \nGovernance’ set out by the National Securities and Stock Market Commission of Ukraine \n(“NSSMC” ), which have been referred to and applied by the Supreme Court234 and at first \ninstance.235 ¶3.3.1 of the Principles{C9.8/24.02} states as follows:  \n“3.3.1.

By their very nature, \nthese are not activities that could be undertaken in the course of performing any official \nduties for the company itself. \n395 Further arguments raised by Ds take the matter no further: \n \n233  Decision of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court dated 26.11.19 in Case No. 910/20261/16 {C7/38}. \n234  Avdiivka Coke Plant, decision of the Supreme Court dated 15.6.22 in Case No. 905/671/19 [79]-[80] \n{C9.8/33.1/16}. In Bank Daniel (at ¶158) the Supreme Court also made it clear they “ agree[d] with the appellant’s \narguments that the courts may apply acts of recommendation nature in weighing the merits of the action/inactivity of the \nrespondents ” {C2/79/34}. \n235  Avdiivka Coke Plant, decision of the Commercial Court of Donetsk Region dated 25.09.23 in Case No. \n905/1926/18 {C9.13/7/19}.  \nAA2/15/233\n227 (1) D1 and Mr Alyoshin’s various attempts to suggest that acts of procurement cannot \nconstitute unlawful conduct236 were obviously wrong. It is not controversial that there \nis no specific wrong of ‘procurement’ or ‘inducement’ as a matter of Ukrainian civil \nlaw. But breach of fiduciary duties is unlawful conduct. And given that (as discussed \nabove) a fiduciary’s duties extend to protecting his company from harm, as well as \nacting in the best interests of his company, it cannot be seriously in doubt that a \nfiduciary who procures somebody else to defraud his bank will have breached his duty. \nMr Alyoshin’s attempt, having finally accepted that an officer’s failure to prevent a \nfraud would be a breach of duty, to maintain that there would be no breach if the \nofficer procured the fraud, served only to underline his total lack of independence. \n(2) There was an attempt in Mr Beketov’s XX237 to suggest that there was no need for a \nwide interpretation of the breach of fiduciary duties, because a bank had other routes \navailable to it in Ukraine by which it could bring fraudulent officers to justice, namely \nby (i) claiming as a victim within or off the back of criminal proceedings; or ( ii) relying \nupon a claim brought by the DGF on behalf of an insolvent bank. That is no answer:   \n(a) Dependence upon receipt of a guilty verdict in criminal proceedings is obviously \nno substitute for pursuit of a civil claim; and would require the alleged unlawful \nact first to be proven to a higher standard before a criminal court before a civil \nclaim could be brought. That would de facto  import the criminal standard of \nproof into civil claims in respect of unlawful (in the tortious sense) conduct that \nmay also be criminal.

That would de facto  import the criminal standard of \nproof into civil claims in respect of unlawful (in the tortious sense) conduct that \nmay also be criminal. Moreover, it would leave any claimant dependent upon \nthe effectiveness and timeliness of criminal prosecuting authorities (and indeed \non those authorities’ ability to bring the fraudsters before a criminal court).  \n(b) Whilst Art. 52(7) of the DGF Law {C6/3/85} provides for a mechanism to \nbring a claim against an insolvent bank’s officers or its related parties in certain \ninstances, such a claim can only be brought by the DGF ( i.e. a third party), and \nnot by the Bank itself. Moreover, Art. 52(7) provides that such a claim can only \nbe brought with respect to an insolvent bank in liquidation or within three years \nafter its liquidation. Given that the Bank is not in liquidation, neither the Bank \nnor the DGF can bring (or could have brought) a claim under Art. 52 of the \n \n236  D1 Opening/¶265(1) {AA3/1/87}; D2 Opening/¶261.4 {AA4/1/103}; UkrJR/¶29 {C5/1/15}; \nAlyoshin1/¶226 {C2/1/84}, ¶266 {C2/1/99}; Alyoshin2/¶135 {C7/1/49}, ¶¶256-258 {C7/1/86}. \n237  {Day28/1:13} ff.  \nAA2/15/234\n228 DGF Law. The suggestion by D1 to the contrary thus provides no answer; and \nappears to have been improvised, finding no support in any expert’s report. \n(3) The ‘executive seeking a pay rise’ scenario238 is a red herring. The correct analysis is \nnot that a bank officer owes no fiduciary duties in such a scenario; rather, in such an \nobvious case of (as Mr Beketov put it239) “conflict of interest ”, the bank officer must rather \nact pursuant to his fiduciary duties by ensuring that (for example) any such decision is \nconsidered by the board or members without his influence and without his ability to \nvote upon the resolution. It is precisely for this reason that a procedure for the \nresolution of such an issue is frequently the subject of express provision in a \ncompany’s documents. Indeed, in another such scenario put to Mr Alyoshin (of a bank \nofficer with an interest in a tendering contractor), Mr Alyoshin agreed that the officer \nwould be obliged to disclose his interest to the bank “ as soon as the supervisory board \nmember realises … irrespective of whether the board member is sitting at a board meeting ”.240 \n396 To summarise, then:  \n(1) The authorities in no way support the narrow construction of the scope of the \nfiduciary duties suggested by Mr Alyoshin. \n(2) The Supreme Court has framed the duties in broad and general terms, emphasising \nthat bank officials must avoid conflicts of interest, act in good faith, refrain from \nabusing the position and opportunities they enjoy qua officials, and generally seek to \n“ensure the economic development of the enterprise ”. The Court’s frequent reference to OECD, \nNBU and NSSMC corporate governance principles underlines the point. \n(3) In order to comply with the fiduciary duties, bank officials must not only ensure that \ntheir actions are taken in good faith, reasonably and in the best interests of the bank, \nbut also that they have responsibly managed the bank and taken measures to prevent \nso-called ‘risky activity’. As the Grand Chamber put it in Ukoopspilka, “ the plaintiffs as \nmanagers of the bank with the appropriate degree of qualification and experience knew or should have \nknown about the systematic withdrawal of assets from the bank ” (at [7.75] {C9.8/1/37}). \n \n238  Posited at Alyoshin2/¶107{C7/1/40}; see also Beketov XX {Day28/96:5} ff; Alyoshin XX {Day30/30:17} -\n{Day30/32:5}. \n239  Beketov XX {Day28/96:13}. \n240  Alyoshin XX {Day30/26:14} - {Day30/30:16}. \nAA2/15/235\n229 (4) A fortiori , officials who not only stand by and fail to prevent a widespread fraud again"}

The supervisory board of a joint stock company is the body that protects the rights \nof the company’s shareholders and, within the bounds of its jurisdiction as defined by \nthe charter and this Law, controls and regulates the activity of the executive body. \n…  \n4. Members of the supervisory board shall perform their duties personally and may not \ndelegate their powers to another person, except for a member of the supervisory board \nthat is a corporate shareholder.” \n(2) Art. 52(3) of the JSC Law {C6/3/156}, under the heading “ Supervisory board reserved \nmatters ”, similarly states that “[ t]he matters exclusively referred for a supervisory board of a joint \nstock company may not be decided by any other bodies of that company, other than general meetings, \nexcept as provided for in this Law ”.242 \n399 In the case of the Bank:  \n(1) From 2012 until April 2015, clause 9.3.3 of the Bank’s Charter reserved, as a matter \nwithin “ the exclusive competence of the Supervisory Board [which] cannot be decided by other bodies \nof the Bank, except for the General Meeting of the Bank ”, the approval of transactions with \nrelated parties exceeding a market value of US$500,000 (or equivalent).243 \n \n241  The version of Art. 51(4) set out in this paragraph was in force from 2.3.11 to 30.4.16: Beketov8/¶211(b) \n{C1/1/70}. Art. 51(4) was subsequently amended to remove the exception for legal entities.  \n242  Referred to at Beketov8/¶212(b) {C1/1/70}. \n243  See clause 9.3.3(45) and the final paragraph of clause 9.3.3, present in the following versions of the Bank’s \nCharter: {C1/210/24} (version dated 12.4.12); {C1/211/15} (version dated 26.3.13); {K1/227.1/29} (version \ndated 26.4.13); {K1/228/29} (version dated 25.4.14); {K1/229/29} (version dated 10.2.15). In the versions \nof the Bank’s Charter dated 27-30.4.15 and 10.7.15, this power was no longer stated to be within the exclusive \ncompetence of the Supervisory Board: see {K1/230/31} and {K1/231/30}.  \nAA2/15/236\n230 (2) An equivalent stipulation appeared in clause 3.1.45 the Bank’s Supervisory Board \nRegulations, again until April 2015.244  \n(3) At all material times, clause 2.4 of the Bank’s Credit Committee Regulations required \nall loans exceeding US$2m in value (whether with related parties or not) to be \nsubmitted to the Supervisory Board for approval.245  \n400 There is a dispute between the experts as to whether a failure to ensure compliance with \nthese provisions (“ without more ” – a rather pregnant qualification on the part of Mr Alyoshin) \nby supervisory board members is capable of constituting a breach of fiduciary duty.246  Here, \nthe Bank contends that it does indeed give rise to a breach, given that the Supervisory Board \nmembers were obliged ( i) not to delegate their duty of approval; ( ii) to supervise the Bank’s \nday-to-day managers; and "}

When exercising their rights, a person is obliged to refrain from actions that could violate \nthe rights of others, cause harm to the environment or cultural heritage. \n3. Actions of a person committed with the intent to harm another person, as well as the abuse \nof right in other forms, are not allowed.” \n403 Also related to abuse of rights is Art. 16(3) {C1/6/2}, which states that “[ a] court may refuse \nto protect a person’s civil right or interest if that person is in breach of the provisions of paragraphs two to five \nof Article 13 of this Code ”. \n404 As Mr Alyoshin explains,247 “[t]he essence of Article 13(2)-(3) is that rights may only be exercised for \nlegitimate purposes. Where a party abuses a right by using it for an illegitimate purpose, the court will not \n \n244  See {C1/215/5} (8.8.11 version); {C1/216/5} (25.4.14 version).

Thus, for example, in  Person 1 v Person 2 {C2/73}, the Supreme \nCourt said at {C2/73/9} that:  \n“The essence of abuse of the right consists in commission by the authorized person of the \nactions which make the maintenance of the corresponding subjective civil right, in bad faith, \nincluding contrary to the purpose of such right.” \n(i) Articles 3(1)(2) and 13(2)-(3) as unlawful conduct  \n405 The principal dispute between the experts is as to whether breaches of Arts. 3(1)(2) and/or \n13(2)-(3) CC can constitute unlawful conduct for the purposes of a claim under Art. 1166 \nCC.248  Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida say they cannot; Mr Beketov says that they can. Mr \nBeketov’s view is clearly the preferable one, for the following reasons:  \n406 First, the Supreme Court has reiterated, on many occasions, that the principles set out in \nArt. 3 CC are rules ( aka norms) of direct application. See, for example, Person 1 v LOS \nKarlivske Agricultural Enterprise at {C7/26/9}: “ the general principles are essentially the directly \napplicable rules ” and Alfabank at {C7/27/12}: “ the general principles of are in their essence the norms \nof direct effect … ”. \n407 In a similar vein, the Supreme Court in Person 1 v Person 2 {C2/73/10}, considering Art. \n13 CC, said: \n“Execution of subjective civil rights shall be carried out strictly in compliance with the \nprinciples of lawfulness of execution of subjective civil rights, autonomy of will, principles of \nreasonability and good faith. Their totality is an obligatory condition to be applied at exercising \nall subjective civil rights with no exception.” \n408 That language is not, as Mr Alyoshin sought"}

Their totality is an obligatory condition to be applied at exercising \nall subjective civil rights with no exception.” \n408 That language is not, as Mr Alyoshin sought to suggest in XX, merely “ interpretative ”.249  To \nthe contrary, the clear conclusion to be drawn from these pronouncements is that breach of \nthe general principles set out in Art. 3(1), and abusing a legal right, as prohibited by Arts. \n13(2)-(3), constitutes unlawful conduct. The Supreme Court has described unlawfulness as \n“behaviour which violates the mandatory rules of law ”,250 and Mr Beketov and Mr Alyoshin agree \nthat “ a defendant’s conduct can be unlawful if it breaches any provision of the Ukrainian Constitution, laws \n(statutes) … ”.251  There is no logical or coherent reason why Arts. 3 and 13 – provisions of \nthe CC expressed in mandatory terms and recognised by the Supreme Court as constituting \nrules of direct application – should be excluded from this definition.

Thus:  \n(1) In Bank Familniy v Persons 1-3 {C9.8/3}, the bank sought to invalidate gifts made \nby Person 1 to his children, Persons 2 and 3. Person 1 had previously been found \nguilty of a crime, and liable to compensate the bank. The Grand Chamber ruled (as \nMr Alyoshin agreed: {Day30/10:18-25}) that the gift could be held invalid under both \nArt. 3(1)(6) – the general principles of justness, good faith and reasonableness – and \nArt. 13(3). It held at {C9.8/3/6} that: \n“A civil law contract (including a gift agreement) shall not be used by participants in \ncivil relations to avoid payment of a debt or execution of a court decision (including a \nsentence) on the recovery of funds that has entered into force. The debtor (a donor) \nagainst whom a judgment on recovery of funds has been passed and enforcement \nproceedings have been opened, and his sons (donees), who enter into a gift agreement, \nact obviously dishonestly and abuse their rights against the creditor, as a gift agreement \nthat violates the property interests of the creditor and is aimed at preventing foreclosure \non the debtor’s property. Therefore, the rule of law cannot leave out of action such \nactions, which, although they do not violate specific imperative norms, are obviously \ndishonest and amount to an abuse of rights.” \n(2) Similar conclusions were reached by the Supreme Court in Svitwood Ukraine at \n{C2/75/8} and Sberbank v Euroalliance Realty and Yuststar at [11.11] {C9.8/2/10}. \n(3) In Sirius-Bud {C7/78}, the claimant company’s sole property (a department store \nbuilding) was sold at auction at an undervalue, its sale price having been determined \nby a forged valuation report.

The property was then sold a number of further times in \nquick succession. Sirius-Bud was shortly afterwards declared bankrupt, and its \nliquidator sought to have the auction and subsequent sale declared invalid. The \nSupreme Court, finding that the impugned auction was invalid (at ¶80 {C7/78/30}) \nand rejecting a limitation defence (¶95.3 {C7/78/41}), said:  \n“transactions concluded by participants in civil relations should have a certain legal and \nfactual purpose, which should not be obviously illegal and unconscionable. The deed \ncannot be used by participants to avoid paying a debt or executing a court decision.” \n(at [76.6] {C7/78/29}) \n“A person’s use of his subjective right not to satisfy legitimate interests, but with the \naim of harming creditors, evading the fulfilment of obligations to creditors is an \nobvious use of private law instruments contrary to its purpose (‘use of the right to \nharm’). Under these conditions, the invalidity of the contract as a private legal category \nAA2/15/239\n233 is a tool designed to prevent or prevent [ sic] violations of civil rights and interests, or to \nrestore them.” (at [79] {C7/78/30}) \n“the application of statutes of limitation is subject to the general principles of \nsubstantive civil law, which are of a fundamental nature and are norms of direct effect \n…” (at [94.5] {C7/78/40})  \n“deciding on the importance of the reasons for missing the limitation period … the \ncourt, considering the provisions of Article 13 of the Civil Code of Ukraine … has to \ntake into account the good faith conduct of both the claimant (plaintiff) and the \ndefendant …” (at [94.1] {C7/78/39}) \n“[the prohibition against abuse of rights] applies not only to the claimant who asks for \ncertain remedies, but also to the defendant who is defended against the claim [ sic] by \nraising certain objections (including claiming that the claimant has missed the limitation \nperiod).” (at [94.6] {C7/78/40}) \n(4) In Fakel {C2/33}, NVP brought a claim for an unpaid contractual debt against Fakel. \nFakel filed a counterclaim alleging that the contract was invalid, because it had been \nconcluded by its general director without the consent of Fakel’s supervisory board. \nThe Supreme Court allowed NVP’s appeal, granted its claim and rejected Fakel’s \ncounterclaim, agreeing with NVP’s arguments that Fakel’s conduct was contradictory, \ncontrary to the doctrine of venire contra factum proprium  and showed signs of abuse of \nrights (in sum, because its counterclaim alleging lack of authority appeared to be a \nconcoction formulated solely to provide a defence to NVP’s claim: see [63] \n{C2/33/11}). The Court noted at [61] {C2/33/11} that “[ i]n accordance with Part 3 of \nArt. 13 of the Civil Code, actions of a person committed with the intent to harm another person, as \nwell as abuse of rights in other forms are not allowed ”, and so concluded it was reasonable \n“[t]o apply the principle of prohibition of contradictory conduct to the disputed legal relations, which \nis based on the fact that no one can act contrary to their previous conduct, as well as Art. 13 of the \nCivil Code on the prohibition of abuse of rights ” (at [62] {C2/33/11}). \n(5) These authorities demonstrate that the courts are willing to apply Arts. 3 and 13 in a \nvariety of different contexts.

Mr Alyoshin’s suggestion in XX that abuse of rights “ for \nthe specific purpose - - for the purpose of contractual relations, it could be treated as unlawful, not for \nthe purpose of tortious relations ”252 draws an illogical and unprincipled distinction (if \nconduct is unlawful as a matter of civil law for the purpose of rendering a contract \ninvalid, then it must be unlawful for all purposes governed by civil law). Mr Alyoshin \nhas been unable to point to any provision in the CC or indeed any other Ukrainian \nlaw on which to draw this distinction, which is itself contradicted by the trend of the \n \n252  Alyoshin XX {Day30/11:1-7}. \nAA2/15/240\n234 case law and his own acknowledgment (in relation to abuse of right) that “ the scope of \nthe concept has been left deliberately vague and the doctrine must be applied on a case by case basis ”.253 \n410 Thirdly, although Mr Alyoshin relied upon, and quoted extracts from, academic essays which \nhe suggested “ supported ” his view that abuse of rights was not capable of constituting \nunlawful conduct for the purposes of a claim in tort,254 the reality was revealed to be the \nexact opposite. The extracts quoted and exhibited by Mr Alyoshin {C7/32/2}, when \ncompared against full translations of the same essays obtained by the Bank {C9.8/43.1}, \nconveniently omitted statements by those authors in which they took precisely the contrary \nview to that which Mr Alyoshin represented.255 Indeed, Mr Alyoshin did not even exhibit a \ncomplete copy of the Ukrainian originals of the essays to his report, having extracted just \ntwo pages from each – these had instead to be sourced and translated in full by the Bank. \nThus: \n(1) In the essay by Karnaukh – a full translation of which appears at {C9.8/43.1/6-13} – \nthe author observed that “ the consequence of abuse is usually not liability in the form of depriving \na person of what is his or her property, but only a refusal to recognize the person’s right to what he or \nshe tried to obtain as a result of the abuse ”. However, he went on to say in the final few lines \nof the same paragraph – which Mr Alyoshin left out of his exhibited translation \n{C7/32/2} – that “[ h]owever, there is an exception to this rule when actual harm is caused to \nanother person as a result of the abuse. In this case, the damage is subject to compensation, and \ncompensation for damage is recognized as a measure of civil liability. This is natural, since any damage \ncaused by unlawful actions obliges the perpetrator to compensate for it (see Articles 1166, 1167 of \nthe Civil Code of Ukraine) ”.  \n(2) In the essay by Stefanchuk – a full translation of which appears at {C9.8/43.1/14-31} \n– the author similarly stated (in a paragraph not referred to by Mr Alyoshin, or indeed \nincluded in the Ukrainian language pages of the essay exhibited to his report – \n{C7/32/2} and {C7/32/7-8}) that: \n“… it should not be forgotten that abuse is unlawful behavior, and according to the \nprinciple of general tort, damage to property of individuals and legal entities is subject \nto full compensation in cases where it is caused by unlawful (and, in cases provided for \nby law, lawful) and, as a rule, culpable actions. This liability may be expressed not only \nin compensation for the damage caused, but also in the obligation to eliminate the \nnegative consequences caused by the abuse of the right at their own expense, i.e. to \nrestore the situation that existed before the violation (clause 4, part 2, Article 16 of the \n \n253  Alyoshin1/¶204 {C2/1/74}; see similarly Beketov8/¶86 {C1/1/29}. \n254  Alyoshin2/¶¶89-90 {C7/1/33}, referring to essays by Stefanchuk and Karnaukh at {C7/32}.  \n255  Alyoshin XX {Day29/155:21} ff. \nAA2/15/241\n235 Civil Code of Ukraine), as well as to compen"}

Moreover, the selective translation and quotation of the Karnaukh and \nStefanchuk essays formed two examples of what, as became clear over the course of \nMr Alyoshin’s XX, proved to be a deeply concerning theme in Mr Alyoshin’s approach \nto translating, exhibiting and citing authorities {Day30/160:3-6}.  \n411 Fourthly, the decision of the Constitutional Court in Industrialbank {C9.8/18.1}, which was \nput to Mr Beketov in XX as a case establishing that abuse of rights was not a ground of \nunlawfulness,256 in fact confirms no more than that abuse of rights is not in and of itself a \nfreestanding cause of action; in the words of the Court, “ these provisions of the Code do not qualify \na person’s actions as an offence under civil law as another condition for holding a person liable under civil \nlaw” (at [8.2] {C9.8/18.1/7}). What the judgment does not say is that abuse of rights is \nincapable of constituting unlawful conduct for the purposes of tort. Indeed, as is clear from \nKarnaukh’s essay at {C9.8/43.1/10} (and as Mr Beketov also explained in XX \n{Day27/150:9-20}, a distinction is to be drawn between an “ offence ” (i.e. a cause of action, \nlike a claim in tort or unjust enrichment) and “ unlawful actions ”.257 \n(ii) Scope of Art. 3(1)(2) CC \n412 Mr Alyoshin makes various further arguments seeking to confine the scope of the general \nprinciple enshrined in Art. 3(1)(2) CC; specifically, he has suggested that: \n(1) Art. 3(1)(2) is simply a prohibition against state expropriation, such that it does not \napply to claims between private parties;258 \n(2) The provision “ is limited to protecting proprietary rights and is irrelevant to the present dispute \nwhere no proprietary claim is advanced ”;259 and \n \n256  Beketov XX {Day27/150:5-8}.  \n257  As an aside, it should be noted that the Constitutional Court in Industrialbank expressly rejected an argument \nthat the content of ‘abuse of rights’ was “ not clearly and unambiguously defined ”: it held at [3.6] {C9.8/18.1/4} that \n“the Constitutional Court of Ukraine believes that a party to civil relations, if necessary, through appropriate advice, will be able \nto reasonably predict which of the party’s actions may be further classified as unfair and contrary to the limits of exercise of civil \nrights, in particular in the form of abuse of rights, and what legal consequences of such actions will be ”. \n258  Alyoshin1/¶¶200-201 {C2/1/73}; UkrJR/¶32.3 {C5/1/16}. \n259  Alyoshin2/¶67 {C7/1/27}. \nAA2/15/242\n236 (3) Because the Bank transferred funds to the Borrowers pursuant to contracts, “ the funds \nwere voluntarily transferred by the Bank to the Borrowers on the basis of civil law transactions … \n[c]onsequently, ‘deprivation’ is not a proper term for such voluntary exchanges ”.260 \n413 These arguments should be rejected as having no basis in the wording of the CC or any \nother provision of Ukrainian law, which simply does not draw the distinctions that Mr \nAlyoshin posits; and as running counter to Ukrainian court practice. \n414 As to the first (expropriation by the state):  \n(1) There is nothing in the wording of Art"}
{"start": 658000, "text": "by the Bank to the Borrowers on the basis of civil law transactions … \n[c]onsequently, ‘deprivation’ is not a proper term for such voluntary exchanges ”.260 \n413 These arguments should be rejected as having no basis in the wording of the CC or any \nother provision of Ukrainian law, which simply does not draw the distinctions that Mr \nAlyoshin posits; and as running counter to Ukrainian court practice. \n414 As to the first (expropriation by the state):  \n(1) There is nothing in the wording of Art. 3(1)(2) to indicate that it should be so confined. \nIndeed, the language of Art. 3(1)(2) may be contrasted to that of Art. 321(3), which – \nas part of an article on “[ i]nviolability of Ownership ” generally – makes specific provision \non “[ c]ompulsory alienation [of] property ” {C1/6/9}. \n(2) The article cited by Mr Alyoshin in support of his view that “ ‘deprivation’ of property refers \nto the state’s exercise of its sovereign power ”,261 by Antonyuk, in fact concluded that “[ t]he \ncontent of the principle of inviolability of property right lies in the inadmissibility of arbitrary \ninterference with this right by private and public law entities, including the state … ”. This was \nanother example of Mr Alyoshin’s selective, partisan and misleading approach to \nquotation: compare Mr Alyoshin’s exhibit at {C2/67/2} with the full article, translated \nby the Bank, at {C9.8/18.01}, and see Alyoshin XX at {Day29/121:23} ff. Indeed, as \nhe revealingly admitted, “ to support my view I refer to some authority which support my view, \nand that’s what I did ” {Day29/141:7-9}. The article by Borisova {C2/79}262 to which \nMr Alyoshin was keen to refer the Court the following day {Day30/5:19} - \n{Day30/6:1} makes no suggestion that Art. 3(1)(2) CC is limited to state \nexpropriation: it simply makes the basic point that “ the State does not interfere with ” the \nexercise of ownership rights. \n(3) Multiple cases have cited and relied upon Art. 3(1)(2) in the context of what were \nindisputably proceedings between private parties. Thus, for example, in Ukrainian \nOrthodox Church {C9.8/28.1}, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church sued the Tulchyn \ndiocese, alleging that disaffected priests within the diocese had refused to hand over \nthe keys and title deeds to a church, and obstructed the UOC, its representatives and \nparishioners from entering the building ([31]-[36] {C9.8/28.1/5}). The Supreme \n \n260  Alyoshin2/¶74 {C7/1/29}; D1 Opening/¶240 {AA3/1/80}. \n261  Alyoshin1/¶200 {C2/1/73}. \n262  Referred to at Alyoshin2/¶72 {C7/1/28}. \nAA2/15/243\n237 Court, in remitting the case for a retrial, referred to Article 3(1)(2) CC (at [73] \n{C9.8/28.1/9}) and the equivalent provision of the Constitution of Ukraine (Article \n41) (at [69] {C9.8/28.1/8}). Contrary to a suggestion Mr Alyoshin made during XX,263 \nthe Supreme Court directly applied Article 3(1)(2) CC: see [81]-[86] {C9.8/28.1/9}.264 \n415 As to the second (proprietary claims):  \n(1) Mr Alyoshin appears to have confused property rights with proprietary claims. \n(2) Art. 3(1)(2) spells out that deprivation of ownership without legal entitlement is \nunlawful. It does not address what remedies are available for such unlawful behaviour \n(as Mr Alyoshin agreed – “ it’s about principle ” {Day29/149:8-10}). It most certainly \ndoes not contain any wording to suggest that the only remedy to which a person \ndeprived of ownership of their property is entitled is a proprietary one.  \n(3) Indeed, the Constitutional Court in the State Savings Bank case {C7/28} (which Mr \nAlyoshin inexplicably cites265) accepted that a bank’s contractual entitlement to receive \ninterest on monies outstanding under a loan agreement constituted ‘property’ as a \nmatter of Ukrainian law, despite the fact that the bank’s claim was strictly personal, \nand not proprietary, in nature. \n(4) In XX, Mr Alyoshin initially tried to suggest that taking somebody’s money, whilst \n“illegal action definitely ”, was nevertheless “ not violation of Article 3 ”"}
{"start": 661500, "text": "te Savings Bank case {C7/28} (which Mr \nAlyoshin inexplicably cites265) accepted that a bank’s contractual entitlement to receive \ninterest on monies outstanding under a loan agreement constituted ‘property’ as a \nmatter of Ukrainian law, despite the fact that the bank’s claim was strictly personal, \nand not proprietary, in nature. \n(4) In XX, Mr Alyoshin initially tried to suggest that taking somebody’s money, whilst \n“illegal action definitely ”, was nevertheless “ not violation of Article 3 ”, but eventually he \nagreed that “[ i]llegal taking somebody’s property, it’s a breach of property rights of the owner of that \nproperty ”: {Day29/148:15} - {Day29/149:10}. \n416 As to the third (transfer pursuant to contract), that argument ignores the fact that the Bank \nwas procured to enter into the (void) Relevant Loans as part of a fraud; the transfers were \ntherefore far from voluntary, but indeed precisely for the purpose of “ ownership deprivation ”. \n(3) The second element: harm to property \n417 ‘Harm’ bears a broad meaning under Ukrainian law. It is common ground that money, \nwhether in the form of cash or in a bank account, is a form of property, that “ the transfer of a \nclaimant’s funds to a third party ” is capable of constituting ‘harm’ for the purpose of Art. 1166 \n \n263  Alyoshin XX {Day29/144:15} - {Day29/146:10}. \n264  Decision of the Supreme Court dated 16.6.21 in Case No. 902/627/19. See also Person 1 v Peasant Farm \n‘Renaissance’, decision of the Supreme Court dated 11.6.20 in Case No. 140/891/17 {C9.8/28.2}, in which a \nlandlord sued a tenant for the return of a land plot after the tenancy had expired. The Supreme Court referred \nto, and applied, Art. 3(1)(2) CC and Art. 41 of the Constitution {C9.8/28.2/5}. \n265  At Alyoshin2/¶68 {C7/1/27}. \nAA2/15/244\n238 CC,266 and that deprivation of money is actionable under Art. 1166 CC.267 Mr Alyoshin also \naccepts that where a defendant commits an unlawful act that involves a deprivation of \nproperty (such as a misappropriation), then harm is suffered as soon as the victim is deprived \nof its property: Alyoshin1/¶172 {C2/1/62}. Events subsequent to the actionable harm, \nsuch as the purported use of misappropriated funds, or the purported return to the claimant \nof any such funds, cannot therefore have any bearing on whether or not an actionable harm \noccurred, and accordingly has no bearing on issues of tortious liability. The relevance of \nsuch events, if any, falls to be considered when assessing the quantum of damages \nrecoverable. Issues in relation to loss/quantum are discussed in detail in Section M below. \n(4) The third element: causation \n418 It is common ground between Mr Beketov, Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida that the CC \ndoes not set out a statutory test for causation, and that accordingly no such test is prescribed \nby Ukrainian law; rather, causation is established on a case-by-case basis: UkrJR/¶40 \n{C5/1/18}. As Mr Alyoshin puts it, “[ w]hether a causal link exists in a given situation is ultimately \na question of fact, on which I express no opinion ”.268 \n419 The Supreme Court has, in practice, approached its factual assessment of the necessary \ncausal link in a variety of different ways; thus: \n(1) In Transzaliznychservice at [5.13] {C2/92/7}:269 “The tortfeasor’s unlawful conduct causes \nharm only when it is directly related to the harm ”. \n(2) In Person 1 v Pidkaminska Village Council at {C9.8/26.1/6}:270 “the committed unlawful \nact is the main reason that led to the infliction of moral harm  …”. \n(3) In SI-Invest at [52] {C9.13/3/22}:271 \n“The causal link between the unlawful conduct of a person and the damage caused is a \nmandatory condition of liability, which implies that the damage was an objective \nconsequence of the conduct of the person causing the damage.” \n \n266  D1Def/¶60(1) {A1/8/34}.  \n267  UkrJR/¶42 {C5/1/19}.  \n268  Alyoshin1/¶256 {C2/1/95}; see also Beketov9/¶44 {C6/1/18}; Alyoshin XX {Day32/3:19-22}, \n{Day32/5:16} - {Day32/6:3}. \n269  De"}

Although Mr Alyoshin suggested \nin XX that this decision had been cancelled {Day32/4:18-24}, that was incorrect: the Supreme Court had \nremitted the claim to the Court of Appeal for a retrial. In a subsequent decision dated 24.5.23 {C9.13/5}, the \nSupreme Court overturned the Court of Appeal’s judgment. The statement of principle in relation to causation \nquoted above was not questioned. \n271  Decision of the Supreme Court dated 2.8.22 in Case No. 908/314/18. See also at [48.4(3)] {C9.13/3/21}. See \nalso Luganian Agrochemical Service Company, decision of the Supreme Court dated 16.6.21 at [42] \n{C9.9/4/8}. \n{AA2/15/358}\nAA2/15/245\n239 420 As Mr Alyoshin also recognises, there are a further group of cases in which causation has \nbeen held to be established where “ the scope of duty assumes the possibility of the damages claimed ”:272 \n(1) Thus, in State Environmental Inspectorate in the Ivano-Frankivsk Region at [6.2.4] \n{C2/93/7}, a national park was found liable in tort for unlawful logging conducted \non its territory by third parties (tree fellers), on the basis that:  \n“… the duty to ensure protection of forest stands [sic – “ plantations ” may be a better \ntranslation] is assigned specifically to permanent forest users who are responsible for \nnon-performance or improper performance of such duties … civil liability for violation \nof forest legislation should be borne not only by persons who directly carry out \nunlawful logging (harm to trees), but also by permanent forest users, whose fault lies in \nunlawful inaction in the form of non-performance of actions to ensure the protection \nand preservation of the forest from unlawful logging on the plots under this jurisdiction \nfrom the forest fund lands, which has the consequence of unlawful logging (harm) of \nforest stands [sic – sc. plantations] by third (unidentified) persons.”  \n(2) There was no suggestion that the national park had known, let alone incited or \nprocured, the illegal logging. But that did not prevent the causation element from \nhaving been satisfied; the position can only be a fortiori  where a defendant who owes \na duty to prevent harm in fact instructs others to carry out the harm. \n(3) See too the Supreme Court in Person 1 v State Treasury Service {C2/91/9}: \n“Where the unlawful conduct which created the specific possibility of causing harm \nturns it into a reality only in combination with the unlawful conduct of third persons, \na legally significant causal link must be established both with the conduct which created \nthe specific possibility (the conditions for causing harm), and with the actions which \nturned it into reality (the actual causing of harm).” \n421 Military Prosecutor’s Office {C9.9/2} was put to Mr Beketov in XX as a supposed example \nof a case in which only the last or intervening cause of harm within a sequence could satisfy \nthe test for causation {Day28/100:25} ff. In that decision, criminal investigators had \nconducted an “ investigative experiment ”, which resulted in two cars colliding with the trailer the \ninvestigators had parked across two lanes of traffic {C9.9/2/2}. The Supreme Court \nremitted the claim for retrial of the question of causation, on the basis that “[ t]he local court \n… came to a premature conclusion that only the behaviour of the investigator during the investigative \nexperience"}

But there was no suggestion that the \nretrial should involve an either/or enquiry (indeed, road traffic accidents are classic \nexamples, on Mr Alyoshin’s own evidence, of cases where joint and several liability may be \nimposed273). Moreover, the case used the same language as Person 1 v State Treasury Service \n \n272  Alyoshin1/¶252, fn. 193 {C2/1/93}; see also Beketov9/¶189 {C6/1/78}, in agreement on this point, and \nBeketov XX at {Day28/105:4-16}.  \n273  Alyoshin1/¶264 {C2/1/98}. \nAA2/15/246\n240 {C2/91/9} of harm caused by “ conduct that created the specific possibility … and … the actions that \nturned it into a reality ” {C9.9/2/10}.  \n422 Also relevant is the decision of the Kyiv Court of Appeal in Energobank {C9.12/19}, which \noverturned the first instance decision {C2/96} cited by Mr Alyoshin in his first report at \n¶255 {C2/1/94} as an example of where a causal link had not been established in a case of \nmisappropriation of funds from a bank. Despite the Court of Appeal’s decision having been \ngiven in February 2022, Mr Alyoshin identified its existence only a few days before giving \noral evidence, by way of correction to his report.274 Even then, he failed to provide a copy \nof that judgment. That omission is unsurprising, given the Court of Appeal’s findings. In \nEnergobank:  \n(1) The DGF brought an Art. 1166 CC claim against Person 1, the former chairman of \nthe board of the insolvent Energobank. Person 1 had previously been convicted of \nthe crime of neglect of official duty, on the basis that she had failed to exercise control \nover the placement of the bank’s funds on correspondent accounts with a \nLiechtenstein bank, as a result of which the funds had been stolen by third parties and \nlost {C9.12/19/2} {C9.12/19/4}. \n(2) After citing Ukoopspilka {C9.12/19/6}, the court said: \n“The Defendant did not prove that her inaction, which was expressed in the failure to take \nactions to return funds from the correspondent account of the Bank, of which she was \nthe manager, did not subsequently lead to a decrease in the liquidation estate of the Bank \nand cause damage in the amount established by the verdict.  \nThe arguments of the Defendant’s representative that the funds were transferred to the \ncorrespondent account at a time when the defendant was not the head of the bank, and \nwere also withdrawn from the account at a time when the Fund was already managing the \nbank, do not prove the absence of guilt and the absence of a direct causal connection \nbetween the inaction of the latter and the loss of funds by the bank, which, including due \nto the guilty behaviour of the defendant, which was established by the court verdict, were \nlater lost as a result of their withdrawal from the correspondent account by persons not \nidentified by the investigation.  \nIf there is a court verdict, and the defendant has been brought to criminal liability for \nneglect of duty, the defendant’s arguments and the court’s conclusions that only those \npersons who took possession of the funds can bear liability for the disappearance of the \nfunds do not correspond to the circumstances of the case and the requirements of the law, \nwhich the claimant referred to when applying to the court with a lawsuit. Since the bank’s \nloss of funds and their withdrawal from the correspondent account are also directly \ncausally related to the defendant’s omissions , as established by the court verdict.”  \n \n274  Fieldfish"}

The conclusion the court reached in that \ncase is also correct as a matter of logic, because otherwise the duties of bank officials to take \npositive steps to prevent harm to their bank would be meaningless: for example, in a case \nwhere bank officers failed to identify and prevent employees defrauding their bank,  those \nofficers could never be liable in tort if only the fraudulent employees, as the ‘last’ or ‘latest’ \ncause of the fraud, could satisfy the test of causation. In Energobank, there was no indication \nthat the former chairman had any involvement with the third parties who had stolen the \nfunds held on the correspondent accounts; the position can only be a fortiori  in cases where \nofficers were themselves the instigators of a fraud carried out on their instructions by bank \nemployees. \n424 In light of the above, it is therefore plainly not the case, as D1 suggested in his Opening, \nthat “[ i]t appears to be common ground that the standard test of causation is not satisfied by an act which \nconsists of procuring unlawful conduct by another person ”.275 This not only mischaracterises Mr \nBeketov’s opinion276 but is also flatly inconsistent with the authorities.  \n425 In Ukoopspilka, the Grand Chamber also considered arguments that the defendants should \nnot be liable for losses caused to a bank by reason of the actions of ( i) a curator from the \nNBU who had been installed in the bank from 2014 until its insolvency in 2015; and ( ii) the \nactions of the DGF itself. \n426 In relation to the curator, the defendants argued (at [7.64] {C9.8/1/36}) that “ the legitimacy \nof their actions is confirmed by the fact that the curator of the NBU worked in the bank from the second \nquarter of 2014 until the date of its insolvency, and such curator agreed to make the relevant transactions, \nindicating their legitimacy and lack of risk ”. The Grand Chamber rejected this (at [7.67] \n{C9.8/1/36}):  \n“The Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court believes that any violations by the regulator (its \nappointed curator as a representative of the NBU), improper performance of official duties \nby the bank’s curator (the curator’s reports did not contain information on the decisions made \nby the bank’s governing bodies on the purchase of bonds and information on the banks \nexpenses to pay for the purchased bonds) cannot serve as a basis for exempting the bank’s \nofficials from liability. After all, it was they, not the regulator, who made the relevant decisions \nand were responsible for the bank’s performance.” \n \n275  D1 Opening/¶268(2) {AA3/1/88}.  \n276  The extract from Beketov8/¶191 {C1/1/63} quoted at D1 Opening/¶268(2), fn. 256 {AA3/1/88}, is taken \nout of context. In that paragraph, Mr Beketov was simply discussing general propositions in relation to Art. \n1190 CC. \nAA2/15/248\n242 427 The Grand Chamber then considered whether the compensation due to the DGF should \nbe reduced by reason of the fact that it had not brought claims against the sellers of the \nworthless bonds. The court rejected this argument, stating (at [7.69]-[7.72] {C9.8/1/37}): \n“7.69.

The court rejected this argument, stating (at [7.69]-[7.72] {C9.8/1/37}): \n“7.69. The courts found that the Fund/authorized representative of the Fund did not make a \ndecision to classify the transactions as void and did not file a claim against the bond sellers for \na refund in accordance with Art. 38 of the Law of Ukraine “On the System of Guaranteeing \nthe Deposits of Individuals”. In the defendants’ view, this also demonstrates the legality of \nthe transactions and the validity of the agreements.  \n7.70. The Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court agrees that the identification of void \ntransactions and the application of the consequences of their  voidability may potentially affect \nthe total value of the liquidation estate and, accordingly, both increase and decrease the \namount of creditors’ claims not covered by the bank’s assets.  \n7.71. At the same time, according to the claimant, 109,000 bonds of LLC “Modem Financial \nPerspectives” were purchased from LLC “Nika Service Group”, which was dissolved on 7 \nDecember 2015, and 91,000 bonds of LLC “Modem Financial Perspectives” were purchased \nfrom LLC “Fininvest Perspektyva”, which was dissolved on 25 November 2015. 92,000 \nbonds of LLC “Capital Express” and 88,400 bonds of LLC “Modem Financial Perspectives” \nwere purchased from issuers, both of which, according to the claimant, had signs of \nfictitiousness, and filing claims against them would not have positive consequences, but would \nonly lead to additional expenses for legal fees.  \n7.72. The Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court notes that the failure of the Fund to take \nsuch actions, even if such a management decision was erroneous, cannot indicate the legality \nof the defendants’ actions that led the bank to insolvency and serve as a basis for exempting \nthem from liability, and also takes into account the explanations provided by the Fund, \naccording to which, within the circumstances of the case established by the courts, the \napplication of the consequences of the voidness of transactions for the purchase of bonds \ncould not significantly affect the total value of the liquidation estate and be a way to correct \nthe damage caused.” \n(5) The fourth element: fault \n428 Pursuant to Art. 1166(2) CC {C1/6/11}, fault (which can take the form of negligence or \nintent277) is presumed, and the burden of proof lies upon the defendant to establish that he \nwas not at fault (“[ t]he person who caused the harm shall be exempt from paying compensation for the \nharm if he proves that the harm was caused not through his fault ”).278 Art. 614 CC {C1/6/10} makes \nsimilar provision. As the Supreme Court put it in Bank Daniel at [214] {C2/79/45}:  \n“Thus, it was the respondents, not the claimant, who had to prove the absence of any fault \non their part before the court, that is, proving that they took all possible measures and actions \nto prevent harm to the Bank, their good faith and reasonable behaviour as managers of the \nBank.” \n \n277  For a discussion of both, see SI Invest at [48.6] {C9.13/3/21}. \n278  UkrJR/¶48 {C5/1/21}; Beketov8/¶172 {C1/1/57}. \nAA2/15/249\n243 (6) Defence to a claim in tort: embezzlement and misappropriation as exclusively \ncriminal conduct   \n429 It is common ground between the experts that a fraud involving the embezzlement or \nmisappropriation of funds could constitute a crime and be punishable as a matter of \nUkrainian criminal law.279 At points in their reports, Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida appear \n– remarkably – to suggest that this means that such conduct cannot, absent a criminal \nconviction, also be the subject of a civil law claim in tort;280 D1-2’s pleaded case, in similar \nvein, is that “ conduct which is prohibited "}

Ukrainian law instead contains one general provision on “ liability for property \ndamage ” (i.e. Art. 1166 CC {C1/6/11}), the unlawfulness element of which can be \nsatisfied by breach of any provision of Ukrainian law. \n(2) The same factual allegations of misconduct against a defendant are perfectly capable \nof giving rise to both liability for the offences of misappropriation and/or \nembezzlement under the Criminal Code and civilly unlawful conduct capable of \nfounding an Art. 1166 CC claim.283 As Mr Alyoshin acknowledges, “[ i]f on the facts while \ncommitting misappropriation, the defendants also breached their fiduciary duties or another civil law \nduty, the breach of duty could itself give rise to a tort claim ”.284 Indeed, the very fact that \nUkrainian (civil) law contains a general prohibition on “ ownership deprivation ” under Art. \n3(1) CC {C1/6/1} only reinforces this conclusion.285 See also the decisions of the \n \n279  UkrJR/¶38.1 {C5/1/18}.  \n280  UkrJR/¶39 {C5/1/18}; Alyoshin1/¶231 {C2/1/86}; Nahnybida3/¶66 {C4/1/11}; Nahnybida4/¶31 \n{C9/1/6}, ¶34 {C9/1/7}.  \n281  D1Def/¶59(4) {A1/8/34]; D2Def/¶37(2) {A1/18/20}; D2 Opening/¶261 {AA4/1/102}, ¶270 \n{AA4/1/107}. \n282  UkrJR/¶38 {C5/1/18}. \n283  Beketov11/¶¶12-15 {C9.2/1/5}. \n284  Alyoshin2/¶121 {C7/1/45}; see also UkrJR/¶39.2 {C5/1/18}: “ In appropriate cases, the defendant will be liable in \ntort to the extent that his or her conduct violates rules or prohibitions applicable to that defendant ”. \n285  See Beketov9/¶166 {C6/1/64}. \nAA2/15/250\n244 Grand Chamber in Pandeon {C6/4/430} at [5.30] and the Supreme Court in Peasant \nFarm ‘Ukraine’ (which cites Pandeon), at [84]-[86] {C9.8/49.1/11}.286 \n431 The position is a fortiori  in the case of D3-8: it is common ground between Mr Beketov and \nMr Nahnybida that, under Ukrainian criminal law only natural persons, not legal entities, can \nbe prosecuted for a crime.287 As Mr Beketov points out, if it were really the case that no tort \nclaim could be brought for factual allegations of misappropriation or embezzlement absent \na criminal conviction, “ the nonsensical outcome ” would be that “ a legal entity could never be held \ntortiously liable for misappropriation or embezzlement ”.288  Mr Nahnybida’s belated attempts (having \nconceded that companies cannot be held criminally liable) instead to suggest that a legal \nentity must be held vicariously liable for the criminal offences of an employee before any \nclaim under Art. 1166 CC can be brought against it is not only unsupported by any authority \nbut is also obviously wrong;289 indeed, even he acknowledged that vicarious liability “ is one \nthing and a completely different thing is that the employees or officers of the legal entities are guilty in crimi"}

That point can be illustrated by \nconsidering a scenario in which the only employee of a company involved in a \nmisappropriation or embezzlement dies before a criminal conviction can be sought or \nobtained against him; in such a scenario, on Mr Nahnybida’s analysis, that company can \nnever be held tortiously liable. \n(7) Defence to a claim in tort: competition of claims   \n432 Two sets of contracts are alleged by Ds to preclude the Bank’s tortious claims against them:  \n(1) In respect of D1-2, employment or service contracts between them and the Bank. \n(2) In respect of all Ds, the Relevant Loans between the Bank and the Borrowers.290 \n433 Neither provides any basis for rejecting the Bank’s claim. Addressing each in turn: \n(a) Employment/service contracts \n434 The first, and short, answer to this argument is a factual one: no contract between the Bank \nand D1 or D2 has been disclosed by any party (despite the Bank having conducted specific \nsearches for such documents). Nor does either D1 or D2 identify any specific provision of \n \n286  The Bank’s translation, at {C9.8/49.1/11}, is in this particular instance to be preferred to D3-8’s translation \nat {C9.6/4/31} – the language is clearer. \n287  Beketov12/¶¶18-20 {C9.4/1/7}; Nahnybida5/¶44 {C9.6/1/16}.  \n288  Beketov12/¶26 {C9.4/1/10}.  \n289  Nahnybida5/¶¶50-55 {C9.6/1/18}; see also Beketov XX {Day29/92:4-24}; Nahnybida XX {Day32/117:21} \n- {Day32/118:17}. \n290  D1Def/¶60(2)(a) {A1/8/34}, ¶¶74-75A {A1/8/43}; D2Def/¶44 {A1/18/25}, ¶¶53-53A {A1/18/27}; D2 \nOpening/¶303-304 {AA4/1/120}; D3-8 Opening/¶9(d) {AA5/1/9}, ¶72(a) {AA5/1/36}. \nAA2/15/251\n245 such putative contracts that would preclude a claim in tort.291  Since the experts are agreed \nthat “ each party generally bears the burden of proving facts and matters upon which they wish to rely ”,292 \nthe argument ends there. \n435 But even if such contract(s) did exist, they would not preclude the Bank’s tortious claims: \n(1) It is common ground between Mr Beketov and Mr Alyoshin that “ a tort claim under \nArticle 1166 can be brought against an officer or employee of a company where the employee’s unlawful \nconduct amounts to a breach of that officer or employee’s duties under the Civil Code or the JSC Law \nor the Law on Banks ”.293  In consequence, there should be no dispute that, insofar as \nthe Bank’s Art. 1166 claim is based on breach of fiduciary duty, it could be brought \neven if there were a contract of employment/services between the Bank and D1/D2. \n(2) It is further common ground that “ if a bank’s executive /officer breaches duties that go beyond \nthe scope of those created by his contract of employment or contract for services, the bank can pursue \nremedies against them in tort ”: UkrJR/¶96.1 {C5/1/38}.  \n(3) There are a plethora of Supreme Court cases in which an individual’s status as an \nexecutive or officer was treated as distinct from, and as having priority over, their \nstatus as an employee: see, for example, Medilabs at [89] {C9.12/5/20} (which Mr \nAlyoshin agreed contained a correct statement of Ukrainian law: {Day32/26:17} - \n{Day32/27:17});294  Ukoopspilka {C2/82},295 Energobank at {C9.12/19/7} (fourth \nparagraph from bottom) and Person 2 v Trading House Homelsklo-Ukraina \n{C9.8/15/3}.296 \n(b) The Relevant Loans \n436 The existence of purported loan agreements between the Bank and the Borrowers ( i.e. the \nRelevant Loans) in no way precludes its claims i"}

That \n \n291  Compare Alyoshin1/¶38 {C2/1/15}: “ the Bank’s claims against the First and Second Defendants will be subject to the \nterms of any contracts it had with them … including any limitations on the Defendant’s liability … ”.  \n292  UkrJR/¶105.1 {C5/1/41}. \n293  UkrJR/¶96.2 {C5/1/38}. \n294  Decision of the Supreme Court dated 17.8.23 in Case No. 902/183/22. \n295  In which four judges out of the 18-panel Grand Chamber issued a dissenting opinion on this specific issue \n{C1/142}. As Mr Beketov observes, “ the existence of this dissenting opinion removes any doubt as to … whether the bank \nexecutives in that case … had employments/service contracts with the bank, and if so whether this was a relevant factor to be \ntaken into account ”: Beketov9/¶365 {C6/1/141}. \n296  Decision of the Supreme Court dated 7.2.18 in Case No. 711/5711/16-ts. \nAA2/15/252\n246 opportunity is subject simply to the uncontroversial caveat that “[ t]he realisation of one of these \nrights leads to the termination of the other ”, i.e. the claimant may not double recover.297 That \nreasoning accords, and gives effect to, the general principle of full compensation for tortious \nloss: the (thoroughly unmeritorious) upshot of Ds’ argument (assuming the Relevant Loans \nto be valid, which, for the reasons given in Section J1 , they are not) is that the Bank should \nbe limited to bringing debt or restitutionary claims against the worthless vehicles of fraud, \nand cannot pursue the guiding minds of the wrongdoing.  \n438 Secondly, Mr Alyoshin acknowledges that, where there is a contract between the claimant \nand a third party but the tortious claim against the defendant is one for breach of fiduciary \nduty, “[ s]uch claims may be brought even where the harm caused to the claimant arises from non-performance \nof the contract with a third party ”.298 That acknowledgement is clearly correct, given the cases in \nwhich the DGF has pursued tortious claims against former officers of insolvent banks in \nexpress reliance upon the bank’s entry into loan agreements or purchase of securities ( e.g. as \nUkoopspilka {C9.8/1}, Bank Daniel {C2/79} and Trust Bank {C9.8/30}). \n439 Accordingly, D1 was right to concede at D1 Opening/¶250 {AA3/1/82} that “ a claim in tort \nwill not be barred by the rule against competition of claims if the defendant is an officer or employee of a \ncompany and the claim is based on a breach of the defendant’s duties to the company under the civil Code or \nother specific legislation. The competition of claims point therefore only raises if the Bank fails to establish \nthat there has been such a breach of duty ”. Mr Alyoshin agreed with this proposition in XX: \n{Day32/23:17-20}. \n440 Thirdly, and regardless of whether or not the Art. 1166 claim is founded upon breach of \nfiduciary duty, there can be no competition of claims issue if the contract between claimant \nand third party is void. Mr Alyoshin’s suggestion299 that, in this scenario, the claimant is \nconfined to a restitutionary claim under Art. 216 CC should be firmly rejected:  \n(1) Art. 216, by its own clear words, provides for the consequences of invalidity as against \na party to the "}

Mr Alyoshin tried to suggest that, \neven had the contracts been found to be void, “ it doesn’t change anything ” {Day32/21:3-\n8}. That ignored, however, the fact that the Supreme Court observed in each case that \nthe “ contracts had not been invalidated, and hence there was no reason to consider them void ”.300  \n441 Fourthly, it is clearly established in the authorities that, even where there is a contract (not \nalleged to be invalid) between claimant and defendant, a non-contractual claim is not \nexcluded if “ the harm caused by one party to the other is not connected with the performance of an obligation \narising out of the contract ”.301 The position is a fortiori  where the contract is between the claimant \nand a third party – and, indeed, there are multiple examples in the authorities of precisely \nthis scenario. See, for example:   \n(1) Ukreximbank {C3/12}:302 a bank was persuaded to lend money to a company, secured \nby a pledge, on the basis of forged documents making it appear as though the pledge \nconstituted adequate security. Person 6 (the director of the pledgor, who had procured \nthe creation of the forged documents) and Person 7 (the accountant of the pledgor, \nwho had produced the forged documents at Person 6’s request) were found jointly \nand severally liable in tort (the relevant unlawful conduct being their earlier criminal \nconvictions for forgery).

Accordingly, no competition of claims defence can arise in relation \nto the Bank’s tortious claims against D1-2 to the extent that their unlawful conduct \nconsists of breach of such duty. \n(3) Furthermore, the Bank’s claims in tort (as against all Ds) are not precluded by the \nRelevant Loans because ( i) the claims are not “ connected with the performance of an obligation \narising out of the contract ” – the Bank does not sue to recover unpaid debts, but rather to \ncompensate it for the massive fraud perpetrated against it; and ( ii) there is neither a \ncontractual nor a restitutionary claim against the (shell company) Borrowers that \nprecludes the Bank’s Art. 1166 claim. \n(8) Remedies under Art. 1166  \n443 Art. 22(1) CC {C1/6/2} states that “[ a] person who has suffered damage as a result of violation of his \ncivil right has the right to compensation ”. Pursuant to Art. 22(3), “[ d]amages are fully reimbursed if the \nagreement or the law does not provide for compensation in a smaller or larger amount ”. The notion of \n‘full compensation’ is also reflected in Art. 1166(1) {C1/6/11} (“ shall be compensated in full ”) \nand Art. 1192 {C1/6/13} (“ compensate for the damage caused in full ”).304 \n444 Subject to that requirement, quantification of loss is a question of fact, which falls to be \nconsidered alongside issues of causation: Beketov8/¶109 {C1/1/37}. Ukrainian law does \nnot have detailed legal principles governing matters such as remoteness or credit for benefits \nreceived; these are left to the court to resolve in evaluating what loss has, in fact, been \nsuffered by the claimant. These points are addressed further below. \n \n304  See also UkrJR/¶50.1 {C5/1/22}: “ The experts agree that … the remedies available for tort claims under Article 1166 \ninclude … compensation or damages in full ”. \nAA2/15/255\n249 (9) Joint and several liability under Art. 1190(1) CC \n445 Art. 1190 CC {C1/6/12} provides that “[ p]ersons by whose joint actions or failure to act harm was \ncaused shall bear joint and several responsibility to the victim ”. \n446 There has been disagreement between the experts as to whether ( i) as Ds’ experts contend, \nall elements of a claim in Arts. 1166 CC must be satisfied as against each defendant separately \nbefore Art. 1190 CC is engaged; or ( ii) as Mr Beketov contends, in cases where there are \nmultiple defendants, the element of causation is assessed collectively.305  \n447 In practical terms, this debate may be of limited relevance.

As Mr Nahnybida acknowledges, \n“[i]t is difficult to isolate the factual conduct of all of the defendants when the court deals with application of \nArticle 1190 to one of the defendants. The court does not ignore the actions of the other defendants (as if \nthose actions never happened) ”.306 Reflecting this, the authorities repeatedly show that the \nSupreme Court can and does consider causation as against all defendants taken together. \nThus, for example: \n(1) In the DTEK case {C9.8/32}, a minority shareholder brought a claim against the \ncompany (DTEK Dniproenergo) and the majority shareholder (DTEK Power Trade), \nalleging that his shares had been bought out by an affiliate of the majority shareholder \nat an artificially low value. The majority shareholder said that causation could not be \nestablished against it. At [5.21]-[5.23] {C9.8/32/15}, the Supreme Court said: \n“5.21 The Supreme Court rejects the objections of defendant 1 that in this case there \nis no such element of the offense as a causal link between the unlawful behavior of \nLLC “DTEK Power Trade” and the damage caused, and in accordance with the \ngrounds of claim identified by the claimant, the proper defendant is JSC “DTEK \nDniproenergo”, which is consistent with the conclusion of the Supreme Court in case \nNo. 905/1926/18. \n5.22 The Supreme Court takes into account that the market value of the shares was \napproved by the company’s Supervisory Board. At the same time, the court also takes \ninto account that the joint stock company is controlled by LLC “DTEK Power Trade”, \nwhich, together with its affiliates, holds the dominant controlling stake; the squeeze-\nout procedure was carried out in the interests of the latter; the members of the \nSupervisory Board who approved the price are representatives of the majority \nshareholder; the person making the demand failed to perform the actions provided for \nin Article 65-1 of the Law of Ukraine “On Joint Stock Companies”.  \n5.23 Thus, in this case, the claimant suffered damages due to the interrelated combined \nactions of the Supervisory Board of the joint stock company and the person making \nthe demand with the unity of intent – to buy out the shares from the claimant at a \nunderstated price.

One of the defendants, Person 5, had been found guilty in \nprior criminal proceedings of handling stolen goods ( i.e. his involvement was not \napparently with the initial theft, but only with the subsequent receipt of the stolen \nproperty308); his appeal to challenge his joint and several liability was rejected. The \nHigh Specialised Court,309 noting that, for Art. 1190 to be engaged, “[ i]t is not necessary \nthat the actions or omissions that caused harm to others must coincide in time ”,310 said at \n{C3/20/3}: \n“According to the above-mentioned Ruling of the High Civil and Criminal Court of \nUkraine PERSON 5 in December 2006 designedly knowing thar the funds in the \namount of UAH 960,000, which were transferred to him by a person against whom a \ncriminal case has been singled out into a separate proceeding were stolen and belong \nto Subsidiary Company Gaz Ukrainy of National Joint Stock Company Naftogaz of \nUkraine, guided by a selfish motive, receive"}

If liability under Art. 1190 extends to situations \nwhere it is “ impossible to determine what action and to what extent caused ” the harm, then it would \nseem that the element of causation must be considered collectively. \n450 What the experts do agree on is that, if Art. 1190(1) is engaged, its effect is that “ each of the \nco-defendants must compensate the full amount of damages suffered by the aggrieved party (as opposed to \ncompensating the victim only for the share of harm directly attributable to their own unlawful conduct) ”.313  \nThus a defendant who may, if considered alone, have only himself have caused a proportion \nof the overall loss suffered by the claimant may be held liable to compensate for the whole.  \n451 Although Mr Marchukov suggested in his reports that ‘unity of intent’ under Art. 1190(1) \n“is a high bar ”, and that he was “ not aware of any purely civil cases [as opposed to cases based \nupon prior criminal verdicts]  where the court has explained how the ‘unity of intent’ indicator can be \nestablished; nor am I aware of any case (purely civil ones) where it has been so established ”,314 that opinion \noverlooked the DTEK case {C9.8/32/15}, where the Supreme Court said at [5.23] – in a \nwholly civil context – that:  \n“Thus, in this case, the claimant suffered damages due "}

In that case, the claimants (Persons 1-3) sued their neighbour (Person 4), \nalleging that she had incited three minors (Persons 6, 7 and 9) to destroy a security camera \nthey had put up outside their property {C8/3/2}. However, the court found that “ Person_4 \n… asked the boys to turn away the neighbour’s surveillance camera, which was directed onto their yard. \nPERSON_6 climbed the fence and began to turn the camera away. As a result, the camera mount cracked \nand the camera itself fell on the owner’s yard ” {C8/3/5}. The court expressly declined to hold that \nPerson 4 was an “ accomplice ” of Person 6, and further refused to overturn the lower court’s \nfinding that Person 6 had destroyed the camera negligently, rather than deliberately \n{C8/3/7}. This was therefore a case where ( i) there was no finding of intentional harm by \nany defendant; and ( ii) there was no allegation, let alone finding, that, by asking Person 6 to \nturn the camera away (rather than destroy it), Person 4 had committed any unlawful act. \nQuite aside from the fact that the decision is not Supreme Court authority, the case is \ntherefore not “ inconsistent with the suggestion that a person who procures somebody else to commit an \nunlawful act can be deemed to have caused the loss jointly with that person ”.317  \nI3 UKRAINIAN LAW OF INVALIDITY OF CONTRACT  \n(1) Overview \n454 Under Art. 215 CC (“ Invalidity of a transaction ”) {C1/6/5}, there are two types of invalid \ntransactions:318  \n(1) A ‘void’ transaction is invalid ab inito  by operation of law. Pursuant to Art. 215(2), “ such \ntransaction is not required to be held invalid by court ”. \n(2) A ‘voidable’ transaction is one which “ is not expressly held invalid by law ”, but which may \nbe held invalid by the court: Art. 215(3). Should the court make such a finding, the \ntransaction will be invalid ab initio , rather than from the moment of the court’s \ndeclaration.  \n455 Pursuant to Art. 216 CC {"}

That was the allegation advanced by the claimant (which was \nrejected): compare {C8/3/2} (third paragraph down) and {C8/3/5} (second paragraph).  \n318  UkrJR/¶5 {C5/1/5}. \nAA2/15/259\n253 consequence “ connected with [a transaction’s ] invalidity ” is mutual restitution or, in the event that \nthat is impossible, compensation for value received.319 \n456 Ukrainian law contains a variety of provisions, in both the CC and other statutes, stipulating \nspecified circumstances in which transactions will be invalid. The key provisions, for the \npurposes of the Bank’s claim, are summarised below. \n(2) Article 228 CC \n457 Art. 228 {C1/6/6} provides as follows: \n“1. A transaction is to be considered to be contrary to the public policy, provided that it was \naimed at (i) violating constitutional human and civil rights and freedoms, or (ii) destructing or \ndamaging or misappropriating any property of a company or individual or the state or the \nAutonomous Republic of Crimea or a legal community.  \n2. A transaction that is contrary to the public policy is void.  \n3. In the event of failure to satisfy the requirement that a transaction must meet state or public \ninterests or public morals, such transaction may be held invalid. Where a transaction that has \nbeen held invalid by court was executed with an aim that was knowingly in conflict with state \nor public interests, then, if it was the intention of the parties (provided that such transaction \nwas carried out by both parties), the court must order that everything they have received under \nsuch transaction be transferred to the state budget or, if the transaction was carried out by \none party, the court must order that everything the other party has received be transferred to \nthe state budget and that everything the other party owes be transferred to the former party \nby court judgment as a recovery for everything so received. Where it was the intention of one \nparty only, everything such party has received under such transaction must be returned to the \nother party, and everything that has been received by, or owed to, the latter must be \ntransferred to the state budget by court judgment. ” \n458 Transactions that are “ considered to be ” (i.e. deemed) contrary to public policy, pursuant to Art. \n228(1), are thus void under Art. 228(2). Transactions that contravene state interests or public \nmorals are voidable under Art. 228(3). \n459 It is common ground between the experts (and was established by the Supreme Court in \nChornomornaftogaz {C1/135}320) that “ whether a transaction violates public policy is determined on \na case-by-case basis ”.321 It is also common ground that, in order to be contrary to public policy, \nit is “ necessary for one or more of the parties to have known (actually or constructively) that the transaction \nwas contrary to public policy and to have intended or willingly accepted those harmful effects ”;322 the test \nthus focuses upon the aim of the transaction.323 Mr Alyoshin has observed that applying this \n \n319  UkrJR/¶5.7 {C5/1/5}. \n320  Decision of the Supreme Court dated 7.10.20 in Case No. 911/2574/18. \n321  UkrJR/¶11.2 {C5/1/8}; "}

His argument – in any of its varying forms – should be \nrejected: Ukrainian law does not require proof of a criminal verdict in order for a transaction \nto be contrary to public policy. The reality – as the Supreme Court has clearly articulated – \nis that, while it is possible for a criminal verdict to form the basis of a finding of violation of \npublic policy, it is also open to the fact-finding court to assess for itself whether or not the \nevidence establishes a violation of public policy. Further and in any event, any such \nrequirement is a matter of evidence and procedure, and accordingly an issue for the lex fori  \n(English law – which imposes no such condition) rather than the lex causae  (Ukrainian law).  \n(a) No need for criminal verdict as a matter of Ukrainian law  \n(i) Grand Chamber decisions \n462 The starting point is the position of the Grand Chamber, the decisions of which, it is \ncommon ground, “ carry more weight than those of the other chambers ” (or, in Mr Alyoshin’s own \nwords, impose “ certain obligation to follow that ”).328  On this issue, there are two Grand Chamber \n \n324  Alyoshin2/¶146 {C7/1/52}.  \n325  UkrJR/¶12 {C5/1/8}.  \n326  Alyoshin2/¶180 {C7/1/62}.  \n327  Alyoshin XX {Day31/20:15} - {Day31/21:9}; {Day31/30:3-16}; {Day31/61:9-17}. \n \n328  UkrJR/¶3.3 {C5/1/4}; Alyoshin XX {Day30/139:11-13}; {Day31/23:15} - {Day31/24:19}.

At \n[124] {C9.8/25/30}, it determined as follows:333 \n“Since the sale and purchase contract was concluded without taking into account the \ninterests of the heirs of the deceased PERSON_7 and was aimed at illegally seizing the \nlatter’s shares in the charter capital of PE Agrofirma Slavutych, this contract, in the part \nof the terms on the disposal by PERSON_4 of the share in the charter capital of the \nenterprise inherited by the claimants (60% of the charter capital) is void in accordance \nwith parts one and two of Article 228 of the Civil Code of Ukraine … “ \n \n329  Decision of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court dated 2.11.21 in Case No. 917/1338/18.  \n330  Decision of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court dated 12.10.21 in Case No. 910/17324/19. \n331  Beketov9/¶¶72 {C6/1/29}; Beketov11/¶31 {C9.2/1/10}.  \n332  Alyoshin XX {Day31/43:11-15}; see also {Day31/36:14} - {Day31/37:9}. \n333  The Claimants’ claim for a declaration of invalidity was actually rejected, because the share purchase agreement \nwas void, pursuant to Art. 228(2) CC, by operation of law, such that “ it is not necessary that the court should recognize \nthis transaction invalid ”: see [118], [122]-[123] {C9.8/25/29-30}. \nAA2/15/262\n256 464 As is plain from ¶124 of the judgment, the impugned share purchase agreement was held by \nthe Grand Chamber to have violated public policy, so as to be void under Art. 228(2) CC, \nbecause it was “ aimed at illegally seizing ” the heirs’ shares in the company, i.e. it was a \nmisappropriation (of shares) case. Mr Alyoshin agreed with this proposition, but \nnevertheless refused to agree that the decision represented Ukrainian law on Art. 228(1)-\n(2).334 His reasons were not only spurious but factually wrong: \n(1) Mr Alyoshin went to great lengths to suggest that the Grand Chamber’s decision was \n“so much controversial ” and “ highly criticised in the legal community ”, and further made the \nsurprising suggestion that it was the subject of dissenting opinions by “ at least half of \nthe judges ”.335 That was wishful thinking on his part. Quite aside from the fact that it \nhas been recently cited by the Supreme Court in another Art. 228 case (as to which \nsee further below), the dissenting opinions Mr Alyoshin mentioned for the first time \nin XX – which were located, translated and added to the trial bundle by the Bank \novernight, rather than being provided by Mr Alyoshin o"}

Quite aside from the fact that it \nhas been recently cited by the Supreme Court in another Art. 228 case (as to which \nsee further below), the dissenting opinions Mr Alyoshin mentioned for the first time \nin XX – which were located, translated and added to the trial bundle by the Bank \novernight, rather than being provided by Mr Alyoshin or D1 – in fact did not take \nissue with the Grand Chamber’s decision to find the share purchase agreement void \nin the absence of a criminal conviction.336 Despite professing to having read the \ndissents when asked about them the following morning, Mr Alyoshin nevertheless \nrefused to accept this proposition.337 \n(2) Mr Alyoshin’s further attempt to distinguish the case, and the absence of a criminal \nverdict, on the basis that “ illegality was arising from the breach of the corporate regulations. It \nwas not misappropriation, emebezzlement, fraud, whatever. So that’s how I see it, a little bit \ndifferent ”338 was patent nonsense, and yet another example of his attempt to dismiss \nany case that did not support the position for which he wished to advocate on behalf \nof D1. \n465 In the second of the Grand Chamber decisions, MTIBU v Alfa-Garant: \n(1) The MTIBU (the Ukrainian motor insurance bureau, and insurer-of-last-resort) made \na payout to a victim following a road traffic accident, in the mistaken belief that the \n \n334  Alyoshin XX {Day31/41:2} - {Day31/43:5}. \n335  Alyoshin XX {Day31/41:2-6}; {Day31/36:16} - {Day31/37:3}; {Day31/41:22} - {Day31/42:15}; \n{Day31/56:13} - {Day31/57:9}. \n336  Two of the dissenting opinions were concerned solely with the corporate law question of whether the heirs \nhad become members in the enterprise: see {C9.12/21/3}; {C9.12/22/8}. The third opinion dissented both \non this basis (¶¶25 ff {C9.12/20/3}) and on the basis that, as a matter of corporate law, the heirs’ ownership \nof the shares had been terminated and replaced by a claim for the value of the shares, such that the share \npurchase agreement had not in fact alienated the heirs’ shares (¶¶92-93 {C9.12/20/7}).  \n337  Alyoshin XX {Day32/50:9} - {Day32/51:17}. \n338  Alyoshin XX {Day31/42:16} - {Day31/43:5}. \nAA2/15/263\n257 driver was uninsured. It subsequently learnt that the driver in fact had an insurance \npolicy, and sought reimbursement from the insurer, Alfa-Garant. The Grand Chamber \nwas asked to consider whether the MTIBU was entitled to make such a claim, and (in \nparticular), whether it was also entitled to reimbursement of the deductible: [1]-[3] \n{C9.8/46.1/2}.  \n(2) That MTIBU relied upon a cooperation agreement in place between it and Alfa-\nGarant, which, it said, entitled it to recovery of the entirety of the proceeds paid out, \nincluding the deductible: [57] {C9.8/46.1/10}. The Grand Chamber (which was \nexpressly asked to consider the relevance of the cooperation agreement: see [3(5)] \n{C9.8/46.1/2}) found that it was void under Art. 228(1)-(2) CC. At [62] \n{C9.8/46.1/10}, it said: \n“The conclusion of a cooperation agreement is a condition for the insurer to become \na member of the Motor (Transport) Insurance Bureau of Ukraine (paragraph three of \nClause 51.1 of Article 51 of Law No. 1961-IV). Therefore, such an agreement can only \ncontain conditions for cooperation with regard to internal insurance contracts, since \nthis is precisely what Law No. 1961-IV requires. The conditions under which the \ninsurer must reimburse the Motor (Transport) Insurance Bureau of Ukraine for its \nexpenses, if they are not provided for by law, are not conditions of cooperation, but \nare aimed at illegal possession of the insurer’s property .

Mr Alyoshin (grudgingly) accepted the judgment as a decision of the \nGrand Chamber, but again resorted to his familiar refrain that it was “ case specific ” and \n“irrelevant ”.339 \n(ii) Supreme Court authority following the Grand Chamber \n467 There is very recent Supreme Court authority, again a misappropriation case, that expressly \nadopts and follows the reasoning of the Grand Chamber in Agrofirma Slavutych, and again \nmakes a finding of violation of public policy without any prior criminal verdict. In Tigerfish \nv Free Energy (June 2023) {C9.12/3}:340 \n \n339  Alyoshin XX {Day31/45:24} - {Day31/46:17}. \n340  Decision of the Supreme Court dated 20.6.23 in Case No. 924/588/20.  \nAA2/15/264\n258 (1) A company was 99% owned by Free Energy, which was in turn owned 50/50 by \nPersons 1 and 3. The remaining 1% shareholding was owned by Person 2, the director \nof the company: [4]-[6] {C9.12/3/15}. \n(2) By the use of forged minutes purportedly signed by Person 1, Person 3 procured the \nsale of Free Energy’s 99% shareholding in the company to Free Energy Investment, \nof which he was the sole beneficial owner ([12]-[20] {C9.12/3/15}). \n(3) Having referred to Art. 228(1)-(2), and the Grand Chamber’s resolution in Agrofirma \nSlavutych ([94]-[95] {C9.12/3/26}), the Court said at [95] {C9.12/3/26}: \n“The Supreme Court, taking into account the established circumstances and the above \nconclusions of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court, agrees with the conclusions \nof the court of appeal that the sale and purchase agreement was concluded by \nPERSON_3 in excess of his authority … and is aimed solely at exercising \nPERSON_3’s own interests (the acquirer is a legal entity of which PERSON_3 is the \nbeneficial owner) … Pursuant to parts 1 and 2, Article 228 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, \nthe established circumstances are the basis for recognising the agreement as void as \naimed at the illegal takeover by PERSON_3 of property of FREE ENERGY LLC \n(a share in the charter capital of the Enterprise) in his own interests and in the absence \nof the will of FREE ENERGY LLC …” \n468 Mr Alyoshin agreed in XX that “ on those facts, that’s an allegation of misappropriation of shares ”.341 \n(iii) Supreme Court authorities that criminal verdict sufficient but not necessary \n469 There are a plethora of statements in Supreme Court cases that state that a criminal verdict, \nwhile sufficient to form the basis of a finding of violation of public policy, is not an exclusive \nor necessary requirement. That principle was clearly articulated in Kakhovka Prom-Agro \n(October 2019) {C9.8/46.01},342 in which the claimant contended that a lease agreement \nbetween Misto Bank and Kakhovka Protein Agro was void pursuant to Art. 228(1)-(2), \nbecause the leased soybean processing plant in fact belonged to it, and not to Misto Bank \n(the purported lessor). The lower courts agreed with the claimant; Misto Bank appealed to \nthe Supreme Court on the basis, inter alia , of “ the absence of a court verdict against the parties to this \nAgreement or other evidence of guilt or intent ” {C9.8/46.01/3}. On this argument, the Supreme \nCourt said at {C9.8/46.01/5} that: \n“By singling out a transaction that violates p"}

On this argument, the Supreme \nCourt said at {C9.8/46.01/5} that: \n“By singling out a transaction that violates public order as a separate type of void transactions, \nthe Civil Code of Ukraine proceeds from the content of the illegal act itself and its danger to \nthe interests of the state and society in general, as well as the significance of the violated \ninterests as a result of the commission of such a transaction.  \n \n341  Alyoshin XX {Day31/54:17-19}. \n342  Decision of the Supreme Court dated 17.10.19 in Case No. 910/11033/18. \nAA2/15/265\n259 When qualifying the transaction under Article 228 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, it is necessary \nto take into account guilt expressed in the intention to violate public order by the parties to \nthe transaction or one of the parties.  \nArticle 228  of the Civil Code of Ukraine does not stipulate  that the evidence of guilt must \nnecessarily be a court verdict in a criminal case , and that the presence of intent (guilt in \nthe form of intent) or the intention of the parties cannot be established by the court in \nany other way and with other evidence, including in the course of the consideration \nof the commercial case.   \nThe question of whether an illegal act took place and whether it was committed by the relevant \nperson, as well as the direction of the person’s intention, can also be proved by other evidence \navailable in the case file in their totality, taking into account the requirements defined by the \nprocedural law.”  \n470 Mr Alyoshin (for once) said that he agreed with the Supreme Court’s interpretation of Art. \n228 “[ i]n this case, yes ”,343 but sought to distinguish the decision apparently on the basis that \nit concerned “ normal contractual relations ”, rather than misappropriation.344 But that simply \nignored the fact that the reasoning of the Supreme Court in dismissing Misto Bank’s appeal, \nas set out at {C9.8/46.01/6-7}, was expressly predicated upon the fact that the soybean \nplant “ was removed from the possession of Kakhovka Prom-Agro LLC against its will ” and that “ the \nagreement violates the public order, since such a transaction undermines the basis of the national economy \nregarding the inviolability of right to private property … ”. \n471 In a similar vein, three out of the four cases cited by Mr Alyoshin at Alysohin2/¶180 \n{C7/1/62}345 in support of his argument that a criminal verdict was necessary in fact used \nsimilar language to Kakhovka Prom-Agro. Thus in Person 1 v Persons 2-3 (June 2019),346 \nthe Supreme Court said at {C7/60/8} that “[ w]hen qualifying a transaction under Article 228 of \nthe Civil Code of Ukraine, it is necessary to take into account the fault, which is expressed in the intention \nof a party or parties to the transaction to violate the public order. Proof of the fault may be  the court sentence \nin a criminal case concerning destruction of property, damage to the property, illegal appropriation thereof, \netc”. That formulation was repeated (with slight variations in translation) in Person 1 v \nPerson 2 (October 2019) {C7/58/7}347 and Person 1 v Persons 2-4 (January 2021) at \n{C7/61/6}.348 It also features in two other cases cited by Mr Alysohin, Emselba v Rolon \n \n343  Alyoshin XX {Day31/29:21} - {Day31/30:2}. \n344  Alyoshin XX {Day31/34:11} - {Day31/35:3}. \n345  The fourth is Ant Yapi, discussed below. \n346  Decision of the Supreme Court dated 26.6.19 in Case No. 639/10105/15-ts. \n347  Decision of the Supreme Court dated 31.10.19 in Case No. 461/5273/16. \n348  Decision of the Supreme Court dated 25.1.21 in Case No. 643/10217/16-ts. \nAA2/15/266\n260 (July"}

The Supreme Court rejected the Inspectorate’s claim, \nsaying the following at {C7/59/5}:  \n“When qualifying transaction under Article 228 of the Civil Code of Ukraine it should take \ninto account the fault expressed in an intent to violate the public policy (as to destruction, \ndamage to property or misappropriation thereof, etc.) by the parties thereto or by one of the \nparties thereto, which should be established only by a court judgment in a criminal case, which \nis in line with part one of Article 62 of the Constitution of Ukraine. \nThe Supreme Court agrees with the conclusions as made by the courts of previous instances \nthat tax evasion (unreasonable formulation of gross costs and tax credit amounts and VAT \nliabilities), on which circumstances the Claimant refers to as the basis for allowing claims, is a \ncrime, the liability for which is established by the Criminal Code of Ukraine, and therefore \nunder the circumstances existing in this case , the definition of a transaction as violating \nthe public policy should be preceded by a court judgment on bringing the participant \n(participants/contractors) of such a transaction to criminal liability, which would take legal \neffect.” \n473 The differences between Ant Yapi and the other cases discussed above are clear from a plain \nreading of the judgment. The Inspectorate’s assertion that the lease agreement failed to \nsatisfy public morals, such as to be voidable under Art. 228(3), was based entirely upon an \nallegation of criminal tax evasion (which has no civil law analogue352); however, the evidence \nit relied upon in support of that assertion was solely the fruits of its own investigation into \nthose allegations of tax evasion {C7/59/3-4}. In those circumstances, it was unsurprising \nthat the Supreme Court considered that the Inspectorate’s claim could not succeed in the \nabsence of a criminal verdict. \n474 The judgment of the Supreme Court in Bank Concord (August 2023) {C9.12/6}353 – which, \nas an aside, was identified and disclosed by Mr Beketov pursuant to his duty as an \n \n349  Decision of the Supreme Court dated 2.7.20 in Case No. 910/4932/19. \n350  Decision of the Supreme Cout dated 8.12.21 in Case No. 911/2574/18. \n351  Decision of the Supreme Court dated 8.8.19 in Case No. 2a-12868/12/2670. \n352  Alyoshin XX {Day31/50:22} - {Day31/52:8}; see also Beketov11/¶¶23-30 {C9.2/1/8}. \n353  Decision of the Supreme Court dated 17.8.23 in Case No. 904/3100/21 {C9.12/6}.  \nAA2/15/267\n261 independent expert, and not (in contrast to Mr Alyoshin) someone who was ‘flying a kite’ \nfor his client354 – is on all fours with Ant Yapi: \n(1) The Institution, a state body charged with promoting innovation within Ukraine \n{C9.12/6/21}, advanced a loan to Ukrderzhtsyfra, guaranteed by Bank Concord. \nUpon Ukrderzhtsyfra defaulting on its obligations, the Institution sought to enforce \nthe guarantee against Bank Concord.

In response, Bank Concord contended that the \nguarantee, and the underlying loan, were invalid, inter alia  on public policy grounds \n{C9.12/6/14}. \n(2) The Institution relied upon a report it had made to the police, which concerned \nallegations that its former chairman (Person 2) had committed criminal offences under \nthe Budget and Criminal Codes {C9.12/6/21}. Specifically, the Institution alleged that \nPerson 2 had procured the advancement of a loan to Ukrderzhtsyfra, in criminal abuse \nof his power and with the intention of “ obtaining benefits from the borrower by distributing \nthe illegal profit at the expense of budget funds ” {C9.12/6/22}.  \n(3) The Supreme Court referred (it having been cited by the Institution355) to Ant Yapi as \na case involving “ similarity of legal relations ” {C9.12/6/24}, then said at {C9.12/6/25} \nthat: \n“When qualifying a transaction under Article 228 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, fault \nshould be taken into account, which is expressed in the intention to violate public policy \n(regarding the destruction, damage to property or illegal seizure of property, etc.) by \nthe parties to the transaction or one of the parties and should be established only by a court \nverdict issued in a criminal case that complies with part 1, Article 62 of the Constitution of Ukraine .  \nThe definition of a transaction as violating public policy must be preceded by a court \nverdict bringing the participant(s) to criminal liability, which would enter into force. \nA similar legal conclusion is contained, in particular, in the Resolutions of the Supreme \nCourt dated 20 December 2019 in Case No. 826/13265/13-a and dated 18 November \n2020 in Case No. 810/2287/17.” \n(4) On the facts, it found that the lower courts “ did not take into account the fact that the case \nfile did not contain a final decision (verdict) … ” {C9.12/6/25}.  \n475 Bank Concord was thus another case, like Ant Yapi, in which the claimant relied upon \nallegations of criminal conduct, by reference to the existence of a criminal investigation, in \n \n354  Beketov XX {Day27/151:24} - {Day27/152:9}; {Day28/122:22-24}. \n355  See {C9.12/6/15} (the “ the court of appeal in the contested court decision applied the legal rule, without taking into account \nthe conclusions on the application of the legal rules in similar legal relations set forth in the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated \n8 August 2019 in Case No. 2a-12868/12/2670 on the application of Article 228 of the Civil Code of Ukraine … ” and \n{C9.12/6/23}. \nAA2/15/268\n262 seeking to establish a violation of public policy. The Court did not consider whether Person \n2’s conduct might also have been civilly unlawful: the case was, it seems, put solely on the \nbasis that he was guilty of criminal abuse of authority as alleged in the criminal complaint. \nThe court, unsurprisingly, found that the mere existence of a criminal complaint and an \ninvestigation was not sufficient in circumstances where the claimant had not either alleged \nany civil unlawfulness or pointed to any other evidence of unlawfulness (which is plainly not \nthe case in the present proceedings). The two other cases to which the court referred in the \nextract quoted above (which can be found at {C9.12/16} and {C9.12/17}) were again \ncriminal tax disputes quoting Ant Yapi (and, indeed, in one of them a criminal conviction \nhad already been obtained: {C9.12/17/3}).  \n(v) The Supreme Court’s ‘latest word’356 \n476 Just last month, on 13 September 2023, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Prezenta \nPremium {C9"}

The \nSTS contended that the supply agreements were shams, that supporting \ndocumentation had been forged, and that the contracts were “ aimed at attaining personal \ngain” ([1.1] {C9.12/18/2}), on the basis that “ Kernel Trade had the intend [sic] to \nunreasonably generate a tax credit in respect of value added tax and income tax expenses by way of \ndocumenting sham purchases of grain products ” ([3.1] {C9.12/18/5}). \n(2) The lower courts had rejected the STS’ claim, inter alia  on the basis that there was no \ncriminal verdict holding the defendants of guilty of forgery (¶1.2 {C9.12/18/3}). The \nSupreme Court allowed the STS’ appeal and remitted the claim. At [4.1] \n{C9.12/18/7}, it said as follows: \n“Thus, the court of first instance, in reasoning of its decision, in particular, proceeded \nfrom the fact that when qualifying a transaction according to Article 228 of the Civil \nCode of Ukraine, one should take into account the fault expressed in the intention to \nviolate public order by the parties to the transaction or one of the parties, and such \nfault should be established only by a court verdict, issued in a criminal case, which \ncorresponds to the first part of Article 62 of the Constitution of Ukraine.  \nIn response to the above, the panel of judges notes that the absence in the actions of \nthe officials of the defendants of the elements of a crime (which would be established \nby a court verdict in a criminal case, a decision to close criminal proceedings and release \na person from criminal responsibility) cannot indicate the absence of the purpose for \n \n356  Cf.

But that argument misses the point: both Art. \n228(1) and Art. 228(3) are focused on the “ aim” of a transaction, and the issue being \nconsidered is what evidence suffices to establish that aim: there can be no sensible reason \nfor having different rules for that for the different subsections, and there is no suggestion \nof such a distinction in the case law.

Indeed, Ant Yapi, i.e. the judgment Mr Alyoshin sought \nto place so much weight on, was itself an Art. 228(3) case.358 When it was put to him that \nthe reasoning in Prezenta Premium must apply equally to all sub-sections of Art. 228, he \ndeclared himself “ not ready to answer that question ”. 359 \n(vi) Conclusions \n478 In the end, it is overwhelmingly clear from the authorities that it is Mr Beketov’s, and not \nMr Alyoshin’s, interpretation of Art. 228 that is correct:  \n(1) The Grand Chamber – which, if there is any discrepancy in the case law, should be \nfollowed over any decision of the Supreme Court – has made findings in two separate \ndecisions that contracts are void under Art. 228(1)-(2) because they were aimed at \ndepriving a third party of its property ( i.e., misappropriation) without requiring proof \nof a criminal verdict. In any event, recent Supreme Court authority (Tigerfish, June \n2023 {C9.12/3}) cites and follows the Grand Chamber’s approach.  \n \n358  See Ant Yapi at {C7/59/6} (third paragraph down) and Beketov11/¶¶25-26 {C9.2/1/9}. It is unclear form \nthe Supreme Court’s reasoning in Bank Concord whether it considered the claim to be one under Art. 228(1)-\n(2) or Art. 228(3). The references to the Court of Appeal “ mistakenly identif [ying] the concepts of ‘void’ and ‘voidable’ \ntransactions ” at {C9.12/6/25} might suggest the latter, given that the Court of Appeal had found the loan and \nguarantee to be void {C9.12/6/15}. \n359  Alysohin XX {Day31/73:22} - {Day31/74:2}. \nAA2/15/270\n264 (2) The Supreme Court has clearly articulated – both in Kahovka Prom-Agro in October \n2019 {C9.8/46.01} and in Prezenta Premium{C9.12/18} in September 2023 – that a \nfinding that a transaction is contrary to public policy or conflicts with public interests \ncan be proved not only by a criminal verdict, but also “ by other evidence available in the \ncase file in their totality ”. \n(3) That approach has the attraction of common sense: there is no logical reason why Art. \n228(1) – a provision of the Civil Code which has civil consequences – should be \nsubject to a criminal standard of proof. And, importantly, the approach also aligns \nwith the position the courts have adopted more generally to the presence or absence \nof a criminal verdict for the purposes of civil claims, which has already been discussed \nabove. As set out there, the reality is that the same factual allegations of misconduct \nagainst a defendant may give rise not only to criminal liability but also to civil law \nconsequences (be that the invalidity of a transaction or unlawful conduct for the \npurposes of a claim in tort). If (as it appears the claimants did in Ant Yapi and Bank \nConcord) a claimant relies exclusively upon allegations of criminal conduct as the basis \nfor invoking Art. 228, then the court may understandably not be prepared to make a \nfinding of criminal behaviour (or ‘aim’) without an appropriate verdict from a criminal \ncourt. But it will be prepared to consider, if the claimant invites it to, whether the facts \nof the case give rise to any (civil) unlawfulness amounting to a violation of public \npolicy; as the Supreme Court put it in Prezenta Premium, it was possible for the same \ntransaction to be characterised as having been entered into with the aim “ not only in tax \nevasion, committing a crime, but also in receiving unjustified preferences on the part of the state, in \nparticular, the formulation and reimbursement of value added tax, illegal possession of property, etc ”. \n(b) Any requ"}

English law), which imposes \nno such requirement. It is clear from the language of the cases which have necessitated a \ncriminal verdict that this requirement goes to the manner in which intention to violate public \npolicy must be proved: see e.g. Ant Yapi at {C7/59/5} (“ the fault expressed in an intent to violate \nthe public policy … which should be established only by a court judgment in a criminal case … ”) and at \n \n360  Alyoshin2/¶180 {C7/1/62}.  \nAA2/15/271\n265 {C7/59/6} (“ the Claimant has not proved that the Respondents intended to enter into the Agreement for \nthe purpose knowingly contradicting the interests of state and society … ”); as set out in Dicey at ¶34-\n046, Art. 1(3) of Rome II “ cover[s] matters, such as … the methods of proving disputed facts ” \n{M1/33.1/7}. \n480 Indeed, the correctness of this point can be illustrated by considering what the position \nwould be if there was in fact a Ukrainian criminal verdict pertaining to a transaction said to \nbe void under Art. 228(1)-(2) in proceedings before the English Court. Under English rules \nof evidence, foreign criminal convictions are subject to the rule in Hollington v Hewthorn \n[1943] 1 KB 587 (CA) {M1/3.3}, and are inadmissible as proof of guilt in subsequent civil \nproceedings: see, for recent confirmation, Benyatov v Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd \n[2022] 4 WLR 54 at [355] per Freedman J {M1/29.03/64}.361 If any Ukrainian law \nrequirement for a criminal verdict was held to be a matter for the lex causae , the claimant in \nEnglish proceedings governed by Ukrainian law would be caught in a Catch-22: as a matter \nof Ukrainian law, it would be required to adduce evidence of a criminal verdict in order to \nprove an intention to violate public policy under Art. 228(1) CC; however, as a matter of \nEnglish law, that same verdict would be inadmissible. \n(3) Article 235 CC \n481 Pursuant to Art. 235 CC (“ Legal consequences of a deceptive transaction ) {C1/6/7}:  \n“1. A transaction shall be sham [or mock362] if it has been concluded by the parties for the \npurposes of concealing another transaction, which they actually concluded.  \n2. In case it is established that the transaction has been concluded by the parties to conceal \nanother transaction, which they actually concluded, the relations between the parties shall be \ngoverned by the rules applicable to such actual transaction.” \n482 In the end, and despite protestations from Mr Alyoshin that Art. 235 had no application at \nall where the sham transaction was entered into to conceal a misappropriation,363 there ended \nup being a substantial degree of common ground as to how the provision operated in \npractice.

A summary of ( i) the categories of persons defined as being related \nto the bank; and ( ii) the types of terms considered to be preferential/non-market (both \nbefore and after 8.3.15) is set out at Beketov8/¶¶46-55 {C1/1/14}. \n485 It is common ground between Mr Beketov and Mr Alyoshin that transactions concluded in \nbreach of Art. 52 prior to 8.3.15 are voidable;367 they disagree, however, as to whether the \neffect of the amendments is to render transactions concluded after that date void or \nvoidable.368  Mr Beketov’s view, viz. that such transactions are now void, is to be preferred:  \n(1) The new version of Art. 52 states that “[ a]greements concluded by the bank with related parties \non terms that are not current market terms shall be declared invalid from the moment of their \nconclusion ” {C7/44/3}. Its predecessor stated that “[ a]greements concluded by the bank with \nrelated parties on terms more favorable than usual are declared by the court as invalid from the moment \nof their conclusion ” {C7/44/3}. The deletion of the words “ by the court ”, and the \nmandatory “ shall be declared invalid ” combine to indicate that related party transactions \nbreaching Art. 52 are void, not voidable.369  \n \n364  Resolution No. 11 of the Plenary Meeting of the Higher Commercial Court dated 29.5.13.

However, there is \nSupreme Court authority that makes clear that “[ t]he voidness of a transaction is constructed \nby means of ‘textual’ invalidity, since it exists only in the case of a direct indication by law. Such a \ndirect indication may be embodied, in particular, in terms ‘void’ and ‘invalid’ ” \n{C9.8/25.1/4}.370 \n(3) Further, the Law “ On Deposit Guarantee Fund ” expressly refers to related party \ntransactions, “ including the invalidity of which is established by Article 52(6) of the Ukrainian \nLaw ‘On Banks and Banking Activity’ ”, as being void: see Art. 38(3)(8) {C6/3/75-76}. \n(4) Mr Beketov’s view is corroborated by an article by Sayenko {C1/231/2}, which notes \nthe change in word and observes that the new version “ can be construed by the regulator as \nvoidance of such agreements as provided by the Law ”. Mr Alyoshin agreed in XX that the \narticle supported Mr Beketov’s interpretation: {Day31/90:6} - {Day31/90:12}. \n(5) Article 70 of the JSC Law \n486 Pursuant to Art. 70 of the JSC Law {C2/32/2}, and as is common ground,371 a “significant \ntransaction ” – i.e. a transaction whose value exceeds 10% or more of the value of the \ncompany’s assets according to its most recent annual financial statements – must be \napproved (depending on its precise value) by a separate resolution of the supervisory board \nor by a specified majority of shareholders at a general meeting. Art. 70(5) {C2/32/3} \ncontains an anti-circumvention provision, prohibiting the splitting of a transaction into \nseparate smaller transactions in order to avoid the effects of Art. 70; Mr Alyoshin agreed in \nXX that “ making three loans to three different nominees of the same concern ” would trigger the \nprovision.372  The task of the court is thus to ascertain the reality of the ‘transaction’ as a \nwhole.  \n487 It is common ground that, prior to 1.5.16, significant transactions concluded by a JSC in \nbreach of Art. 70 are voidable. However, there was disagreement between Mr Beketov and \nMr Alyoshin as to the effects of an amendment to the JSC Law made with effect from 1.5.16, \npursuant to which such a transaction “ creates, changes, terminates the civil rights and obligations of a \njoint-stock company only if the company further approves the transaction in the manner established for making \na decision on granting consent to its completion ” (Art. 72(1) {C2/32/5}). Mr Beketov suggested that \nthis language rendered the transaction equivalent to void; Mr Alyoshin voidable.373  The \n \n370  Alliance-IF, decision of the Supreme Court dated 11.8.21 in Case No. 344/2483/18. \n371  UkrJR/¶18 {C5/1/11}; Beketov8/¶¶58-59 {C1/1/19}; Alyoshin XX {Day31/92:15} - {Day31/93:9}. \n372  Alyoshin XX {Day31/95:13} - {Day31/96:9}. \n373  UkrJR/¶19 {C5/1/12}. \nAA2/15/274\n268 Bank contends that Mr Beketov’s interpretation is obviously the correct one: a transaction \nwhich does not create, change or terminate the rights and obligations of a company is one \nthat has no legal effect, i.e. it is void.

US$1.9bn \nfrom the Bank in the form of the Relevant Drawdowns, made under the Relevant Loans. It \nis clear on the evidence that they did so by exercising control over the Bank ( Section C , \nSection D ) and over the Borrowers ( Section G ) via their trusted associates. In particular: \n(1) The ECC members who approved the Relevant Loans were D1-2 loyalists who were \nin close communication with D1-2 in the relevant period, and have remained loyal to \nD1-2 ever since ( Sections C and D ). The Court should reject any notion that Dubilet, \nNovikov, Gurieva, Yatsenko, et al. would have approved US$2.3bn+ in loans from \nD1-2’s Bank without D1-2’s instructions to do so. \n(2) The BOK employees who arranged the Relevant Drawdowns (in conjunction with \nPBC) were also D1-2 loyalists who would simply do as they were told. Gurieva was \nand is a D1-2 loyalist; five BOK employees assisted Gurieva with her Lafferty \nSpreadsheet exercise; and Kazantsev was a D1 witness at the jurisdiction stage of these \nproceedings ( Section C2 ). The notion that the Relevant Drawdowns were made to \nthe Borrowers without D1-2’s instruction should be rejected. \n(3) The Borrowers were all owned and controlled by D1-2 via PBC. They were shell \ncompanies with no assets and no prospect of repaying the loans – on D2’s own case, \nthey were a “ flotilla of convenient vessels ” (Section G ). There is no conceivable basis on \nwhich the nominee directors and UBOs of the Borrowers would have caused the \nBorrowers to enter into the Relevant Loan Agreements or receive the Relevant \nDrawdowns without D1-2’s instructions to do so. Evading currency controls and \nrelated party lending regulations is not a leisure activity, still less when the vehicles \nused are owned by feared Ukrainian oligarchs.  \n(4) D1-2 kept their names off any incriminating documents within the Bank, and ensured \nthere was no documentary record of th"}

The fact that none of the impugned borrowing was ever put to the Supervisory \nBoard for approval, despite the Charter, Supervisory Board Regulations and Credit \nCommittee Regulations all clearly stipulating that it should be, is no coincidence. D1-\n2’s failure to preserve documents and wilful disregard of their disclosure obligations \nmore generally is a matter which justifies the Court drawing the adverse inference that, \n{AA2/15/42}\n{AA2/15/88}\n{AA2/15/178}\n{AA2/15/42}\n{AA2/15/88}\n{AA2/15/56}\n{AA2/15/178}\nAA2/15/277\n271 had documents from the period 2013-14 been available, they would have further \nconfirmed D1-2’s orchestration of the Misappropriation ( Section E ).  \n(5) Within the Bank, the Borrowers were recorded as members of ‘groups’ which reflected \nD1-2’s major industrial interests (“ ferrotraders ”, “IRMP ” etc.). The Bank’s financial \nstatements showed vast lending to the industries in which D1-2 held significant \ninterests. The Relevant Loans were then purportedly secured by D1-2’s assets (in the \nform of the Share Pledges); and when the NBU demanded that the Relevant Loans \nbe repaid, some c. US$680m of the outstanding balances were purportedly repaid using \nD1-2’s assets during the Asset Transfer. There is not a single document to suggest \nthat D1 or D2 ever complained – to their lieutenants in the Bank, to each other, or to \nanyone else – that they had nothing to do with the Borrowers or the Relevant Loans. \nThe proposition that D1-2 did not orchestrate the Relevant Loans and the Relevant \nDrawdowns is a fanciful one. \n(6) D1 is a proven micro-manager, and D2 is likewise a details man. The Court should \nreject the proposition that they did not give instructions for the Misappropriation; did \nnot even think to ask about it when it was reported by the press and investigated by \nthe NBU and GPO; and then reappointed the Management Board that ensured its \nimplementation.  \n493 The context to the above is, of course, that D1-2 could have procured any number of the \nindividuals who were involved in the fraud to come to this Court and give evidence as to \nwhat was actually going on. The inference is that none of these people, not even D1-2 \nthemselves, was willing to give evidence because if they had done so, the true position would \nhave been confirmed: the Relevant Drawdowns and associated cover up steps were \nundertaken on D1-2’s instruction and for their benefit. \n(2) The Misappropriation: laundering and concealment \n494 The Misappropriation also involved further documentation and transactions, the purpose of \nwhich was to conceal the theft and launder the proceeds. D1-2 used their control of the \nBank, the Borrowers and D3-8 ( Section G ) to procure ( i) the RSAs and Unreturned \nPrepayments by which drawdowns to Ukrainian borrowers were transferred in US dollars \nto D3-8; and ( ii) the RSA Pledges and LFSA Pledges as sham security for the Relevant Loans. \nThe Relevant Supply Agreements (and associated documents) were nothing more than a \nfurther papering exercise, drawn up ostensibly to satisfy Ukrainian currency regulations and \nprovide a superficial justification to get US dollars out of Ukraine.

Like the Relevant Loans, the Intermediary Loans were \napproved by D1-2’s lieutenants on the ECC and arranged by D1-2’s minions at BOK \nand PBC ( Section F ); the Intermediary Borrowers were worthless shell companies \ncontrolled by D1-2 via  PBC ( Section G ); and the Court should reject any notion that \nthese loans were granted without D1-2’s instructions.  \n(2) They used their ownership and control of the Bank, the Asset Transferors and the \nBorrowers to procure the transfer to the Bank of the Transferred Assets at \nfraudulently inflated values ( Section H ). D1-2 knew perfectly well that the value of \nthe Assets had been vastly inflated; and the true purpose of the Asset Transfer was to \nseek to conceal the loss caused by the Misappropriation by making it appear (in the \nBank’s records, and to the NBU) as if Relevant Loans had been repaid.384  The \nMortgages were also void (because the Relevant Loans which secured them were \nvoid), although the Bank is plainly not bound by the inflated values even if they were \nvalid.  \n(3) They used their ownership and control of the Bank, the Borrowers and the New \nBorrowers to procure the New Loans ( Section H ). D1-2 have all but abandoned the \ncase that they were not responsible for the Transformation, and the Court should \nreject any suggestion that they did not give the detailed instructions to their lieutenants \nin the Bank to implement it.  \n(3) The loans are all void \n496 Applying the principles of Ukrainian law set out in Section I  above, the loan agreements \nentered into by the Bank with the Borrowers, Intermediary Borrowers and New Borrowers \nare void for one or more of the following reasons:  \n \n384  Reply/¶28A {A1/25/48}. \n{AA2/15/88}\n{AA2/15/178}\n{AA2/15/149}\n{AA2/15/178}\n{AA2/15/206}\n{AA2/15/206}\n{AA2/15/222}\nAA2/15/279\n273 497 Art. 228(1)-(2) and Art. 235 CC: all loans.

The Intermediary Borrowers and New \nBorrowers were shell entities with no assets and no incomes; yet the Bank granted them \nbillions of dollars in loans without any valid security on interest rates which were \nsubstantially below those prevailing in Ukraine in 2015-16 (see RRFI/¶4 {A2/16/5}). The \nIntermediary and New Borrowers were all related parties to the Bank, within the definition \nset out at Beketov8/¶52 {C1/1/17}.386   \n499 Art. 70 JSC Law: New Loans. The New Loans were granted as part of the Transformation \n– a coordinated scheme for replacing ‘old’ loans to D1-2 companies with new loans to the \nNew Borrowers, which were also D1-2 companies: see Section H3  above. In October and \nNovember 2016, the Bank issued New Loans with a total face value of c. UAH 137bn, at a \ntime when its latest financial statements (as of 31.12.15) showed total assets of UAH 274bn \n{K1/5/5}. The New Loans, assessed in aggregate (as the anti-circumvention provision in \nArt. 70(5) of the JSC Law requires, because they were in, in reality, part of a single scheme), \ntherefore exceeded 10% of the value of the Bank’s assets, and were therefore “ significant \ntransactions ” subject to the authorisation regime set out in Art. 70. However, the New Loans \nwere not the subject of formal approval by the shareholders or the Supervisory Board, as \nArticle 70 requires, a fact which the New Borrowers (as entitles owned and controlled by \n \n385  See also Bank Opening/¶192 ff {AA2/1/85}, ¶368 {AA2/1/154} and ¶404 ff {AA2/1/167}. \n386  The Relevant Loans, and the Intermediary Loans granted before 8.3.15, also breached Art. 52; however, the \nconsequence was to render them voidable, rather than void: see Section I2 (&&) above. \n{AA2/15/149}\n{AA2/15/206}\n{AA2/15/222}\n{AA2/15/217}\n{AA2/15/223}\nAA2/15/280\n274 D1-2) had knowledge. The New are therefore void pursuant to Article 72(1): see Section I  \nabove).  \n(4) D1-2’s unlawful conduct \n500 The Bank contends that D1-2’s conduct, as summarised above, leads to the conclusion that:   \n(1) D1-2 committed gross breaches of so-called fiduciary duties they owed to the Bank \nunder Art. 63 of the JSC Law, Arts. 42 (in relation to conduct after 10.1.15) and 43 of \nthe Law on Banks, and Art. 92(3) CC.  \n(2) D1-2 breached the prohibitions against ( i) deprivation of ownership, as set out in Art. \n3(1)(2) CC; and ( ii) abuse of rights, as set out in Art. 13(2)-(3) CC.  \n(a) Breach of fiduciary duty \n501 The scope and content of the fiduciary duties has been addressed in Section I2  above. \nThere does not appear to be any serious dispute that D1-2, as members of the Supervisory \nBoard of the Bank from the early 2000s until its nationalisation (and, in D2’s case, as Chair \nof the Board until c. May 2015) owed fiduciary duties to the Bank at all relevant times: see \nSection I2  above. D1-2’s breaches of those duties is clear and obvious:  \n(1) It was not in the Bank’s interests, reasonable, in good faith, or in furtherance of the \neconomic development of the Bank for D1-2 to procure the grant of US$2.3bn+ in \nvoid loans to their own companies so as to misappropriate those funds, and for D1-2 \nthen to take steps to conceal the loss to the Bank resulting from their fraud by \nprocuring further fraudulent loans. \n(2) D1-2’s procurement of the Bank to grant the void Relevant Loans and advance the \nRelevant Drawdowns constituted a breach of their fiduciary duties: procuring another \nto do an unlawful act constitutes a breach of duty: Section I .

The fact that D1-2 did \nnot themselves sign loan agreements or press ‘enter’ on the Bank’s system to generate \na Relevant Drawdown is nothing to the point; nor is their deliberate decision to ensure \nthat their names did not appear on any of the paperwork associated with the \nMisappropriation. The generals are not innocent of the wrongs committed by their \nsoldiers acting on their orders. \n(3) Equally irrelevant is the fact that D1-2 did not give any formal instructions in relation \nto the Misappropriation in their capacity qua Supervisory Board members. Ukrainian \nlaw is not as obtuse as Mr Alyoshin would have it:: see Section I2  above. \n{AA2/15/222}\n{AA2/15/223}\n{AA2/15/223}\n{AA2/15/222}\n{AA2/15/223}\nAA2/15/281\n275 (4) Indeed, D1-2 would have breached their fiduciary duties even if the only allegations \nthat could be levelled against them was that they had failed to ensure that related and \nhigh-value lending was submitted to the Supervisory Board for approval (as the Bank’s \ninternal documents required it to be – see above) and had failed to identify and take \nsteps to prevent fraudulent lending. They could not have been discharging their duties \nto the Bank by allowing such a widescale fraud to take place, over a course of years, \nright under their noses; a fortiori , they breached their duties by orchestrating said fraud, \nwhether they did so whilst formally sitting at a Supervisory Board meeting or not. \n(b) Breach of Articles 3(1)(2) and 13(2)-(3) CC \n502 Further or alternatively, D1-2’s conduct breached the prohibitions against ( i) deprivation of \nownership, as set out in Art. 3(1)(2) CC; and ( ii) abuse of rights, as set out in Arts. 13(2)-(3) \nCC.  \n(1) The very purpose of the Misappropriation was to deprive the Bank of its funds. There \nwas no justification, either in the Constitution or in any other provision of Ukrainian \nlaw, for such conduct. D1-2’s conduct was accordingly a breach of the prohibition on \nownership deprivation contained in Art. 3(1)(2) CC. \n(2) D1-2 exercised their rights of ownership and control over the Borrowers, \nIntermediary Borrowers, D3-8 and New Borrowers, and their rights as 90% \nshareholders and Supervisory Board members within the Bank in bad faith, for the \nillegitimate purpose of misappropriating the Bank’s funds, and in violation of the \nBank’s own right to inviolability of ownership of its own funds. Their conduct \nconstituted an abuse of rights contrary to Art. 13(2)-(3) CC.  \n(c) Unlawful conduct of both  D1 and D2 \n503 For the avoidance of any doubt, all of the above points apply equally to both D1 and D2. \nThe Bank refers to the two men together in this section because the evidence demonstrates \nthat the fraud on the Bank was undertaken at their direction and with the approval of both \nD1 and D2. The Bank’s case against D2 is not simply that he gave ‘standing approval’ to D1 \nto exercise control over all or any part of the Bank or Relevant Entities’ actions. D2’s \nfrequent complaints that he has been unjustifiably lumped together with D1387 fall flat.  \n504 Finally, the absence of any criminal conviction against D1-2 is irrelevant to the question of \nwhether D1-2 acted unlawfully for the purposes of Art. 1166: see above. So too is the \n \n387  See e.g. D2’s oral opening {Day7/1:7}.  \nAA2/15/282\n276 absence of any prior finding of invalidity in relation to the Relevant Loans, RSAs etc.; in \nUkoopspilka the Grand Chamber expressly found that such circumstances “ cannot indicate the \nlegality of the defendants’ actions ”: see above.  \nJ2 THE SECOND AND THIRD ELEMENTS : HARM AND CAUS"}

D1-2 became liable in tort upon the \noccurrence of the Relevant Drawdowns, and accordingly they are required to provide full \ncompensation for the loss that is referable to the harm caused.  \n506 Details of the loss suffered by the Bank as a result of the Misappropriation – which may be \nsummarised as the total of the Relevant Drawdowns extracted from the Bank, minus any \ngenuine recoveries – are considered in Section M  below. The quantification of that loss is \na question of fact for the court to decide.  \n507 Returning to tortious liability, the harm was caused as a matter of fact – irrespective of \nwhether the appropriate yardstick is ‘but for’, ‘directness’, ‘objective consequence’, ‘main \nreason’ or otherwise – by the unlawful conduct of D1-2. That is because:   \n(1) As set out at Section I above, it is quite clear from the authorities that ‘direct’ \ncausation does not mean ‘last in time’, or that the defendant is the ‘only’ cause of a \nloss, or that no other party also acted unlawfully. The fact that the likes of Novikov, \nDubilet and Gurieva may also have committed unlawful acts does not (despite the \nefforts of D1-2 to suggest to the contrary388) break the chain of causation between \nD1-2’s acts of procurement and the loss suffered by the Bank. \n(2) Quite simply, but for D1-2’s instigation and sanction, none of the participants in the \nMisappropriation (natural or legal persons) would have acted in the way they did. As \nthe evidence summarised in Sections C-G  demonstrates, individual actors like \nNovikov, Dubilet and Gurieva were subordinates of D1-2 who complied with their \ninstructions; the Borrowers, Intermediary Borrowers, D3-8 and the New Borrowers \nhad no independent existence; they were simply vehicles controlled by D1-2 via PBC \nand Primecap which existed to fulfil D1-2’s purposes. \n(3) The position is a fortiori given that (as described above), in order to comply with the \nfiduciary duties they owed to the Bank, D1-2 were obliged (and failed) to take steps \nto identify and protect the Bank against fraudulent activity. The case is therefore one \n \n388  See e.g. D1 Opening/¶40 {AA3/1/17}; Alyoshin XX {Day29/118:21} - {Day29/120:9}. \n{AA2/15/358}\n{AA2/15/358}\n{AA2/15/222}\n{AA2/15/42}-\n{AA2/15/178}\nAA2/15/283\n277 in which, in Mr Alyoshin’s words, “ the scope of the duty assumes the possibility of the damages \nclaimed ”: see above. Given that precisely this eventuality has materialised, “ a legally \nsignificant causal link ” exists as between D1-2’s omissions and the harm which ensued. \n508 The Bank further contends that D1-2 are jointly and severally liable for the entirety of the \nharm suffered by the Bank: \n(1) Insofar as it is necessary to do so (see above), the Bank contends that all four elements \nof an Art. 1166 CC claim – and, specifically, causation – can be established as against \neach of D1 and D2 independently, such that each is severally liable to the Bank for \nthe entirety of the loss.  \n(2) But in any event, the elements of Art. 1190 CC are also satisfied, such that they are \njointly and severally liable, because D1-2 caused “ indivisible harm by interrelated, \n[cumulative/collective ] actions or actions with unity of intent ”: if (as the Bank contends) D1-2 \nwere both behind the Misappropriation, as an overarching scheme to defraud the \nBank, the enti"}

D1 abandoned the ‘politically motivated \ncampaign’ allegations in his opening;390 D1-2 chose not to cross-examine Ms Domashenko \nor Mr Shekmar; and the Grand Chamber in Ukoopspilka considered that similar allegations \nagainst a curator “ cannot serve as a basis for exempting the bank’s officials from liability ” (¶7.67 at \n{C9.8/1/36}. \nJ3 THE FOURTH ELEMENT : FAULT  \n510 The burden of proof is upon D1-2 to establish that they were not at fault ( i.e. did not, by \ntheir unlawful conduct, cause the Bank loss negligently or with intent). D1’s attempt to do \nso has been confined to an assertion that “ there is no reason to suppose that D1 did not intend the \nRelevant Loans to be repaid (as they were) ”,391 a statement that is primarily revealing in its apparent \nacknowledgment that D1 was fully aware of the Relevant Loans. D2 has suggested that “ there \nis no evidence that [D2] was involved in or knew of the alleged ‘Scheme’ … He cannot be liable for failing \n \n389  D1Def/¶34 {A1/8/21}, ¶48 {A1/8/26}, ¶¶53-55 {A1/8/27-29}.

Nor has the Bank articulated or evidenced any case \nas to how [D2] could reasonably have discovered and prevented such lending ”.392  For the reasons set out \nin the preceding paragraphs, all of those propositions must be dismissed. \nJ4 COMPETITION OF CLAIMS  \n511 D1-2 have no viable competition of claims defence because:  \n(1) They have not proved the existence of any employment or service contract between \nthemselves and the Bank, let alone any terms in such a putative contract that might \nprohibit the Bank’s claim. In any event, the claims fall outside the scope of any \nemployment/service contract because they relate to D1-2’s status as officers of the \nBank: see above. \n(2) The Relevant Loans (whether valid or invalid) do not preclude the Bank’s Art. 1166 \nCC claim for the reasons set out at above.  \n• • • \nK LIABILITY OF D3-8 \n512 The Bank pursues two causes of action against D3-8: ( i) a claim in tort under Art. 1166 \nCC,393 which it is common ground is governed by Ukrainian law; and ( ii) a claim in unjust \nenrichment, either under Arts. 1212 to 1214 CC or as a matter of Cypriot law.394  \nK1 CLAIM IN TORT \n(1) The first element: unlawful conduct \n513 The Bank contends that each of D3-8 breached the prohibitions against deprivation of \nownership as set out in Art. 3(1)(2) CC {C1/6/1}, and abuse of rights as set out in Art. 13 \nCC {C9.9/14/1}.  \n514 The conduct of D3-8 which gives rise to breaches of these duties comprises their \nparticipation in the Misappropriation and subsequent attempts to conceal it. In particular: \n(1) The Misappropriation entailed the extraction of monies from the Bank via the \nRelevant Loans and the subsequent transfer of the proceeds to, eventually, D3-8.

D3-8 facilitated the onward transmission of the funds \nmisappropriated from the Bank, and assisted in the concealment of the misappropriation. \nThat conduct is sufficient to constitute a breach of Art. 3(1)(2).  \n516 D3-8’s conduct also breached Art. 13 CC: D3-8 exercised their rights to enter into \n(purported) transactions, and to receive funds thereunder, for an illegitimate purpose ( viz. in \nfurtherance of fraud) and with the intention of harming the Bank.  \n517 D3-5’s principal defence to the claims against them is to suggest that they entered into the \nRSAs as agents for undisclosed principals, pursuant to the (English-law governed) Alleged \nAgency Agreements.396 But that argument is of limited relevance, let alone merit: \n(1) D3-5’s acts of participation in the fraud are the same whether they were undertaken \non their own behalf or pursuant to the Alleged Agency Agreements.  \n(2) The argument appears to have been advanced principally to allow D3-5 to suggest that \nthey entered into the RSAs “ in the good faith belief that they were genuine transactions ” and \n“without seeking to verify the substance of the arrangements for which they were provided ”.397  But \nthat suggestion becomes a mockery in the face of the patently uncommercial terms of \nthe RSAs, of D3-8’s own submission at trial that the RSAs were just part of a “ game of \n \n395  D3-8Def/¶42 {A1/20/23}, ¶66(1) {A1/20/33}.  \n396  D3-8Def/¶11 {A1/20/3}, ¶¶16-18 {A1/20/5}.  \n397  D3-8Def/¶17(1) {A1/20/7}; D3-8 Opening/¶9(a) {AA5/1/8}, ¶20 {AA5/1/14}, ¶32 {AA5/1/19}. \nAA2/15/286\n280 hot potato ” (as to which see above), and of the overwhelming evidence that D3-8 and \nthe Alleged Principals were under the common ownership and control of D1-2: see \nSection G above.398 \n(3) In these circumstances, the knowledge and intentions of D1-2 are to be attributed to \nD3-8 for the purposes of determining whether or not the latter has breached Art. 13 \nCC.

But D3-8 could equally have had their accounts with the Bank’s \nLatvian subsidiary, as long as they provided a route by which funds could be extracted from \nUkraine. By contrast, D3-8’s obligation to give restitution to the Bank is manifestly more \nclosely connected with Ukraine, given that: ( i) they received the Unreturned Prepayments as \npart of a fraudulent scheme controlled by two Ukrainian oligarchs with the purpose and \neffect of misappropriating funds from a Ukrainian bank; ( ii) the scheme was implemented \nby Ukrainian individuals at BOK, PBC and Primecap (including D3-8’s Ukrainian nominee \nUBOs403); (iii) D3-8 knew that the Unreturned Prepayments were funded by fraudulent loans \nfrom the Bank in Ukraine; and ( iv) the choreography of the fraud (including the sham RSAs \nexecuted by D3-8) was designed to conceal breaches of Ukrainian currency control \nregulations. \nK3 CLAIM IN UNJUST ENRICHMENT – UKRAINIAN LAW  \n524 The elements of an unjust enrichment claim under Art. 1212 {C1/6/13} are ( i) acquisition \nor preservation of property; ( ii) at the expense of the claimant; with ( iii) an absence of \nsufficient legal grounds for the acquisition (or such grounds having fallen away).404   \n(1) Acquisition or preservation of property  \n525 D3-8 received property in the form of the Unreturned Prepayments. It is common ground \nbetween Mr Beketov and Mr Nahnybida that property includes money, and in particular \nfunds in a bank account: UkrJR/¶77.1 {C5/1/31}. \n526 D3-5 contend that they received Unreturned Prepayments as trustees for the Alleged \nPrincipals under the (English-law governed) Alleged Agency Agreements, such that they did \nnot themselves acquire property for the purposes of Article 1212 CC.405  That argument fails: \n(1) The Alleged Agency Agreements are shams, and accordingly of no effect, such that \nno trust obligations arise. \n \n403  Namely.

However, the Court of Appeal allowed the STS’ appeal, observing that \n“PF ‘Ukraine’ is not a payer of paid amounts of military levy, personal income tax and social security \ntax payments, and therefore, has no right to return erroneously or excessively included in the budget \ntaxes, fees and social security tax paid by third parties ” (at [28] {C9.6/4/23}).  \n(4) The Peasant Farm appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing inter alia  that “ the court of \nappeal did not take into account that all taxes were paid by the funds of PF ‘Ukraine’ … ” (at [39] \n{C9.6/4/25}).  \n(5) The Supreme Court allowed the Peasant Farm’s appeal and upheld its claim against \nthe STS, stating (at ¶72-74 {C9.6/4/29}) that: \n“72. As established by the court of first instance, the explanations of the claimant and \nthird parties confirm that they did not accrue and pay their employees’ wages at the \nexpense of and in the amount of funds received from the claimant on the accounts \nopened by them in banking institutions in Zaporizhzhia, and the specified cash the \nfunds were not included in the wage fund of their enterprises and did not become part \nof the income of their employees.  \n73. Therefore, as evidenced by the circumstances of the case established by the local \ncommercial court, third parties as tax agents have no obligations to pay due to the \nprovisions of the Tax Code of Ukraine, the Law of Ukraine ‘On Collection and \nAccounting of Social Security Tax’ from these funds, the sums of personal income tax, \nmilitary levy, and a single contribution to mandatory state social insurance, and the \nAA2/15/291\n285 opening of accounts in their name in banking institutions in Zaporizhzhia city, crediting \nthem without the claimant’s knowledge of funds belonging to him, withdrawing cash \nfunds with advance payment of personal income tax, military levy and social security \ntax, committed for the illegal (in the absence of a legal basis) seizure of the claimant’s \nfunds.  \n74. Therefore, under the established circumstances of the case, the disputed amounts \nof taxes and other mandatory payments were unjustifiably paid at the expense of the \nclaimant.” \n530 The Supreme Court’s decision is thus a very clear example of indirect enrichment: the STS \ndid not receive funds directly from the Peasant Farm, but rather from accounts (operated \nby fraudsters) in the names of third-party companies. Nor were the STS’s enrichment and \nthe Peasant Farm’s loss “ simultaneous ” (as Mr Nahnybida previously insisted they needed to \nbe414) – rather, they were separated in time by at least a day.415 Indeed, Mr Nahnybida \nacknowledged that “ there were several transfers of the Farm "}

D3-8 have belatedly \nsuggested that the maximum the Bank can recover is the value of its loss, and not the value \nof D3-8’s gain (such that recoveries should be reduced by reference to currency fluctuations \nor, assuming their success, D1’s loss defences).428 That argument should be rejected: \n(1) It is common ground that there is no Ukrainian case expressly addressing this issue. \nHowever, what is clear from the language of Arts. 1212 and 1213 themselves is that \nthey are focused upon the acquisition and return of property (see e.g. the references to \n“return … in kind ” and the determination of the “ value” of the “ unjustly acquired property ” \n{C1/6/12-13}). \n(2) As Mr Nahnybida himself pointed out (and as he reiterated in XX429), “the law of \nUkraine consistently distinguishes unjust enrichment claims from tortious liability ”.430 Thus in the \nKremenchug City Council case at [66] {C4/4/613}, the Grand Chamber of the \nSupreme Court observed that “ tort obligations arising from infliction of harm to property are \ncharacterized, in particular, by a reduction in the property of the victim, whereas unjust enrichment \nobligations – by an increase of property of the acquirer without sufficient legal grounds ”.

Mr Nathanael was instructed part-way through these \nproceedings after the Bank’s original expert, Petros Artemis, unfortunately passed away. Mr \nArtemis, like Mr Nathanael, sat on the Cyprus Supreme Court (for 12 years), including \nlatterly as President. In contrast, D3-8’s expert is Andreas Erotocritou, who qualified as a \nCypriot lawyer in 2007. Whilst the Court will of course be guided primarily by the substance \nof the respective experts’ evidence, the Bank submits that, in circumstances where a large \npart of the dispute between them is how the Cyprus Supreme Court would be likely to \ninterpret various issues if a case such as the extant one were to come before it, the views of \nMessrs Artemis and Nathanael carry significantly more weight. That is particularly so given \nthat it was revealed in XX that Mr Erotocritou had breached his duty to the Court as an \nexpert by citing a passage from the Indian textbook, Pollock and Mulla, in support of his \nthesis that s.65 did not provide for a claim for indirect enrichment, when another passage \nfrom that textbook reached the opposite conclusion {Day34/60:16} - {Day34/67:10}. \n(1) The Contract Law, Cap. 149 and weight attached to English authority  \n539 It is common ground that: ( i) the starting point for interpreting the Contract Law is the \nwording of the relevant provision;433 (ii) the Contract Law should be interpreted in \naccordance with English law provided that the latter is not inconsistent with the Contract \nLaw itself or a decision of the Cypriot Supreme Court;434 and ( iii) the Contract Law is not \nexhaustive – developments in the law can be recognised provided that they do not contradict \nthe meaning or text of the statute itself or a decision of the Supreme Court.435 \n540 As regards the extent to which guidance can be drawn from English case law, and the extent \nof any contradiction required between English law and Cypriot law before the Cypriot courts \nwill ignore English law, Mr Erotocritou accepts in his reports that: ( i) common law, in \nparticular English law, can be relied upon to interpret the Contract Law to the extent it is \n \n433  CypJR/¶2(a)(1)(i) {C12/1/4}. \n434  CypJR/¶2(a)(1)(ii) {C12/1/4}. \n435  CypJR/¶2(a)(1)(iii) {C12/1/4-5}. \nAA2/15/295\n289 not inconsistent with the same;436 and ( ii) referring to English law in support of reasoning \non specific points of unjust enrichment is an orthodox approach.437 \n541 In XX, Mr Erotocritou further accepted that: ( i) as the principles of English legal \ninterpretation develop and evolve, so Cypriot law applying such principles will also develop \nand evolve {Day34/6:12-17}; ( ii) in the absence of Cypriot law on a particular point, the \nCypriot courts can and will look to English law principles "}

It is therefore (or ought to be) common ground \nthat if a claimant is party to an agreement or transaction which is prima facie  legal, but which \nis in fact tainted by illegality, provided the claimant is unaware of, and not party to, the \nillegality they will not be barred from bringing a claim under s.70.  \n549 The Bank has established liability under s.70. Through the Relevant Loans and RSAs, the \nBank indirectly conferred a benefit (the Unreturned Prepayments) upon D3-8. The Bank’s \nconduct constituted a “ lawful act ” (for these purposes, the Bank being unaware of the illegality \ntainting the transactions, acting bona fide  and as the victim of the Misappropriation), “ for \nanother person ” (D3-8), by which the Bank did not intend to act “ gratuitously ”. D3-8 are \ntherefore “ bound to make compensation to [the Bank ] in respect of, or to restore ” the Unreturned \nPrepayments. Whether the Bank intended to enrich D3-8 is irrelevant. Similarly, for the same \nreasons as set out below in respect of s.65, it is irrelevant that the Bank conferred the benefit \nupon D3-8 indirectly via the Borrowers; an indirect benefit falls within the scope of s.70 as \ninterpreted in accordance with English law principles.446 \n(3) Section 65 \n550 The Bank’s claim against D3-D8 is also made under s.65 of the Contract Law,447 the text of \nwhich is set out at {C10/3/2}.

That proposition should be rejected. \n555 Mr Nathanael’s view, which is in accordance with the English law principles that Mr \nErotocritou accepts the Cypriot courts would apply, is that: ( i) there is nothing in s.65 which \nprovides that the defendant must have received the benefit (or “ advantage ”) directly from the \nclaimant; and ( ii) s.65 can apply to indirect benefits given the right circumstances; for \nexample, conferral of a benefit indirectly through a series of sham transactions or \ntransactions forming part of a single composite scheme.453 \n556 As regards ( iii), Mr Erotocritou’s overly broad view (that s.65 does not permit a claim in \nrespect of what he terms “ illegal agreements or contracts ”,454 no matter the circumstances) must \nbe rejected: ( a) for the same reasons as those in respect of s.70; and ( b) because it is \nunsupported by the Cypriot authority upon which he relies in relation to s.65.455 Mr \nNathanael’s view (which was not challenged during XX – {Day33/147:9} - \n \n449  Nathanael2/¶¶77-79 {C10/37/24-25}. \n450  Which provides that “ any person ”, not “ any party ”, must restore a benefit received under a void contract, the use \nof “person ” standing in contrast to other provisions of the Contract Law which specifically refer to a “ party” \n(e.g. ss. 62 and 64 - {C10/3/2}). \n451  Nathanael2/¶79 {C10/37/25}.

In Cyprus Popular Bank (Finance) Ltd ν Hinni \n(2008) 1Β AAD 818 (cited Erotocritou2/¶5.32 {C11/69/18}), again, there was no contract at all (so there was \nno agreement which was void ab initio  or which became void due to some event).  \nAA2/15/299\n293 {Day33/148:13}), that a party who has acted in good faith, irrespective of whether a contract \nis tainted by illegality,456 must prevail. \n557 The Bank has also established liability under s.65. Through two sets of contracts (the \nRelevant Loans and RSAs), D3-8 received a benefit (the Unreturned Prepayments) from the \nBank (via the Borrowers). Those contracts are void (see Section J1 above). D3-8 are \ntherefore bound to restore the benefit (the Unreturned Prepayments) to the “ person from whom \n[they] received [them]”, i.e. the Bank. It matters not that D3-8 were not party to a contract with \nthe Bank directly: ( i) the intervening contracts are shams and are void; and/or ( ii) the \ncontracts were co-ordinated transactions which formed a single composite scheme. \nApplying English law principles, the indirect conferral of the benefit by the Bank upon D3-\n8 is sufficient.457 \n(4) Freestanding claim in unjust enrichment \n558 Mr Nathanael’s view is that not only does s.70 provide a basis for an autonomous cause of \naction in unjust enrichment, but there is room for such cause of action outside the scope of \nthe Contract Law, and that, upon being presented with an opportunity to do so, the Cypriot \nCourts will explicitly recognise that an independent cause of action in unjust enrichment can \nexists as a matter of Cypriot law.458 Mr Nathanael’s view is correct: \n(1) It is consistent with Cypriot Supreme Court authority459 in which claims in unjust \nenrichment were considered without any reference whatsoever to the Contract Law, \nbut instead to the general principals of unjust enrichment as articulated in English case \nlaw.460 In XX, Mr Erotocritou further accepted that the claims in the relevant Supreme \nCourt authorities would not in any event have fallen within the scope of ss.65 or 70 \n{Day34/78:25} –{Day34/79:9}. Mr Erotocritou refused to accept the proposition \nthat the claims in unjust enrichment in the relevant cases did not fail because they did \nnot satisfy ss.65 or 70, but rather because they failed to satisfy the requirements set \nout in the English case law.

The defence of \nchange of position would not be available to a defendant who (all other things being equal) had, for example, \nbeen unjustly enriched by the receipt of money, which money the defendant had used to discharge a pre-\nexisting debt which the defendant would otherwise have had to discharge in any event (Scottish Equitable plc \nv Derby [2001] 3 All ER 818 CA {M1/8.4}). But, in such circumstances, it would of course be right to say \nthat that defendant had “ enjoyed the benefit ” of their enrichment. In other words, a change of position (for the \npurposes of a change of position defence) does not simply involve a defendant divesting themselves of the \nenrichment. Put another way, all other things being equal, where a defendant who has been enriched by \nmistaken overpayments over time has increased their expenditure in a way which they would not otherwise \nhave done, and has ‘enjoyed the benefit’ of that increased expenditure, they are nonetheless entitled to rely on \nthe change of position defence (Philip Collins Ltd v Davis [2000] 3 All ER 808 {M1/8.1}). \n465  Nathanael2/¶47 {C10/37/15}. \n466  The receipt of money is an incontrovertible benefit to D3-8: Burrows, The Law of Restitution (3rd ed., 2011), \np. 48 {M1/30.1/3}, the concept of an incontrovertible benefit having met with judicial approval in, e.g. BP \nExploration Co (Libya) Ltd v Hunt (No 2) [1970] 1 WLR 783 (per Robert Goff J) {M1/3.5}; Chief Constable \nof the Greater Manchester Police v Wigan Athletic AFC Ltd [2008] EWCA Civ 1449 {M1/13.2}. \n467  Burrows, The Law of Restitution, p. 561 {M1/30.1/4}; Portman Building Society v Hamlyn Taylor Neck \n[1998] 4 All ER 202 at 207 {M1/6.4/6}; High Commissioner for Pakistan in the United Kingdom v Prince \nMuffakham Jah [2020] Ch 421 {C10/29/1}. \n468  Dargamo Holdings Ltd v Avonwick Holdings Ltd [2022] "}

Indeed, in XX, Mr Erotocritou appeared \nto row-back from that assertion, accepting that if the issue came before the Cypriot courts \n“they would say ‘well, the right analysis is you look at the restoration of the gain made by the defendant \nrather than what the claimant has lost ’…” {Day34/90:2-8}. Mr Erotocritou further accepted that \nthe Cypriot courts would seek guidance from and follow common law {Day34/87:2-10}, \nand, to the extent that English law was settled on the issue, the Cypriot courts would follow \nEnglish law {Day34/87:11-24}. He also failed to offer any positive view as to what the \nCypriot courts would in fact do if and when faced with a claim where the defendant’s gain \nexceeds the claimant’s loss {Day34/88:1-4}. \n562 The position as a matter of English law is clear: the restitution required of a defendant who \nhas been unjustly enriched is measured by reference to the defendant’s gain, not by the \nclaimant’s loss.470 As Mr Erotocritou accepts, the Cypriot courts would look to, and apply, \nthe English law position. \n(6) Defences \n563 D3-8 have no defence to the Bank’s claims.

In \nthis section, we address ( i) the Ukrainian law of limitation; ( ii) the Bank’s Charter; ( iii) \nknowledge of employees at the Bank; ( iv) the exercise of the discretion to disapply the \nlimitation period; ( v) English public policy; and ( vi) the September 2020 amendments to the \nPOC. \n(2) Ukrainian Law of Limitation  \n(a) The general limitation period \n565 Pursuant to Art. 257 (“ General limitation period ”), “[ t]he general limitation period shall be three years ” \n{C1/6/8}. Art. 261(1) (“ Commencement of the limitation period ”) {C1/6/8} states that “[ t]he \nlimitation period shall begin to run from the date on which a person became or could have become aware of a \nviolation of his right or of the person who violated such right ”. Art. 261(1) thus distinguishes between \n‘actual’ (“ became … aware ”) and ‘constructive’ (“ could have become aware ”) knowledge. It should \nbe noted at the outset that D1 and D3-8 plead a limitation defence based only on actual \nknowledge; D2 also pleads a case based on constructive knowledge.473 \n566 These articles (and Art. 267(5) CC {C1/6/9}, on disapplication, discussed below) fall to be \ninterpreted in line with the other articles in the CC (including the general principles set out \nin Art. 3 and Arts. 13 and 16(3) on abuse of rights {C1/6/1-2}, {C9.9/14/1}474) and with \nArt. 6(1) of the ECHR  {C1/5/1}, which has direct effect under Ukrainian law .475 Indeed, \nas Mr Alyoshin agreed,476 Ukrainian courts consistently refer to Art. 6(1) ECHR when \n \n471  CypJR, p. 11 {C12/1/11} and pp. 14-15 {C12/1/14-15}. \n472  CypJR, p. 11 {C12/1/11} and pp. 14-15 {C12/1/14-15}. \n473  D1Def/¶86 {A1/8/49}; D2Def/¶54(1) {A1/18/27}; D3-8Def/¶63 {A1/20/32}. \n474  See also Sirius-Bud at [94.5]-[94.6] {C7/78/40}; Alyoshin XX {Day30/51:16-20}.  \n475  UkrJR/¶1.3 {C5/1/3}; Alyoshin XX {Day30/51:21} - {Day30/52:2}.  \n476  Alyoshin XX {Day30/52:12-16}, {Day30/54:17} - {Day30/55:5}. \n{AA2/15/8}\nAA2/15/303\n297 considering the construction and application of the CC limitation provisions.477  \nAccordingly, the key point (as Mr Alyoshin also agreed478) is that those provisions should \nnot be construed in such a way as to impose an unnecessary, disproportionate or arbitrary \nfetter on the ability to bring a claim; as the Supreme Court put it in SFG Hermes at [5.85] \n{C9.7/11/19} (quoting ECtHR case law), “[ t]here should not be a too formal attitude to the \nrequirements stipulated by law, since access to justice should be not only actual, but also real ”. \n(b) What a claimant must (actually or constructively) know \n567 There was a debate between the experts as to whether a claimant must have “ actual or \nconstructive knowledge of facts or matters sufficient to allow them to allege the existence of each of the elements \nin the cause of action to which the violation in question gives rise ” (Mr Beketov479) or whether only \nknowledge of “ violation of its right or identity of violator ” is sufficient for time to start runn"}

Mr Beketov has pointed to cases \nwhich have analysed the need, consistently with Ukraine’s ECHR obligations, to apply the \n \n477  See, for example, SFG Hermes at [5.82]-[5.85] {C9.7/11/19}; Person 7 v Person 5, decision of the Horodok \nDistrict Court dated 23.3.18 in Case No. 441/755/15-ts/441/2/2018 at {C9.8/17/6}.   \n478  Alyoshin XX {Day30/55:12-21}. \n479  Beketov8/¶¶293-294 {C1/1/94}; UkrJR/¶102.1 {C5/1/40}; Beketov9/¶¶373-378 {C6/1/144-145}.  \n480  UkrJR/¶102.2 {C5/1/40}; Alyoshin2/¶279 ff {C7/1/92-94}.  \n481  D1Def/¶85 {A1/8/49}; Reply/¶22.2 {A1/25/27}.

As Mr Alyoshin \nagreed in XX, whether or not the facts are that obvious is ultimately a question of fact; he \nfurther agreed that it “ could be relevant ” if “ the wrongdoers had compromised a company’s systems and \ncontrols ”.499  Thus in Agricultural Household ‘Skif O’, the Supreme Court found that \n“PERSON_1 could not have learned about the meeting on 25 January 2013, since during this period he \ndid not act as the head of the farm, and therefore was not aware of the adoption of the appealed decision ” (at \n[4.10] {C9.8/39/8}). \n(e) Attribution of knowledge to a corporate claimant  \n576 It is common ground that there is no specific rule in the CC (or any other statute) stipulating \nwhose knowledge is to be attributed to a company (whether generally or for the specific \npurposes of Art. 261 CC).500 It is also agreed that “ the knowledge of a person who is authorised to \nact on behalf of a company will not be attributed to that company if such person aims to defraud it ”.501  \n577 Mr Beketov’s view is that a Ukrainian court would “ take a common sense approach to questions of \nattribution of knowledge ” and would likely place significant weight upon “ the degree to which the \nperson whose knowledge is sought to be attributed to a company was in a position to exercise influence over \nthe management or business of the company, whether through formal or informal means ”.502   \n578 In his first report, Mr Beketov opined that the knowledge of the Bank’s Management Board \nwas more likely to be applicable than that of the Supervisory Board, “ because … the Bank’s \nManagement Board, and not its Supervisory Board, a"}

His reasoning has remained \nconsistent throughout: “ it is the knowledge of those persons authorised to decide whether the Bank will \nbring a claim that is primarily relevant to consider when applying a common sense approach as to whose \nknowledge should be attributed to the Bank for the purposes of limitation ”.504  \n579 Despite his protestations to the contrary,505 the same cannot be said for Mr Alyoshin, or, \nindeed, for D1 generally. The timeline of their ever-shifting case can be charted as follows: \n(1) Defence (January 2020): D1 did not identify whose knowledge he said was relevant \nfor the purposes of his limitation defence (notwithstanding that his pleaded case is \nsolely on an allegation of actual (not constructive) knowledge): {A1/8/49-50}.  \n(2) Disclosure (June/November 2020): Disclosure issue 32.1 (“ Limitation ”) was \nformulated thus: “[ w]hat knowledge did any members of the Management Board have prior to 21 \nDecember 2014 of the facts and matters on which the Bank now relies in support of its claims ...? ” \n{A4/2/11-13}. This careful drafting was reached after debate with Mann J: \nMann J : ... Let’s nail this down a little more. For practical purposes, if there was a fraud ... \nthe limitation period starts running when somebody relevant knew or ought to have known, \nyou will have to run a factual case as to who it is [that] is relevant who knew or ought to have \nknown. \nD1’s Leading Counsel : Yes. \nMann J : And who is that? \nD1’s Leading Counsel : The reason why I was showing you Mr Beketov’s report was his \nreference to the knowledge of the management body with the authority to bring a claim. \nMann J : Right. So it is the knowledge of that body which will be the focus of any enquiry. \nD1’s Leading Counsel : That’s right, the Bank’s management committee. \nMann J : So what this boils down to is ... documents going to the knowledge of the \nmanagement body of the facts relevant to this claim? … \nD1’s Leading Counsel : Yes. ... we can narrow it. We can say: did the Bank’s management \ncommittee learn of the facts and matters? ... \nMann J : [to D2 and D3-8’s counsel ] Are you adding anything? \nD2’s Leading Counsel : Nothing to add, my Lord.

Therefore, a \nUkrainian court would consider the knowledge of members of the Management Board \nto be relevant for purpose of limitation in respect of the Bank’s claims in these \nproceedings.”  \nSee also ¶300 {C7/1/98}, referring to “ the Bank officials responsible for preparing or filing \nlawsuits on behalf of the Bank … ”. The primary basis for Mr Alyoshin’s disagreement \nwith Mr Beketov’s view was said to be that “ a test based on ‘common sense’ would be unclear \nand unpredictable ” {C7/1/102} (¶314). \n(5) D1’s written opening (5 June 2023): D1 contended that “[ w]hat primarily matters is the \nknowledge of the Bank’s management board and its other duly authorized representatives including \nmembers of the Credit Committee who approved the Relevant Loans. All decisions in relation to the \nRelevant Loans were taken by Mr Dubilet and the Bank’s Credit Committee and their knowledge \nis to be attributed to the Bank ”.508 D1’s focus was thus still on the Management Board, \nbut now (for the first time) with a drift to the ECC as well. \n(6) D1’s oral opening (19 June 2023): A fortnight later, D1 cast the net much wider: \n“... if we turn to whose knowledge does and doesn’t count for these purposes, we say \nthe court needs to look and consider carefully the following: we’ve got firstly the \nmanagement committee of the Bank; secondly, members of the Bank’s electronic credit \ncommittee, which is the relevant credit committee that approved the loans; thirdly, the \nBank’s legal department who handled claims against the suppliers and the Bank brought \nby the relevant borrowers.” {Day6/88:1-20} \n(7) Further expert evidence (September 2023): By the time of his fourth report and after \nhe had seen the Bank’s Charter point,  Mr Alyoshin’s view had changed completely: \nhe now “ disagree [d] with Mr Beketov that it is the knowledge of the members of the body that is \n \n506  Alyoshin1/¶¶285-286 {C2/1/105}, ¶289 {C2/1/106}; UkrJR/¶109.2 {C5/1/42}. \n507  Mr Nahnybida agreed with Mr Alyoshin’s view: Nahnybida3/¶75 {C4/1/13}. \n508  D1 Opening/¶273(1) {AA3/1/90-91}. \nAA2/15/309\n303 authorised to initiate legal proceedings that is ‘primarily’ relevant for the purposes of determining when \nthe limitation period starts to run ”,509 and suggested instead that “ the knowledge of any \nindividual  performing his/her duties is pertinent to determining whe"}

The “ relevant context ” must be that of \nbringing a claim: as the Supreme Court has stated, “ … the start of the running of a limitation \nperiod coincides with the moment when the right to a claim arises with the interested person, meaning \nthe possibility for this person to enforce its rights through the court ”.514 The distinction Mr \nAlyoshin sought to draw in XX between “ commencing a claim ” and “ starting a limitation \nperiod ” {Day30/73:10} - {Day30/75:13} was novel and nonsensical. \n(2) In advancing his new argument that the relevant knowledge is that of “ an individual … \nwho is allocated or delegated with the relevant duties or powers ”, Mr Alyoshin relied upon the \nGuivan article referred to above.515 However, Guivan only referred to the need to \nconsider the knowledge of “ persons whose powers related to the relevant area of activity ”;516 the \nreference to a much wider group of people who would have relevant “ duties ” was Mr \nAlyoshin’s own addition, and finds no support either in Guivan’s article (as Mr \nAlyoshin agreed517) or in any other authority.

SFG Hermes was at all relevant times a one-man \ncompany; the only “ someone ” was the ‘one man’ who acted as its \ndirector/representative: Alyoshin XX {Day30/85:23} - {Day30/86:20}.  \n(f) Disapplication of the limitation period \n581 Art. 267(5) (“ Consequences of the expiry of the limitation period ”) {C1/6/8-9} states that “[ if] a court \nfinds any reason for missing the limitation period to be valid, any violated right shall be protected ”. It is \ncommon ground that “ the application of [Art.] 267(5) is heavily fact dependent and must be decided on \na case-by-case basis ”,521 and that the key question is whether there are “ objective reasons beyond the \nclaimant’s control that prevented or significantly hindered the claimant from bringing the action in due \ntime”.522 \n582 In applying this test, the Supreme Court has frequently emphasised the width of the court’s \ndiscretion. For example, in Tamira, it said at {C2/107/39} that: \n \n518  Judgment of the ECtHR in Joffre de la Pradelle v. France of 16.12.92, quoted in SFG Hermes at {C9.7/11/19}. \n519  Alyoshin2/¶288 ff {C7/1/94}; Alyoshin4/¶15 {C9.7/1/7}; UkrJR/¶100.2 {C5/1/39}.  \n520  Alyoshin2/¶¶289-290 {C7/1/95}, citing Mayor of Rivne, decision of the Supreme Court dated 20.4.21 in Case \nNo. 569/933/18 {C7/76} (claimants brought a claim in 2017 to invalidate a sale agreement made in 1998), \nand Combine of Production Enterprises, decision of the Supreme Court dated 25.11.20 in Case No. \n206/6957/15 {C7/77} (claimant brought a claim in 2015 seeking to recover payments he alleged he should \nhave received when he left the Enterprise in 2004).  \n521  UkrJR/¶103.2 {C5/1/40}; Alyoshin XX {Day30/131:10-15}. \n522  UkrJR/¶103.3 {C5/1/40}, by reference to Resolution No. 10 of the Plenary Meeting  of the High Commercial \nCourt dated 29.5.13 {C1/198}. \nAA2/15/311\n305 “The panel of judges also agrees with the statement of the commercial court of appeal that \nthe law does not specify the list of reasons that may be found to be valid for the protection \nof a violated right if a claim is filed after the limitation period has expired. Therefore, the \npowers to resolve this issue are vested directly in a jurisdictional authority - the court that \nhears the case on the merits with due regard to all the circumstances of the case and based on \nthe assessment of evidence presented.” \n583 And in Talant {C2/109/8}: \n“The conclusion on the validity of reasons for filing a lawsuit after expiry of the limitation \nperiod can be reached only after examining all facts and examining evidence in each specific \ncase. At the same time, valid reasons for filing a lawsuit after expiry of the limitation period \nare deemed such circumstances that make timely filing of a claim impossible or difficult.” \n584 The Supreme Court has also frequently emphasised the importance of applying Art. 267(5) \nin line with Ukraine’s ECHR obligations. Thus in Talant (at{C2/109/8}), and in SFG \nHermes (at ¶5.84 {C9.7/11/19}, with slight variations in the translation), it said that: \n“… the European Court of Human Rights in case ‘Ilian v.

For these reasons, the application of statutes of limitation is subject to the general \nprinciples of substantive civil law, which are of a fundamental nature and are norms of direct \neffect (Supreme Court ruling of January 25, 2021 in case No. 758/10761/13-ts), including \ngeneral provisions on justice, good faith and reasonableness as a general standard of behavior \nof participants in civil legal relations.  \n94.6. In the considered aspect, in particular, this significantly weakens the position of the \ndefendants who are involved in the fraudulent transaction and are defending themselves \nagainst the lawsuit to declare such transaction invalid and derivative lawsuits with reference \nto the omission of the limitation periods by the claimant, because according to the meaning \nof paragraph 3 of Article 16 of the Civil Code of Ukraine in case of establishing an abuse of \nright, the court may refuse the protection of the person. The provision applies not only to the \nclaimant who asks for certain remedies, but also to the defendant who is defended against the \nclaim by raising certain objections (including claiming that the claimant has missed the \nlimitation period).” \n586 Mr Alyoshin acknowledged in XX that this was “ valid Ukrainian jurisprudence ”: \n{Day30/123:19-24}, and that his previous view that “ there is no need to apply Article 16(3) in \nthis context and it would not be appropriate to do so ”523, following Sirius-Bud, could not stand.524  \n \n523  Alyoshin1/¶299 {C2/1/109}. \n524  Alyoshin XX {Day30/126:13} - {Day30/127:1}; Alyoshin2/¶304 {C7/1/99}. \nAA2/15/312\n306 This was an improvement on Mr Nahnybida, who, despite filing his supplemental report in \nOctober 2022 ( i.e. nearly a year after Sirius-Bud), continued to assert that “ I can see no possible \nsuch interconnection between Articles 13(3), 16(3) and Article 267(5) of the Civil Code ”.525 \n587 There was a dispute between Mr Beketov and Mr Alyoshin as to whether the doctrine of \nabuse of rights was a separate ground for disapplying the limitation period, or rather a \nprinciple which the court was required to take into account in exercising its discretion to \ndisapply under Art. 267(5).526  For the purposes of the present case, this debate is unlikely to \nmatter much; what is important is that the court’s discretion to disapply the limitation period \nmust be applied with due regard to the prohibition against abuse of rights ( i.e. using the right \nto a limitation defence “ for an illegitimate purpose ” – see Section I  above) and the Art. 3(1) \ngeneral principles.  \n588 In addition to establishing this point of principle, Sirius-Bud is also instructive in its analysis \nof how the Supreme Court conducts the disapplication exercise.527 At [95.2] – [95.3] \n{C7/78/40}, the Supreme Court concluded as follows: \n“95.2.

Sirius-Bud was subsequently declared \nbankrupt, initially in October 2018, and then again (after that decision was overturned on appeal) in \nAugust 2019. The authority of its previous management was revoked from 14.8.19: [1]-[3] {C7/78/3}.  \n The Supreme Court found (as summarised at [80.1] {C7/78/30-31}) that ( i) the signature on the \nvaluation report prepared for the auction was forged; ( ii) the valuation report had massively under-\nestimated (by 15 times) the value of the property; ( iii) Sirius-Bud had not disputed the results of the \nvaluation or the auction itself; and ( iv) except for the disputed property, Sirius-Bud had no other readily \navailable assets from which it could satisfy the demands of creditors. The Court concluded that that these \nfactors “ give grounds for the conclusion that the alienation of the property … corresponds to the signs of a fraudulent \ntransaction, which can be declared invalid as being committed in bad faith, to the detriment of creditors ” (at [80.2] \n{C7/78/31}). \n A limitation defence was raised,  given that the disputed auction was held on 5.5.17, but the liquidator of \nSirius-Bud had not filed a claim until March 2021 “ beyond the three-year limitation period ”: [93.1] {C7/78/38}. \n{AA2/15/222}\nAA2/15/313\n307 periods both with regard to the claim to invalidate the results of the disputed auctions and \nwith regard to the vindication claim can be considered valid.” \n589 As this passage reveals, the fraudulent conduct of Sirius-Bud’s previous management, and \nthe fact that the company lacked “ external independent management ”, were both factors justifying \nthe extension of the limitation period. Mr Alyoshin agreed: {Day30/132:2-9}. Indeed, in his \nsecond report, Mr Alyoshin expressly acknowledged that “[ i]f in practice the First and Second \nDefendants or the influence they exerted prevented the Bank’s officials responsible for preparing or filing \nlawsuits on behalf of the Bank from doing so then, in theory, that could provide a ground for disapplying the \nlimitation ”.528 The Supreme Court applied this approach notwithstanding that the three-year \nlimitation"}

Specifically, clause 9.3.3(34) (as it \nappeared in all versions of the Charter between 2012 until April 2015529) provides as \nfollows:530 \n“The competence of the Supervisory Board includes: … \n(34) taking decision on holding the officials of the Bank’s management bodies personally \nliable; … \nThe powers provided for in paragraphs 1 to 23 and in paragraphs 25 to 46 belong to the \nexclusive competence of the Supervisory Board and cannot be decided by other authorities \nof the Bank other than the Bank’s general meeting.” \nClause 9.3.3(34) of the Bank’s Charter {K1/228/28-29}  \nClause 9.1.1 of the Charter defines the Bank’s management bodies as the Supervisory Board, \nthe Management Board and the general meeting of shareholders {K1/228/13}. \n592 Mr Beketov considered that the effect of clause 9.3.3(34) was to reserve the power to bring \nproceedings against D1-2, as members of the Supervisory Board and thus “ officials of the \n \n528  Alyoshin2/¶300 {C7/1/98}.  \n529  Versions approved on 26.4.13 {K1/227.1/29}, 25.4.14 {K1/228/28}, 10.2.15 {K1/229/28}, 26-30.4.15 \n{K1/230/30} and 10.7.15 {K1/231/29}. A convenient hand-up is at {AA6/15/1}.  \n530  This is the version of the Charter which was in force between 25.4.14 and 10.2.15. \nAA2/15/314\n308 Bank’s management bodies ”, exclusively to the Supervisory Board (and general meeting). \nAccordingly, in his view:531 \n“…a Ukrainian court would consider the knowledge of members of the Supervisory Board \n(and General Meeting of Shareholders), and not its Management Board, to be relevant for \npurposes of determining when limitation started to run in relation to claims such as those \nbrought by the Bank against the First and Second Defendants in the current proceedings.” \n593 Mr Alyoshin disagreed, for reasons set out in his fourth report {C9.7/1}. None of those \nreasons withstands scrutiny. In summary: \n594 First, he said that the reference to “ management bodies ” in clause 9.3.3.(34) did not include the \nSupervisory Board, but only the Management Board and other lower-ranking officials.532 But \nthis argument ignores clause 9.1.1 of the Charter {K1/228/13} (see above), which expressly \ndefines the Bank’s “ management bodies ” to include the Supervisory Board. It also ignores clause \n9.1.3 {K1/228/14}, which states that “[ o]fficers of the Bank’s management bodies are defined in \naccordance with ” the JSC Law; as set out at Section I   above, “ officers ” are defined in Art. \n2(1)(15) of the JSC Law {C1/22/1} to include “ the chairman and members of the supervisory \nboard ”.533 On Mr Alyoshin’s own case, “ primary consideration shall be given ”, in interpreting the \nCharter,  “to the consistent meanings of words and concepts throughout the transaction, as well as to the \ndefinitions commonly accepted within the relevant field of relations ”.534 Those interpretative principles \ncan only lead to the conclu"}
{"start": 868000, "text": "set out at Section I   above, “ officers ” are defined in Art. \n2(1)(15) of the JSC Law {C1/22/1} to include “ the chairman and members of the supervisory \nboard ”.533 On Mr Alyoshin’s own case, “ primary consideration shall be given ”, in interpreting the \nCharter,  “to the consistent meanings of words and concepts throughout the transaction, as well as to the \ndefinitions commonly accepted within the relevant field of relations ”.534 Those interpretative principles \ncan only lead to the conclusion that “ management bodies ” does indeed include the Supervisory \nBoard. When the point was put to him in XX, Mr Alyoshin could offer no explanation to \nthe contrary; his refusal to give ground here was a good illustration of his lack of \nindependence.535 \n595 Secondly, Mr Alyoshin contended that clause 9.3.3(34) did not relate to the bringing of court \nproceedings against ( inter alios ) Supervisory Board members at all, but instead to a “ specific \ntype of procedure ”,536 set out in Art. 136 of the Labour Code {C9.7/15/3}, which permits a \ncompany unilaterally to dock an employee’s wages as a response to (internally-determined) \nmisconduct.537 As to that: \n(1) As a preliminary point, there was a dispute between Mr Beketov and Mr Alyoshin as \nto whether the Charter should be interpreted as a “ local normative act ” i.e. akin to a \n \n531  Beketov13/¶8 {C9.5/1/4}. \n532  Alyoshin4/¶40 {C9.7/1/17}. \n533  All of which Mr Beketov pointed out at Beketov13/¶6, fn. 2 {C9.5/1/4}.  \n534  Alyoshin4/¶29 {C9.7/1/3}.  \n535  Alyoshin XX {Day30/91:8} - {Day30/92:25}. \n536  Alyoshin4/¶31 {C9.7/1/14}. \n537  Alyoshin4/¶¶30-39 {C9.7/1/13-17}. \n{AA2/15/222}\nAA2/15/315\n309 statute (Mr Beketov) or as a contract/transaction (Mr Alyoshin).538 This is of little \nsignificance in practical terms: either way, deciding upon the proper interpretation to \nbe accorded to the Charter is a matter for the Court,539 taking into account other \nprovisions of the Charter, and how terms used in the Charter are generally understood.  \n(2) As to that, the starting point is that there is no reference to the Labour Code in the \nCharter (as Mr Alyoshin accepted in XX: {Day30/93:17-19}). Nor does the regime \nset out in Art. 136 of the Labour Code {C9.7/15/3} provide an obvious analogue to \nthe power to “ tak[e] decisions on holding the officials of the Bank’s management personally liable ” \nprovided for in clause 9.3.3(34): instead, Art. 136 sets down an internal procedure by \nwhich the general employee population may have their wages docked, up to a \nmaximum of their average monthly salary, for damages caused by breach of their \nemployment duties. Larger claims are not subject to that procedure: in such cases, “ the \nemployer is required to file a claim with the local general court ”.540 Had the drafters of the \nCharter intended to refer to the Art. 136 procedure when including clause 9.3.3(34), \nthey would have referred to it more specifically. That conclusion is reached both by \nthe plain language of clause 9.3.3(34), and also as a matter of logic: Mr Alyoshin had \nno good answer to this question:  “[g]iven that officials have unlimited liability and the main \nmechanism for holding them liable is to go to court, why on earth would the Bank reserve the relatively \ninconsequential statutory power to deduct a month’s salary to the exclusive competence of the \nsupervisory board but leave the main means of holding an official liable, going to court, somehow to \nsome other jurisdiction? ” {Day30/104:16-25}.  \n(3) Clause 9.3.3(34) has a much more obvious source, namely Art. 41 of the Law on \nBusiness Companies, which provides at Art. 41(g) that the general meeting of \nshareholders of legal entities to which Art. 41 applies (which, prior to the introduction \nof the JSC Law and for two years thereafter, include joint stock companies such as the \nBank541) has the power to “ adopt[] decisions on bringing officials of company’s management bodies \nto property liability ” {C9.12/13/2}.542 M"}
{"start": 871500, "text": "y30/104:16-25}.  \n(3) Clause 9.3.3(34) has a much more obvious source, namely Art. 41 of the Law on \nBusiness Companies, which provides at Art. 41(g) that the general meeting of \nshareholders of legal entities to which Art. 41 applies (which, prior to the introduction \nof the JSC Law and for two years thereafter, include joint stock companies such as the \nBank541) has the power to “ adopt[] decisions on bringing officials of company’s management bodies \nto property liability ” {C9.12/13/2}.542 Mr Alyoshin agreed in XX that clause 9.3.3(34) \nwas “ practically identical ” to, and likely taken from, Art. 41(g).543 He volunteered that \n \n538  Beketov13/¶¶9-12 {C9.5/1/5}; Alyoshin4/¶¶23-29 {C9.7/1/10}.  \n539  Alyoshin4/¶23 {C9.7/1/10}; Alyoshin XX {Day30/89:17} - {Day30/91:7}; Beketov XX {Day28/121:2-3}. \n540  See Arts. 130, 132 and 136 {C9.7/15/2-3}; Alyoshin XX {Day30/101:13} - {Day30/104:15}. \n541  See clause 2 of the Final and Transitional Provisions of the initial version of the JSC Law dated 17.9.08 \n{C9.12/14/1}. \n542  {C9.12/13/2} is the version of Art. 41 as at 20.6.07. The versions as of 5.11.08 and 30.12.09, which contain \nthe same provision, are at {C9.12/13/4} and {C9.12/13/6} respectively.  \n543  Alyoshin XX {Day30/97:17-20}. \nAA2/15/316\n310 “because the first time it  [i.e. the wording ] appeared in the law in Ukraine on business company … \nand at that time it was practice in Ukraine, when preparing charter, just to copy-paste these provisions \nof the law to the charters, and this was done ” {Day30/94:10-25}. He further volunteered \nthat he had appreciated as much at the time he had written his fourth report, it had \nbeen “ my intention originally to provide a little bit history of that ”, but that he had ultimately \ndecided not to do so because “ it adds nothing, I think ”.544 Quite why Mr Alyoshin \nconsidered Art. 41(g) ( i.e. the admitted source of clause 9.3.3(34)) to be irrelevant, but \nthe provisions of the Labour Code ( i.e. an entirely unrelated provision in completely \ndifferent terms) to be relevant, is obvious: because the latter could be used to construct \nan argument in D1’s favour, whereas the former could not.  \n(4) As a further point of distinction, clause 9.3.3(34), like Art. 41, uses the term “ property \nliability” (‘майнової відповідальності’), alternatively translated as ‘personal liability’). \nIn contrast, the Labour Code uses the term “ material liability ” (‘матеріальної \nвідповідальності’) or “material damage ” (‘матеріальноı̈ шкоди’). That is not a \ndifference in translation: the two are distinct terms under Ukrainian law with \nrecognised, significant differences.545  \n596 On the facts of this case therefore:  \n(1) The only bodies that could authorise the bringing of proceedings against D1-2 were \n(i) the Supervisory Board; or ( ii) the general meeting of shareholders.  \n(2) D1-2 made up a two thirds majority on the Supervisory Board until the end of April \n2015, and held a 90%+ shareholding in the Bank at all times between 2014 and the \nnationalisation. Thus, without their sanction, no resolution authorising the bringing \nof proceedings could ever have been passed.  \n(3) Accordingly, whether on a common sense approach, pursuant to which the knowledge \nof persons authorised to decide whether the Bank will bring a claim is primarily \nrelevant  (as Mr Beketov advocates) or by reference to Art. 92 CC and the question of \n“who is authorised to act on the company’s behalf in the relevant context ” (as Mr Alyoshin \n \n544  Alyoshin XX {Day30/95:12-16}. \n545  See the Supreme Court in Ukrposhta at {C9.12/15/6}, stating that the two types of liability “ differ significantly \nfrom each other in terms of legal nature ”, and that “[ m]aterial liability is an institution of labour law … Property liability is a \ncivil law category.

See also, as a practical example of a general meeting of \nshareholders exercising its power to bring an official of the company to “ property liability ”, Republican House \nof Footwear Models at {C9.12/7/12-13}. \nAA2/15/317\n311 originally advocated),546 the answer is the same: it is the knowledge of D1-2 which is \nprima facie  attributable to the Bank.  \n(4) However, given that it is common ground that “ the knowledge of a person who is authorised \nto act on behalf of a company will not be attributed to that company if such person aims to defraud \nit”,547 D1-2’s knowledge cannot be attributed to the Bank so as to start limitation \nrunning.  \n(5) It therefore follows that time cannot have started to run before December 2014, as at \nall relevant times up to that point, the power to bring proceedings lay exclusively with \nthe Supervisory Board (the Bank’s Charter was only amended in April 2015 to render \nthe clause 9.3.3(34) power within the non-exclusive competence of the Supervisory \nBoard and general meeting).  \n(6) Since the Bank’s claims in these proceedings were filed in December 2017, they were \ntherefore brought within the three-year limitation period provided for by Art. 257 CC.  \n(4) Knowledge of Other Employees of the Bank  \n(a) D1’s pleaded case: a defective plea of actual knowledge \n597 D1 pleads that: “[ t]he Bank knew of the facts and matters on which its claim is based before December \n2014… ” {A1/8/49-50} (¶86).There are two points to note about this at the outset.  \n598 First, there is no plea to the effect that the Bank ought to have known of the relevant facts \nand matters before this date i.e. no plea of constructive knowledge. The same is true for D3-\n8.548 Whilst D2 does plead actual or constructive knowledge,549 he does so only on a very \nlimited basis (which does not include the Glavcom Article or, indeed, any other article). \n599 The Bank notes that D1 submitted in opening that even if the Bank had not acquired actual \nknowledge, it had constructive knowledge as a result of the Ukrainian Proceedings and the \nGlavcom article.550 On that basis, he said that time started to run “ within days of [the publication \nof the Glavcom article on ] 7 November ” {Day6/108:1-7}. That case would be unsustainable in \nany event, but it is not pleaded and is not one which it is open to D1 to advance. \n \n546  Alyoshin1/¶286 {C2/1/105}. \n547  UkrJR/¶110.3 {C5/1/43}. \n548  D3-8Def/¶63 {A1/20/32}. \n549  D2Def/¶54(1) {A1/18/27-28}. \n550  D1 Opening/¶276 {AA3/1/92}. \nAA2/15/318\n312 600 Secondly, D1 nowhere pleads or particularises which individual(s) at the Bank he says had \nactual knowledge. That failure is compounded by the ever-shifting case on attribution, noted \nabove. \n(b) D1’s pleaded case: matters said to give rise to actual knowledge \n601 Leaving aside the central issue of ‘whose knowledge’ matters, D1’s pleaded case of actual \nknowledge  is particularised by reference to five specific facts: ( i) the Bank knew of and \nauthorised the Relevant Loans; ( ii) the Relevant Drawdowns were made before September \n2014; ( iii) the Bank was a party to the proceedings giving rise to the 2014 Ukrainian \nJudgments; ( iv) the Glavcom article was published on 7.11.14; and ( v) the Ukrainian GPO \ninstigated a criminal investigation in relation to allegations regarding “ some of ” the Borrowers \nand D3-8, which were “ similar ” to the Bank’s allegations in these proceedings.

D2 and D3-\n8 plead similar points to ( i) and ( ii) above,551 whilst D3-8 also plead that the Bank was aware \nof the transfers in and out of their accounts.552 \n602 These facts fall miles short of those necessary to enable the Bank to plead a claim dealing \nwith all four elements of tort liability under Art. 1166 CC. \n603 First, points ( i), (ii) and ( iii) relied upon by D1 would simply have revealed to the person \nconducting any investigation (as to which, see further below) that the Relevant Loans had \nbeen granted and drawn down. They would not have addressed three further key points, viz.: \n(1) Whether D1-2 were the true owners and controllers of the Borrowers/D3-8.  \n(2) The unlawfulness of any acts or omissions by D1-2.  \n(3) What loss had been caused by the Relevant Drawdowns.  \n604 Secondly, so far as the Glavcom article (D1’s point ( iv)) is concerned: \n(1) It was limited to 30 of the 50 Borrowers: D1 Opening/¶277(2) {AA3/1/92}. \n(2) It provided only limited assistance in connecting certain Borrowers and Trade Point \nAgro to D1-2: see the top of {E7/8/7}.  \n605 Thirdly, the GPO investigation (D1’s point ( v)) is a point in the Bank’s favour. The \nchronology here is as follows:  \n \n551  D2Def/¶5(5) {A1/18/3}, ¶54 {A1/18/27-28}; D3-8Def/¶63(1) {A1/20/32}. \n552  D3-8Def/¶63(2) {A1/20/32}. \nAA2/15/319\n313 (1) On 13.11.14, the GPO instituted a pre-trial investigation No. 4201 4000 0000 01261 \n{E15/206/2}. It related to the “ misappropriation by [Bank ] officials of another’s property, \nnamely state funds of the [NBU ] allocated for refinancing ” {E7/264.01}. \n(2) On 5.1.15, a Senior Investigator in the GPO sent the Bank a “ ruling ... on discovery of \ndocuments ” in connection with the investigation {E7/187.2}. \n(3) On 14.1.15, the Bank responded to the GPO’s 5.1.15 ruling, refusing to provide the \ndocuments sought {E7/261.1}. \n(4) On 21.1.15, the Bank’s legal department wrote to Shmalchenko to say that “[ d]ue to the \nfact that the investigator’s ruling does not comply with the rules of the Criminal Procedure Code of \nUkraine, [we] prepared and sent a refusal. ... please be advised that the [GPO ] will now apply to the \ncourt for a decision granting temporary access to the bank’s property and documents, and bank \nemployees may be summoned for questioning… ” {E7/264.01}. \n(5) So: the GPO got nowhere in the 2+ months after publication of the Glavcom Article; \nand the Bank refused to provide information voluntarily. \n(6) Indeed, when the GPO’s investigation eventually caused it to obtain freezing orders \nover bank accounts maintained by D4 and D6-8 in July/August 2016, D1 quickly \ninstructed lawyers on behalf of those companies and had the orders discharged by \nmid-September 2016: see above.  \n606 In short, D1’s pleaded case on knowledge gets him nowhere close to establishing that the \nBank knew enough about ( i) the Misappropriation, ( ii) D1-2’s involvement in the same and \n(iii) the Bank’s loss, to be able to bring a claim by December 2014.  \n(c) What would have happened if an innocent member of staff had started to investigate? \n607 In XX of some of the Bank’s factual witnesses D1 seemed to be advancing a case based on \na hypothetical blowing of the whistle by a hypothetical innocent manager at the Bank.

See: \nAA2/15/320\n314 (1) {Day6/105:11-14}: “ what you see is Glavcom goes a long way to putting things together. ... we’re \nnot saying everything in it is right ”553; \n(2) {Day6/105:25} - {Day6/106:3}: “[ s]o anyone who investigated would have discovered, if not \nthe entirety, a large part of what the Bank is currently saying. There’s certainly enough to have started \na train of enquiry ”; and \n(3) {Day6/113:17-20}: “ anyone investigating would have identified that certain repayments of the \nloans had been made by [intermediary ] loans despite non-delivery of the goods ”.  \n609 Accordingly, D1 accepts that further investigations into the allegations in the Glavcom \nArticle were necessary, albeit he unrealistically downplays the nature and practicality (given \nD1-2’s control of the Bank) of such investigations. \n(i) Anyone investigating D1-2 would have been sacked \n610 What, then, would have happened had a member of Bank staff started to investigate D1-2? \nThey would, at a minimum, have had their employment terminated; and the consequences \n– both personal and professional – would likely have been far greater than that.554 \n611 The character and reputation of D1 is of paramount importance in that regard: \n(1) The Court has heard unchallenged evidence from Ms Rozhkova that D1 made serious \nthreats against her, including ( i) to release her private phone records and messages \ninto the public domain; ( ii) that he could find her anywhere and comparing himself to \n“a hungry tiger in a cage ”;555 and ( iii) organising a protest outside her home whilst her \neight-year-old daughter was at home, requiring her to take a police escort to work556 \n(and then bragging about it with D2 over WhatsApp: {K5-A2/6/43}). \n(2) NBU Governor Valeriya Gontareva has told the press that D1 also threatened her. In \nNovember 2019, when she was recovering from a hit-and-run attack in London, she \ngave an interview to the Guardian, in which she recounted the following exchange \nwith D1: “ The first thing he said to me was ‘Valeria ... you are without any bodyguards. Do you \nknow it only costs $10,000 to have someone killed in this country?’. I told him I had bodyguards, \n \n553  For example, Glavcom asserts that “All these loans were issued in summer 2014 after the bank had received financial \nassistance from the state ...” {E7/8/2}; this is wrong – a number of the loans referred to in the 2014 Ukrainian \nJudgments were entered into before May 2014. \n554  As Ms Rozhkova explained, “ if the management board member needs to clarify something, the management board member \nshould go to the supervisory board and try to clarify the issue with representatives of shareholders ” {Day8/13:23} - \n{Day8/14:1}. In other words, D1-2 would have known about the fledgling investigation straight away. \n555  Rozhkova1/¶¶215-218 {B1/5/53-54}. \n556  {Day8/4:15} - {Day8/5:15}. \nAA2/15/321\n315 which was a lie. And he said: ‘Ah, with guards it will cost ... 100k’ ” {H1/46.5/2}. Ms \nRozhkova also recounted that “ in 2017, a coffin was also placed outside the NBU, which \ncontained a cut-out of [Ms Gontareva’s ] head; in 2019, her son’s family car was set on fire in Kyiv; \n[and] her family home in Kyiv was burned down days later ”: Rozhkova1/¶288 {B1/5/68}. \n(3) D1 was at the time the Governor of Dnipro,557 where the Bank and the majority of its \npersonnel were based.

Ms \nRozhkova also recounted that “ in 2017, a coffin was also placed outside the NBU, which \ncontained a cut-out of [Ms Gontareva’s ] head; in 2019, her son’s family car was set on fire in Kyiv; \n[and] her family home in Kyiv was burned down days later ”: Rozhkova1/¶288 {B1/5/68}. \n(3) D1 was at the time the Governor of Dnipro,557 where the Bank and the majority of its \npersonnel were based. During 2014 D1 was responsible for “ organising and supporting ” \na private militia (or “ volunteer battalion ”), which he says was “ critical to the maintenance of \npublic order ”.558 D1’s “ Dnipro battalion ” was reported to have been made up of “ 2,000 \nheavily armed fighters ”, whilst he was said to have had over 20,000 troops at his disposal \nin total {H1/10.6.2/1}. In December 2014, i.e. at the very same time that Bank staff \nsupposedly had a six-week window to investigate D1-2’s conduct, the New York \nTimes reported that D1 was “ flouting central authority by interdicting aid convoys headed to the \nDonbas and permitting brigades he finances to engage in activities that contravene the law ” \n{H1/46.3/2}. \n(4) The Court has seen video footage of D1 using armed men in combat fatigues and ski \nmasks to seize the offices of the majority state-owned Ukrtransnafta \n{Day16/108:10} ff, {H1/46.1}.559 \n(5) The lengths to which D1-2 were prepared to go to prevent legal proceedings being \nbrought against them is evident from their actions after nationalisation. They included \n(i) D1 and D2 working together in December 2017 to seek and obtain an injunction \nagainst Hogan Lovells to prevent the Bank bringing this claim at all;560 (ii) D1 obtaining \nconfidential details of the meeting of the Bank’s (post-nationalisation) Supervisory \nBoard at which the decision to launch these proceedings was made;561 (iii) D2 paying \nhis wife £7m in September 2017 to leave England in an attempt to sever his ties to \nthis jurisdiction and threatening to cut off financial support to his own children if she \ndid not: her evidence is that “ I felt under pressure from Gennadiy as he said that if I did not \nleave England he would no longer support me financially. I, therefore, reluctantly agreed to move with \nthe children to Switzerland  ….”;562  (iv) D1 issuing defamation proceedings and procuring \n \n557  Kolomoisky1/¶¶21 ff {H2/1/5}.

His concern \nwas understandable: later, in July 2019, D1 and Dubilet exchanged WhatsApp \nmessages about getting the local police to bring in the Bank’s then CEO, Petr \nKrumphanzl, for questioning; six hours after sending his initial message, Dubilet \nwrote: “ Thank you!!!! Three police officers told Bolotin [sc. the Bank’s Head of Security ] that if \nKrumphanzl doesn’t come in, they will bring him in forcibly ”: see above.

Three police officers told Bolotin [sc. the Bank’s Head of Security ] that if \nKrumphanzl doesn’t come in, they will bring him in forcibly ”: see above. In circumstances \nwhere, even after nationalisation, a very senior member of the Bank’s new \nmanagement was, for understandable reasons, unwilling to go against D1-2, it is \ninconceivable that a member of its pre-nationalisation management or staff would \nhave done so. \n612 It is, frankly, incredible in those circumstances to suggest that any ‘innocent’ Management \nBoard member, still less a junior legal department employee, would have sought to \ninvestigate allegations of a billion-dollar fraud perpetrated by D1-2 against the Bank in late \n2014.  \n613 Indeed, that much was (unwittingly) accepted by D1’s own counsel, when he put to Mr \nOleksiyenko that “ a reasonable conclusion is that there were people inside the Bank prior to 7 November \n2014 who observed what was going on and could be seen from the judgments in the Ukrainian proceedings, \nand those people decided to tip off the journalist? ” {Day10/47:19-24}. As to this: \n(1) Why, one asks, would someone inside the Bank decide to tip off a journalist rather \nthan report their concerns up the chain of command? The answer is obvious: because \nno-one within the Bank in 2014 would have dreamt of challenging D1-2 by suggesting \nthat their own bank sue them for billions of dollars.  \n \n563  Bank Opening/¶¶335-340 {AA2/1/141-143}. \n564  Bank Opening/¶¶341-342 {AA2/1/143-144}. \nAA2/15/323\n317 (2) See further, in this regard, the Bank’s internal responses to publication of the Glavcom \nArticle in November 2014 and the later Nashi Groshi articles in February 2015: \n(a) Glavcom: on 13.11.14, Linsky was forwarded information about the Nashi \nGroshi articles on Pikush’s instructions {E7/36.01/2}. The two men must have \nthen spoken because, on 14.11.14, Linsky emailed Pikush saying “ here is what I \nhave been able to find out. There are quite a few people in the bank who have access to this \ninformation. This is probably the problem ” {E7/36.01}. Pikush responded: “ I wonder \nwho can see the whole tables ” (ibid.).  \n(b) Nashi Groshi: on 12.2.15, Pikush instituted another witch hunt: at 1.24 pm, Mr \nLuchaninov sent an email to Sokolovskiy (Head of Internal Audit) and \nKryzhanovskiy (Head of Security, Management Board member) saying that \nPikush had “ instructed to investigate the facts of disclosure of bank secrecy that led to \npublication of bank secrets related to transactions of bank customers in [the Nashi Groshi \narticles ]. Please clarify the procedure for our further communication for conducting the official \ninvestigation ” {E7/307.4/2}; and on 13.2.15, Sokolovskiy responded to Mr \nLuchaninov’s email explaining that he had investigated the number of times that \nparticular employees retrieved information about the companies mentioned in \nthe Nashi Groshi articles. He identified two “ employees of interest ”: a teller and one \nof the Deputy Heads within BOK {E7/310/1-2}. \n(ii) (If they remained in post) anyone investigating D1-2 would have been fobbed off \n614 The Bank can go further still. Suppose that, contrary to all of the above, someone within the \nBank did start to investigate D1-2 and was not immediately dismissed (or worse). What \nwould have happened then? They would have been rebuffed or fobbed off. \n615 There was, of course, no such investigation within the Bank. But this is exactly what \nhappened when the GPO and NBU started to investigate: \n(1) As described above, the Bank’s response to receipt of a ruling from a GPO senior \ninvestigator was to issue a letter of refusal. \n(2) As for the NBU, the Bank took a different tack.

But this is exactly what \nhappened when the GPO and NBU started to investigate: \n(1) As described above, the Bank’s response to receipt of a ruling from a GPO senior \ninvestigator was to issue a letter of refusal. \n(2) As for the NBU, the Bank took a different tack. See the following chronology: \nDate Event \n5.2.15 The Nashi Groshi articles are published. \n12.2.15  The NBU issues Request 27 {E7/309}. It requires a Bank official to provide a \nwritten statement explaining the “ quality of lending, purpose of lending, foreign trade \ncontracts, and collateral used for loan security ” in relation to the loans to the 42 \nAA2/15/324\n318 Date Event \nBorrowers identified in the Nashi Groshi articles (the “Nashi Groshi \nBorrowers” ).  \n19.2.15  Dubilet responds to Request 27, assuring the NBU that “ loan operations were \nperformed in full compliance with the requirements of the law ” {E8/8.1}, and providing \nfurther information in three annexes.  \nThe third of those annexes is important: it is a 26-page table giving details of \nsecurity purportedly granted in support of the lending to the Nashi Groshi \nBorrowers (comprising, inter alia , many Share Pledges and pledges over supply \nagreements): {E8/8.1.3}. In total 612 items of security are identified \n{E8/8.1.3/26}. \n24.3.15  The NBU commences an unscheduled on-site visit in connection with the \nlending to the Nashi Groshi Borrowers {E8/129.4}. Two information requests \nare issued by the inspectors, on 25.3.15 and 30.3.15: {E8/141.4} and \n{E8/143.1}. \n15.5.15  The NBU’s Nashi Groshi audit team report back {E9/214.1}. They conclude \nthat “[ n]o facts have been found of relationships of the non-resident legal entities, the owners \nof the Branch’s customers, with the insiders and the Bank’s related parties ” {E9/214.1/2}.  \n616 Ms Rozhkova put it well in evidence. When it was suggested that the NBU knew by reason \nof Request 27 that “ the supply contracts were shams ”, she responded: \n“I cannot agree with it, my Lord, because to clarify the situation, NBU requires some \nadditional documents and my further experience, when I work with the bank management, \ngive me -- I can suggest that the Bank provide a lot of explanations that all these contracts \nand borrowers is real and good.” {Day8/92:25} - {Day8/93:5} \n(iii) Even with full co-operation from within the Bank, an investigation would have taken far \nlonger than 44 days \n617 The Glavcom article was published at 6.30pm on 7.11.14 {E7/8} and the Claim Form was \nissued on 21.12.17 {A1/1/1}. So D1 must establish that, within 44 days of reading the \nallegations in the Glavcom article, an investigator would have acquired knowledge of facts \nsufficient to allow the Bank to allege each element of a tort claim. That is utterly unrealistic. \n618 First, the hypothetical investigator would have needed to gather and review the loan \ndocumentation for the loans to the 30 Borrowers identified in the Glavcom Article. If one \nincludes client questionnaires, financial statements, loan applications, minutes of meetings \napproving the borrowing and loan agreements etc., that amounts to a huge volume of \ndocumentation.565 That task would have been likely to take several weeks at a minimum. \n619 Secondly, the investigator would have needed to review not only the 20 2014 Ukrainian \nJudgments that had been published by 7.11.14 (see Appendix L1 ), but also ( i) the further \n \n565  See the Bank’s Statements of Facts. \n{AA2/23}\nAA2/15/325\n319 31 2014 Ukrainian Judgments which were published on 10.11.14, 11.11.14, 12.11.14, \n13.11.14, 17.11.14, 18.11.14, 19.11.14, 20.11.14, 27.11.14, 1.12.14, 4.12.14, 8.12.14, 9.12.14, \n15.12.14, 18.12.14 and 24.12.14 (the last of which  dates – on which three judgments were \npublished – was obviously after the 44-day period had expired) ( ibid.), and ( i"}

And then the \ninvestigator would have needed to obtain the loan documentation for the additional 20 \nBorrowers identified as a result.  \n620 Thirdly, the investigator would need to establish that D1-2 were indeed the true owners and \ncontrollers of all 50 of the Borrowers. That would have been a difficult task: \n(1) D1-2’s most recent IFRS shareholder representation letter (31.12.13) and NBU related \nparty list (1.10.14) both failed to identify (and, in some cases, denied) that any of the \nBorrowers were the Bank’s related parties: see {E2/257}, {K3-D/76P}. \n(2) As we explained above, the NBU concluded on 15.5.15, following an unscheduled \naudit, that the 42 Nashi Groshi Borrowers were not linked to D1-2 or other Bank \ninsiders. \n(3) In July 2015, the Bank only admitted that nine of the 50 Borrowers were related \nparties. In December 2015, the NBU had concluded that 21 of the 50 Borrowers were \nrelated (see D1’s Day 10 hand-up {AA6/8/1-3}). \n(4) The structures by which the Borrowers are owned are often fiendishly complex, and \nnobody implicated in the Misappropriation would have provided any information to \nhelp.566 To the contrary, the investigator would likely have been hampered by the \nownership structures being changed – as they were in 2015 – to hide connections with \nD1-2: see Section G .  \n(5) Even now, after six years of hard-fought litigation, D1-2 still deny ownership of the \nvast majority, and control of all, of the Borrowers.  \n621 Fourthly, the investigator would have had to consider the security position. As explained \nabove, when the NBU asked about security in relation to the Relevant Loans to the 42 Nashi \nGroshi Borrowers, it was provided with a 26-page list identifying 612 items of security \n{E8/8.1.3}. The investigator would (first) have had to gather each security agreement and \n(second) assess whether the security was valid and valuable or a sham containing vastly \n \n566  See, by way of analogy, D1-2’s refusal in these proceedings to admit the roles played for them by PBC and \nSunaltezza. \n{AA2/15/178}\nAA2/15/326\n320 inflated asset prices. In this regard, those responsible for the Misappropriation would no \ndoubt have referred (as D1 did in March 2018) to the fact that the Relevant Loans were \nsecured by “… shares in valuable companies with significant production and trading activities generating \ncashflows and holding real assets. … This security was examined and accepted by PwC over successive \naudits ”: see Lafferty2/¶86 {H2/8/19}. The same point is maintained, to this day, in D1’s \nDefence {A1/8/13} (¶18(2)). \n622 Fifthly, the investigator would have needed to investigate the manner in which the Relevant \nLoans were granted including the formal chains of command within the Bank (under the \nBank’s Charter, the Credit Committee Regulations, etc.) and the informal means by which \nD1-2 controlled the Bank without leaving their fingerprints on any documentation by which \nthe loans were approved. D1-2 deny to this day that they were responsible for procuring the \nRelevant Loans. Without some evidence that they did so, the investigator would have no \nbasis to allege that they acted unlawfully for the purposes of Art. 1166. \n623 Sixthly, the investigator would have had to grapple with the way in which Relevant Loans \nwere purportedly repaid by Intermediary Loans. The mere fact of such purported \nrepayments would have sent the inve"}

The mere fact of such purported \nrepayments would have sent the investigator down a further rabbit hole: he would have had \nto repeat step 1 above for Intermediary Loans. Indeed, the position would be a moving \ntarget: 19 Relevant Drawdowns were purportedly repaid by Intermediary Drawdowns \nbetween 7.11.14 and 21.12.14 and 52 were purportedly repaid between 21.12.14 and 8.12.15: \nsee {D1/511P}.567 The investigator would have had to work out what was being done here \nand its impact on his investigation. \n(d) Knowledge of members of the Management Board, ECC, Legal Department etc. \n(i) The Management Board \n624 For the reasons described above, no investigation by any Bank employee would have got \nbeyond first base. But there are additional points to make about the Management Board. \n625 First, and most importantly, a majority of the Management Board were complicit in the \nMisappropriation, such that their knowledge is not relevant for the purposes of limitation: \n(1) As of 14.11.14, the 16 members of the Management Board were {K1/4/10}: \n \n567  Relevant Drawdowns 29 (Elsis Time), 47 (Faboris), 54 (Foxar), 109 – 121 (Mastein), 147 (Ortika), 206 (Saltiz) \nand 264 (Viitella) were directly repaid by Intermediary Drawdowns between 7.11.14 and 21.12.14, irrespective \nof whether the Bank’s Methodology or the Alternative Methodology is employed. See Thompson4/App. 5-2-\n9-5 {D1/511P} (columns F, G and I). \nAA2/15/327\n321 (a) Chair: Dubilet. \n(b) General Deputy Chair: Pikush. \n(c) First Deputy Chairs: Yatsenko, Novikov and Gorokhovsky. \n(d) Deputy Chairs: Chmona, Dubilet Jnr, Gurieva, Kandaurov, Kryzhanovskiy, \nNehynskiyi, Shmalchenko, Vityaz and Zavorotnyi. \n(e) Chief Accountant: Korotina. \n(f) Head of Financial Monitoring: Teryokhin. \n(2) Of those individuals, the Bank alleges that at least Dubilet (who approved at least 131 \nRelevant Loans), Pikush (129), Yatsenko (129), Novikov (127), Gorokhovsky (129), \nChmona (126), Gurieva (129), Kandaurov (123), Kryzhanovskiy (127) and \nShmalchenko (3) were complicit in the Misappropriation.568  \n626 Secondly, and as for the others, it is inconceivable that Dubilet Jnr would have conducted \nan independent investigation into his father’s conduct. There is direct evidence that Korotina \nand Vityaz would have simply toed the party line: see above. And it is inconceivable that the \nremaining members would have initiated investigations in relation not only to D1-2, but the \nconduct of their superiors on the Management Board as well.  \n627 Thirdly, in circumstances where the fraudsters had a majority on the Management Board, \nthe remaining Management Board members did not have the requisite power to cause legal \nproceedings to be brought against D1-2, such that their knowledge is not attributable to the \nBank for the purposes of limitation anyway.569 \n(ii) The ECC \n628 The position here is even more clear-cut:  \n(1) The ECC had no general management responsibility or power to bring proceedings \nagainst D1-2.  \n(2) Members of the ECC were obviously complicit in the Misappropriation: they voted \nin favour of the loans with the characteristics described in Section E  above and which \n \n568  There is a suggestion at D1 Opening/¶280(2) {AA3/1/95} that the Court is somehow prevented from finding \nthat these individuals’ knowledge is not to be attributed to the Bank for limitation purposes on the basis that \nthey were complicit in the fraud because the Bank has not included them as Defendants to these proceedings. \nNo principle of (English or Ukrainian) law is cited in support of this n"}

At equal votes, the vote of the Chairman of the [Management ] Board \nis decisive ”. \n{AA2/15/122}\nAA2/15/328\n322 were, to borrow D2’s turn of phrase, “ clandestine and contrary to all principles of prudent \nbanking ”. The more junior members of the ECC were no doubt following instructions, \nand so have a lower level of culpability than their Management Board counterparts; \nbut the notion that they should have been investigating themselves is absurd.  \n629 D1 has focused on a member of the ECC called Gennady Linsky.570 He argues that Linsky \nremained with the Bank until 2022, such that the Bank cannot have regard him as complicit \nin the fraud. This submission overlooks Ms Pakhachuk’s evidence that “[ w]e could not replace \nabout 20,000 of staff. We remained working with the existing staff but we tried to engage new people just to \nbe able to manage this huge institution. We couldn’t spend all our time just for replacement of the staff, so \nwe took it in stages and we tried to hire staff as fast as we could and, yes, we used our old resources ” \n{Day13/14:19-25}. And it is obvious that Linsky was a man who, whilst D1-2 remained at \nthe Bank, would toe the party line: \n(1) He voted in favour of 128 (commercially inexplicable) Relevant Loans.  \n(2) On 4.11.14, Dubilet emailed Linsky, forwarding a series of pre-publication queries \nfrom Glavcom, and asked him to help prepare “ information on the outflow of deposits that \nwere compensated by the NBU loans . Please prepare the figures for outflows and refinancing volumes. \nHow it was used, including in terms of the reduction in the loan portfolio ” {E6/324}. \n(3) On 13.11.14, Linsky received an email (sent to him on Pikush’s instructions) regarding \nthe Bank’s response to a series of queries from its auditors, KPMG, following the \npublication of the Glavcom Article. Linsky forwarded the email to Dudko, stating \n“read it, don’t forward it to anyone, we’ll talk ” {E7/28.1}. \n(4) The following day, 14.11.14, Linsky emailed Pikush setting out a list of “ people in the \nBank who have access to this information ” (i.e. the information used in the Glavcom Article) \n{E7/36.01}.  \n(5) Later, Linsky was involved in the Bank’s response to the publication of the Nashi \nGroshi articles and the NBU’s resulting unscheduled inspection. Mr Luchaninov’s \nunchallenged evidence identified Linsky as one of the attendees at the March 2015 \nmeeting at which he was instructed to determine whether there were any connections \nbetween the 42 Borrowers and D1-2 and to provide guidance on how any such \nconnections could be removed: Luchaninov/¶¶52-54 {B1/3/13}.  \n \n570  See D1 Opening/¶280(4) {AA3/1/96-97} and {Day6/109:20-22}. \nAA2/15/329\n323 (6) Linsky remained involved in related party issues; for example, on 23.6.15, Linsky was \ncopied into an email regarding how to “ defend ” 40 companies identified by EY as being \npart of a “ connectivity scheme ” on the basis of ownership of their shares {E10/122}. \n(iii) The legal department  \n630 This point is more hopeless still: it was not pleaded or mentioned in written openings; \ninstead, it emerged for the first time in oral opening on Day 6 and took on a life of its own \nduring XX of the Bank’s witnesses.571 Whilst not entirely clear, D1-2 apparently intend"}

She was BOK’s most senior lawyer, \nand was directly involved in the Bank’s response to the GPO investigation {E8/49}. \nThe Bank cannot be criticised for failing to tender legal department employees as factual \nwitnesses, and the criticism made by D1’s counsel during oral opening572 smacks of a last-\nditch attempt to salvage a doomed limitation defence. \n \n571  With various questions asked as to the role and functions of personnel within the Bank’s legal department \n(Bagrova, Knyazeva, Levadsky, Matuzka, Mazur, Nakorchevsky, Shnurko, Sizova, Smirnova, Stelchenko and \nStupak) – see, for example {Day11/6:} - {Day11/14:} (D1) and {Day13/5:12-22} (D2). \n572  See {Day6/98:12-14}. \nAA2/15/330\n324 (e) Claims against D3-8 \n632 Given that D3-8 are vehicles of D1-2, the points set out above apply equally to the Bank’s \nclaims in tort against them.573 \n(f) Burden of proof \n633 The burden lies on Ds to prove that the Bank possessed actual knowledge of the facts giving \nrise to the claim and/or could not have obtained such knowledge by a date more than three \nyears before the claim was filed on 21.12.17. Ds have not come anywhere close to doing so.  \n(5) D2’s limited constructive knowledge case  \n634 D2 is the only defendant to have pleaded a constructive knowledge case, claiming that the \nRelevant Loans themselves provided a basis to assert that relevant persons at the Bank \nshould have known all the facts relevant to enable a fraud claim under Art. 1166 to be \nbrought. That is hopeless and can be given short shrift. \n635 First, it wholly ignores the attribution issue. It is only if individuals at the Bank who could \nhave sanctioned the commencement of a claim should have known about the relevant facts \nthat the Bank can be said to have the opportunity to bring the claim. But on the facts of this \ncase, those individuals (D1-2) were the parties perpetrating the fraud (and the same is true \nif one includes Dubilet and/or the Management Board). \n636 Secondly, it is in any event unreal. The reality in this case is that even if it were correct that \na hypothetically diligent and non-implicated person would have concerns about the terms \nof the Relevant Loans or the status of the Borrowers ( i) that does not lead one to identify a \nUS$2 billion fraud committed by the owners through a network of shell companies; and ( ii) \ngiven that D1-2 and their associates controlled every level of management which would have \nbeen needed to investigate that, one cannot conclude that reasonable dili"}

The “ facts on which  [the Bank’s ] cause of action depends ” \ninclude that the Relevant Loans and RSAs were void and/or entered into abusively, such that D3-8 received \nthe Unreturned Prepayments without sufficient legal basis; the Bank’s actual knowledge of such facts (as noted \nabove, D3-8 only plead a case of actual knowledge) is subject to the same analysis as set out above. \nAA2/15/331\n325 abuse of rights. But, for the sake of completeness, we explain below why this is a paradigm \ncase for the exercise of discretion.  \n(a) Reasons why the limitation period should be disapplied and/or the limitation \ndefence disallowed on the basis of abuse of rights \n638 A chronology of post-nationalisation events is found at Appendix L2 . For now, we \nsummarise the key tasks undertaken by the Bank’s new management in their first year: \n(1) Stabilising the Bank . Initially, the Bank’s new management had to firefight: ( i) they \ntook over a systemic bank (20,000+ staff, 20 million+ customers {Day13/14:19}) in \na state of disarray; ( ii) the Bank had “ enormous cash flow problem ”, with liabilities of \nUS$6bn, available cash of US$70m, and customers regularly withdrawing deposits \n(Pakhachuk/¶14 {B1/1/5}); ( iii) there was the real possibility of civil unrest if \nordinary Ukrainians became unable to access their deposits ( ibid.); and  ( iv) the new \nSupervisory Board was given a long shopping list of priority tasks by the NBU on \n6.1.17 {E17/112}, with a 293-page audit report detailing the extent of the Bank’s \ndysfunctionality following on 30.1.17 {E17/138}. Ms Pakhachuk’s evidence was that \n“[a]ll of us on the Management Board were at our absolute limit. Our typical hours for January and \nFebruary were from 8am to 10pm every day of the week (i.e. including weekends) ” {B1/1/6} (¶15) \nand that “[ o]ur task within the first three months after nationalisation was to ... stabilise the \nsituation and keep servicing the customers ” {Day12/35:14-17}. \n(2) Dealing with poison pills . The new management had to create an organisational \nstructure “ almost from scratch ” (Pakhachuk/¶15 {B1/1/6}), a task made more difficult \nbecause the most senior pre-nationalisation executives – Dubilet, Gurieva, Novikov \netc. – had walked out without any transfer of their work ( ibid.). Other problems \nincluded ( i) the Bank’s staff’s enduring loyalty to D1-2: Pakhachuk/¶18 {B1/1/6}; ( ii) \nmissing hard and soft copy documentation ( e.g. the Investment Business was “ ... \nstripped of everything: the filing cabinets were completely empty and even the plug sockets had been \nremoved from the wall ”: Pakhachuk/¶21 {B1/1/7}); and ( iii) the need to deal with \nlitigation brought against the Bank as a result of the bail-in procedure for related \nparties with deposits at the Bank: Pakhachuk/¶33 {B1/1/9}.  \n(3) Establishing a related-party loans unit .

{"start": 913500, "text": "1-2: Pakhachuk/¶18 {B1/1/6}; ( ii) \nmissing hard and soft copy documentation ( e.g. the Investment Business was “ ... \nstripped of everything: the filing cabinets were completely empty and even the plug sockets had been \nremoved from the wall ”: Pakhachuk/¶21 {B1/1/7}); and ( iii) the need to deal with \nlitigation brought against the Bank as a result of the bail-in procedure for related \nparties with deposits at the Bank: Pakhachuk/¶33 {B1/1/9}.  \n(3) Establishing a related-party loans unit . Notwithstanding these difficulties, the first \nmeeting of the new Supervisory Board – held on 17.1.17 – established a new unit, \nunder Sergiy Stratonov, to oversee all issues concerning the Bank’s related-party loans. \nStratonov reported back on 6.3.17, to say that: ( i) his department started work in \n{AA2/23/3}\nAA2/15/332\n326 February, hiring five lawyers; ( ii) there were 230 credit cases under his department’s \nmandate; ( iii) inspections of collateral “ will be performed by 300 persons ” , to be completed \nby 31.3.17;574 (iv) decisions on revaluation of collateral would be made by 30.4.17; and \n(v) a separate archive of credit documents would be created by 30.4.17: see {B3/1/39} \nand {E17/143/7}.  \n(4) Audit/capitalisation . The Bank’s new management appointed EY as new auditors \non 17.1.17 {AA1/4/27-28}, and thereafter dealt with a very difficult process for the \naudit of the Bank’s first set of post-nationalisation accounts: see, e.g., {E17/149}, \n{E17/149.1}, {E17/152.2}, {E17/154/2}, {K1/6/3-9}. In addition, EY conducted \nextensive investigations into the Bank’s capital needs, culminating in a 128-page report \nproduced on 19.3.17, updated on 3.4.17, and considered by the Supervisory Board on \n26.4.17: {E17/148} {E17/151} {E17/154}. It explains that the Bank’s credit risk (on \na conservative scenario) was UAH 222.3bn {E17/148/9}. As Pakhachuk comments, \n“I can remember being very struck by EY’s report: it was the point at which I began to think that \nthings at the Bank really could be worse than we even imagined ” {B1/1/11} ( ¶41). \n(5) The Rothschild negotiations . In their Nationalisation Letter, D1-2 had promised to \nrestructure and provide collateral for the Bank’s corporate loan portfolio by 1.7.17 \n{E17/40}. It was entirely appropriate for the Bank’s management to seek to hold D1-\n2 to that promise, not least because a negotiated resolution would (as the Ukrainian \ngovernment and IMF had pointed out) have “ minimise [d] expenses of the state ” \n{E17/155.3.2}. In the lead-up to that deadline, a consortium led by Rothschild was \nappointed to conduct negotiations with D1-2 {E17/152/4}. Negotiations continued \nbeyond 1.7.17, with Shlapak (then Chair of the Management Board) writing to the \nUkrainian Minister of Finance on 18.7.17 to say that Rothschild had had four meetings \nwith the “ Former UBOs ” and that Rothschild would report back to the Supervisory \nBoard on 20.7.17 {E17/160}. On 27.7.17, Matuzka, then head of the Bank’s legal \ndepartment, reported to the Management Board that it was unlikely that the \nRothschild negotiations would result in an agreement between the Bank and D1-2 \n{AA1/4/29}. \n(6) Assessing related party lending and the New Loans . Meanwhile, the Bank’s \naccounts produced on 25.5.17 wrote down the New Loans by 98% and – as Ms \n \n574  Examples of those inspections, undertaken in relation to the OSFs between 10.3.17 to 28.3.17, are given at \n{AA2/11}. \nAA2/15/333\n327 Pakhachuk explained – “ by May we realised that those were mocked borrowers ” \n{Day12/76:21-23}. Investigations continued, with a critical meeting taking place on \n20.7.17; it was then that Shlapak reported to the Supervisory Board on the problems \nfaced by the Bank {E17/162/8}. His accompanying 126-page presentation entitled \n“Problem assets of PrivatBank ” {E17/100} contained ( inter alia ): \n(a) A slide entitled ‘Degradation of servicing’  {E17/100/5}: this shows the total \namount owed pursuant to loans to 229 related parties, approximately "}

Investigations continued, with a critical meeting taking place on \n20.7.17; it was then that Shlapak reported to the Supervisory Board on the problems \nfaced by the Bank {E17/162/8}. His accompanying 126-page presentation entitled \n“Problem assets of PrivatBank ” {E17/100} contained ( inter alia ): \n(a) A slide entitled ‘Degradation of servicing’  {E17/100/5}: this shows the total \namount owed pursuant to loans to 229 related parties, approximately two-thirds \nof which by value were the New Loans (see also {E17/100/3}); and that in \nJanuary 2017 UAH 556m in interest was paid in relation to those loans, but that \nby June 2017 interest payments had declined to UAH 207m.  \n(b) A slide entitled ‘Total portfolio of loans … of related party borrowers’ : this \nexplains that UAH 17.133m of interest had been paid in relation to the New \nLoans in June 2017 (which, applying the USD exchange rate given in the slide, \nequates to US$656,703) {E17/100/28}. This is to be compared with \nStratonov’s March 2017 report, which explains that UAH 698.98m of interest \nwas paid in respect of the New Loans in January - February 2017 {E17/143/3}. \n(7) Instructing Hogan Lovells . On 27.7.17, Ms Pakhachuk (the new Acting Chair of \nthe Management Board) chaired her first meeting. The board resolved to instruct \nHogan Lovells to investigate potential claims against D1-2: see Pakhachuk/¶¶48-49 \n{B1/1/12-13} and {E17/164/2}. A week later, on 3.8.17, the Supervisory Board \nauthorised Ms Pakhachuk formally to instruct Hogan Lovells: {E17/166}.  \n(8) Working up the claim . As a result of concerns that information might be leaked to \nD1-2 (concerns that turned out to be entirely justified), Hogan Lovells was instructed \nto develop the claims without the Bank’s involvement. Instead, and aside from \nassisting with the provision of documentation ( e.g. {E17/181}), “ … At the end of that \nprocess, i.e. when the claims were almost prepared, Hogan Lovells would report to the Supervisory \nBoard and receive authorisation to begin the proceedings ” (Pakhachuk/¶¶55-56 {B1/1/14}). \nGiven the complexity of these proceedings, and the seriousness of the allegations \nbeing made by the Bank, it could not sensibly be argued that the period of c. four \nmonths to work up the claim and the (without notice) applications for service out and \nfor a WFO was unreasonable. This is not least because Hogan Lovells had to stay \nabreast of D1-2’s 2017 Spoiling Tactics (see above).  \nAA2/15/334\n328 (9) The WFO application . On 15.12.17, papers for the Bank’s WFO and service out \napplications were lodged with the Court. They included ( i) a 116-page affidavit \n{H1/1} (together with 1,074-page hard copy exhibit and a 15,508-page electronic \nexhibit), ( ii) a 64-page expert report on Ukrainian law {D1/27}, ( iii) a 58-page skeleton \nargument {G2/1}, ( iv) draft Particulars of Claim, and ( v) a draft freezing and service \nout orders. The claim form was issued on 21.12.17, immediately after service of the \nWFO the previous evening. \n639 In summary, the Bank’s new management: ( i) inherited a nearly impossible situation from \nD1-2; ( ii) appreciated the significance of purported related party lending almost immediately \nand put in place a unit to investigate the same; ( iii) behaved entirely reasonably in seeking to \nexplore whether D1-2 would make good on the promise to the Ukrainian Prime Minister \nmade in the Nationalisation Letter, ( iv) kept an eye on what interest payments were being \nmade under the New Loans and took decisive action following the events in May – July 2017 \ndescribed above, and ( v) thereafter promptly instructed Hogan Lovells to investigate \npotential claims available to the Bank.  \n640 This is, therefore, a textbook case for the exercise of the court’s discretion, bearing in mind \nthe Supreme Court’s instructions to have “ due regard to all the circumstances of the case ” and apply \nlimitation rules “ with some flexibility and w"}

Furthermore, during this period both D1-2 offered repeated \nassurances575 to the NBU and the Ukrainian government that they would ensure that \nthe Bank’s fraudulent loans would be repaid, and proper security put in place.  \n(2) D1-2’s unreasonable behaviour and influence continued after nationalisation, as \nmanifested in the fact that they ( i) regularly obtained the Bank’s confidential and \nprivileged information from employees who remained loyal to them, ( ii) failed to \nhonour the promise made to the Ukrainian Prime Minister in the Nationalisation \nLetter; and ( iii) instituted the 2017 Spoiling Tactics.  \n \n575  February 2016 {E12/256/1}; 10.7.16 {E14/322/1}; October 2016 {B3/4/34} {B3/4/32}; December 2016 \n{E17/40}. \nAA2/15/335\n329 (3) The Bank’s new management acted reasonably and with expedition in bringing the \nclaim, in the face not only of immense competing pressures, but also significant \npractical difficulties in investigating the facts giving rise to the claim.  \n(4) A disapplication of the limitation period would have no adverse effect on the evidence \nadduced by any party.  \n(5) For Ds to rely upon a limitation defence in circumstances where their own fraudulent \nconduct is not only the subject-matter of the claim, but also the cause of any failure \non the part of the Bank to bring proceedings within the default three-year limitation \nperiod, is an abuse of rights; that either provides independent grounds for \ndisapplication of the limitation period, or is further reason why the Court should \nexercise its discretion under Art. 267(5) CC in the Bank’s favour.  \n(b) Points taken by the Defendants \n641 None of Ds advances a pleaded case in relation to the disapplication of the limitation period.  \n642 In D1’s written opening , however, D1 submitted that no disapplication should be granted \nbecause ( i) “D1 and D2 deny being in such absolute control of the Bank ”; and ( ii) “[t]he NBU was in \na position to cause the Bank to make enquiries and if necessary take action against D1 and D2 but chose \nnot to do so ”.576  \n643 As to the first of those points, the Bank relies on the matters set out in Section D  above to \ndemonstrate that D1-2’s control of the Bank was absolute, and on the matters raised above \nto demonstrate that they would never have permitted the Bank to bring claims against them \nprior to nationalisation. \n644 As to the second point, there is simply no evidence demonstrating that the NBU could have \nprocured the Bank to bring proceedings against D1-2 prior to nationalisation, nor do any of \nthe experts suggest that the actions (or inactions) of a regulator have any role to play in \nassessing Art. 267(5) CC. \n645 D1’s case now appears to be that the NBU  is culpable for not having intervened to \nnationalise the Bank much earlier than it did.577 This represents yet another eleventh-hour \nU-turn  on the part of D1, who has spent the entirety of these proceedings arguing that the \nnationalisation was unjustified, being the result of a “ politically motivated campaign ” waged \n \n576  D1 Opening/¶286(1)-(2) {AA3/1/98-99}. \n577  See D1 Opening/¶289: “ Although the NBU did eventually d"}

Whether the NBU, under the close watch of the \nIMF, was right to wait to nationalise the Bank until it got to the stage where it “ posed a serious \nthreat to the financial stability of Ukraine ”579 is not a matter on which this Court can or should \nsit in judgment. Nor, as we have said, is the approach taken by the Bank’s regulator a relevant \nfactor when determining whether the Bank was prevented or significantly hindered from \nbringing the action in time.580 \n647 In D1’s oral opening , he submitted that even had the Bank been significantly hindered in \nthe two years prior to nationalisation, if it cannot demonstrate that it was so hindered for \nthe entire time between nationalisation and 21.12.17, then the limitation period should not \nbe disapplied.581 But that argument fundamentally ( i) ignores what the Bank’s new \nmanagement were actually doing in 2017, and ( ii) misunderstands the position as a matter of \nUkrainian law, which does not slice-and-dice the limitation period in the manner for which \nD1 contends: see Sirius-Bud above. The logical consequence of D1’s position would be that \nthe time within which the Bank could bring its claim would be reduced from three years to \nless than a year. That, the Bank says, would be a plainly unfair result, and would not be at all \nconsistent with Ukrainian law, as articulated by the Supreme Court, which makes clear that \nreal access to justice is of paramount importance.582 \n648 D2’s position  is that “[ a] mere election by the Bank not to pursue proceedings cannot be treated as an \nobjective reason beyond its control that prevented or significantly hindered it from bringing its claim ”.583 For \nthe reasons explained above, this is not a case where the Bank simply elected not to bring \nits claim prior to nationalisation. On the contrary, it is a case where the only people with the \n \n578  See, for example, Rozhkova1/¶¶214 and 222 {B1/5/53} and {B1/5/55} and Rozhkova2/¶64 {B1/18/18}. \n579  Rozhkova1/¶269 {B1/5/64}. \n580  D1 has accepted that the knowledge of the NBU is not attributable to the Bank for limitation purposes \n{Day6/128:7-9}, such that, at most, the knowledge of the NBU can only be relevant if the court needs to \nconsider whether to disapply the limitation period under Art. 267(5). There was some attempt during Ms \nRozhkova’s XX to establish that the NBU was preparing to bring claims against D1-2 from early 2016 \n{Day8/104:21} ff, but Ms Rozhkova made clear that bringing claims on behalf of the Bank was (unsurprisingly) \nnot the responsibility of its regulator {Day8/107:20-21}. \n581  {Day6/86:7-13} and {Day6/118:1-7}. \n582  See, for example, SFG Hermes at ¶5.83 {C9.7/11/19}. \n583  D2 Opening/¶314.1 {AA4/1/125}. \nAA2/15/337\n331 power to institute proceedings were D1-2 themselves or (if the Bank is wrong on its Charter \nargument) a Management Board stacked with people loyal to them. \n649 D3-8  do not advance a positive case on disapplication of the limitation peri"}

Such an approach is entirely consistent with \nUkrainian law, as set out in Sirius Bud and discussed above (and the analogous approach \napplied under s. 33 of the English Limitation Act 1980). \n(7) English public policy \n652 Finally, the Bank’s position is that if Ukrainian law works in such a way that the limitation \nperiod started to run two years prior to nationalisation, even though fraudsters remained in \ncontrol of the Bank, that would be “ manifestly incompatible with [English ] public policy ” for the \npurposes of Art. 26 of Rome II {M1/3/8}.587 That point was not addressed by D1 in his \nwritten or oral opening. It was addressed by D2 and D3-8, but both appeared to focus on \nthe question of whether a three-year limitation period is unjust per se,588 with D3-8 focussing \non whether a three-year limitation period would cause “ undue hardship ” to the Bank. But the \nBank does not say that a three-year limitation period is itself incompatible with English \npublic policy, or that, without more, a limitation period of this length it would cause undue \nhardship. Rather, the Bank’s position is that allowing time to run during the period when \nthe Bank was under the control of D1-2 is manifestly incompatible with English public \npolicy, in that the Bank stood no realistic prospect of bringing claims against D1-2 or their \n \n584  D3-8 Opening/¶158 {AA5/1/67}. \n585  See e.g. {Day11/91:15} ff. \n586  See D1-2’s skeleton arguments for the WFO set-aside hearing: “ D1 … does not seek to establish that there was no \nevidence of a risk of dissipation ” {G2/22/12} (¶12); “[ D2] adopts the submissions made on behalf of [D1]” {G2/23/3} \n(¶6).  \n587  See Bank Opening/¶515 {AA2/1/203}, and the authorities cited at fn. 458 {AA2/1/203-204}. \n588  D2 Opening/¶314.3-314.4 {AA4/1/126}; D3-8 Opening/¶169 {AA5/1/69}. \nAA2/15/338\n332 vehicles throughout this period, such that (if the limitation period is applied) it will in practice \nbe deprived of any right to vindicate its claim. \n(8) Amendments to the POC \n653 In September 2020, the Bank was given permission to amend its POC, in particular to \nexpand its definitions of “ Relevant Loans ” and “ Borrowers ” to include loans made to \nProminmet and the three Cypriot Borrowers.

As no Defendant has as yet responded, the Bank repeats what it said in \nopening and will respond further as appropriate in oral closings. \n(9) Conclusion \n654 Quite aside from their abject lack of legal merit, Ds’ limitation arguments leave a bitter taste \nin the mouth. The Bank makes three concluding points: \n(1) D1 spent years defending every aspect of this claim root and branch, promising at the \nreturn date hearing to explain at trial “ what was going on and why this was being done and so \non”, maintaining that there was proper security, and denying control over all of D3-8 \nand the Borrowers. D2 joins D1 in much of this and posits an “ alternative analysis ” to \nthat put forward by the Bank, essentially to the effect that Bank officers and employees \n– led by Dubilet – were engaged in a wrongful loan recycling operation. But both say, \nin a limitation context, that the Misappropriation was so obvious that an investigator \nshould have gleaned enough to plead a case within 44 days of the Glavcom Article. \nThis submission ignores the obvious realities that nobody within the Bank would ever \nhave investigated D1-2; that they would have been sacked or rebuffed or fobbed off \nif they tried (just like the Bank fobbed off and rebuffed the far more powerful NBU \nand GPO); that an investigation would, leaving these points aside, have taken many, \nmany months; and that neither the Supervisory Board (D1-2) or Management Board \n(their cronies) would ever have authorised the institution of proceedings against them. \n(2) D1-2 also say that those public servants who, post-nationalisation, worked night and \nday to clean up the mess that D1-2 created within the Bank should not have spent all \nof that time seeking to hold together a systemic financial institution for millions of \nUkrainians (and indeed to prevent civil unrest), should not have given D1-2 a chance \nto make good their promises in the Nationalisation Letter, and should not have sought \na WFO against them (notwithstanding that this was obviously necessary). No, they \nshould instead have brought proceedings against them far more quickly in 2017, \ndespite (amongst many other things) the outrageous 2017 Spoiling Tactics deployed \nAA2/15/339\n333 by D1-2. Those public servants have come through regrettably hostile XX with flying \ncolours. They acted reasonably and with expedition. They deserve to be commended \nfor their actions and their bravery. \n(3) D1-2 also now say that the NBU was wrong to allow them to retain their ownership \nas long as it did, and should instead have nationalised the Bank much earlier, so that \nproceedings could be brought against them. Having spent so much time arguing that \nthe nationalisation was wrongful and part of a politically motivated conspiracy, it does \nnot lie in their mouth to make that argument now. \n655 Stepping back, the conduct of D1-2 in perpetrating the fraud, seeking to conceal it and then \nseeking to rely on a limitation defence to avoid paying compensation to the Bank (and, by \nextension, to the Ukrainian State and its public) was and is abusive in the extreme. Such \nconduct should not be rewarded. \nL2 ALLEGED INCONSISTENT CONDUCT  \n656 D1 Opening/¶¶197-215 {AA3/1/67} sets out D1’s case that the Bank’s claim in tort cannot \nsucceed because the Bank’s conduct in Ukraine has been inconsistent with its claim in these \nproceedings.589 D1’s case is bad in Ukrainian law and hopeless on the facts: the Bank has at \nall times acted in good faith590 and there is no evidence of reasonable and detrimental reliance \nby any relevant party. \n657 In this section, we address:  \n(1) The Ukrainian law principle of venire contra factum proprium  (“VCFP” ). \n(2) Other Ukrainian law preclusion rules. \n(3) The alleged English law rule against appropriation and reprobation"}

D3-8 \nadopt the same position: D3-8 Opening/¶72 {AA5/1/35}. \n590  The experts agree the VCFP principle “ derives from the principles of good faith and reasonableness ”: UkrJR/¶20.1 \n{C5/1/12}, Alyoshin XX {Day32/26:18} - {Day32/29:4}. \nAA2/15/340\n334 (1) The VCFP principle: Ukrainian law \n(a) Does the VCFP principle apply to void transactions?  \n658 Mr Beketov’s view is that the VCFP principle does not apply if the transaction in question \nis void. In other words, the Court must apply the consequence of a transaction being void \neven if the party seeking those consequences has acted inconsistently and the counter-party \nrelied on that conduct to his detriment: Beketov9/¶109 {C6/1/41}. Mr Beketov’s view was \nnot challenged in XX and is to be preferred:  \n(1) As set out in Section I , if a transaction is void, it is void by operation of law and the \nCourt does not have a discretion to refuse to confirm that the transaction is void. It \nwould make no sense if the Court’s discretionary power to apply the VCFP principle \ncould be deployed to treat a void contract as valid.  \n(2) Neither expert has found Ukrainian court practice in which a void transaction has \nbeen given effect upon the application of the VCFP principle. Mr Alyoshin seeks to \nsuggest that certain of the cases he cites involved void transactions ( e.g. the \nChornomornaftogaz (No 1) case): see Alyoshin3/¶¶67-68 {C9.1/1/31}). But those \ncases involve voidable transactions: see Beketov11/¶138(f), fn. 82 {C9.2/1/56}.  \n(3) D1 contends that “ the principles of reasonableness and good faith ” on which the VCFP \nprinciple is based should operate to preclude a person from asserting that a contract \nis void: D1 Opening/¶203 {AA3/1/69}. But that is to put the cart before the horse. \nIf the contract is void, it is void ab initio  by operation of law. The principle of \nreasonableness and good faith cannot be applied to create all the vestiges of a \ntransaction which has never existed.  \n(b) Reasonable and detrimental reliance \n659 Mr Beketov’s view that reasonable, detrimental reliance is required was not challenged in \nXX: Beketov11/¶¶136 ff {C9.2/1/52}. Until a few weeks before trial, that was agreed by Mr \nAlyoshin. But Mr Alyoshin has now reversed his position on this point in a manner \ntransparently intended to assist D1’s case. The timeline here is instructive:  \n(1) On 23.11.21 , Mr Alyoshin filed his first report in which he explained the VCFP \nprinciple. He quoted a number of Supreme Court rulings in which the VCFP principle \nwas explained on the basis that it required the party invoking it to show that he had \n{AA2/15/222}\nAA2/15/341\n335 relied to his detriment on the other party’s inconsistent conduct: Alyoshin1/¶¶124.1-\n124.4 {C2/1/44} quoting Person 2 v Satori-S,591 Lapaivka,592 and Fakel.593 \n(2) On 11.2.22 , the Joint Report was filed, in which Mr Alyoshin agreed that the VCFP \nprinciple applied if the party invoking it “ has acted on the belief ”. Whilst the wording of \nthe Joint Report does not refer expressly to “ detrimental ” reliance, given Mr Alyoshin’s \nevidence at that stage (cited above), the phrase “ has acted on such a belief ” ¶20.2 \n{C5/1/12} was plainly intended to include the concept of detriment.  \n(3) In May 2022 , D1 amended his Defence "}

Whilst the wording of \nthe Joint Report does not refer expressly to “ detrimental ” reliance, given Mr Alyoshin’s \nevidence at that stage (cited above), the phrase “ has acted on such a belief ” ¶20.2 \n{C5/1/12} was plainly intended to include the concept of detriment.  \n(3) In May 2022 , D1 amended his Defence to plead “ Ukrainian Courts may refuse to declare \nthat a contract is invalid even where there are grounds for doing so, if the party seeking such a \ndeclaration is acting in bad faith or abusing its rights (including where it has led the other party to \nreasonably believe that the transaction is valid, and the other party has acted on such a belief to its \ndetriment, such that the principle venire contra factum proprium applies) ”: D1Def/¶70(3B), \nbrown text {A1/8/41}. That was a straightforward recognition that detrimental \nreliance was a necessary ingredient of the VCFP principle. \n(4) On 25.10.22 , Mr Alyoshin filed his second report, in which he again quoted the \nSupreme Court’s finding in Person 2 v Satori-S594 at {C2/35/5} that the VCFP \nprinciple applies where “ the other party reasonably relies on [the other party’s conduct ] by acting \nto its own detriment ”: Alyoshin2/¶222 {C7/1/75}. \n(5) In March 2023 , D1 applied to re-re-re-re-re-re-amend his Defence and filed \nAlyoshin3 in support. The amendments changed D1’s plea of Ukrainian law at \nD1Def/¶70(3B) to remove the need to show detrimental reliance as an ingredient of \nthe VCFP principle. That amendment was made in an attempt to support D1’s case \nthat the Bank is precluded from alleging that the Relevant, Intermediary or New Loans \nare void or voidable on the basis that it has treated them as valid (see D1Def/¶88(1)(b) \n{A1/8/53}). If there was no longer a requirement to show detrimental reliance, all \nD1 would need to show is that the Bank had acted inconsistently in bad faith. \n \n591  Person 2 v Satori-S, decision of the Supreme Court dated 10.4.19 in Case No. 390/34/17:  “…Conduct contrary \nto good faith and fair business practice includes conduct inconsistent with prior representations or conduct of a party, provided that \nthe other party reasonably relies on them to its own detriment ” {C2/35/5}. \n592  Lapaivka, decision of the Supreme Court dated 7.10.20 in Case No. 450/2286/16-c: “ …behaviour that is \ninconsistent with previous statements or actions of a party, provided that the other party that acts to its own detriment reasonably \nrelies on them ” {C2/36/14}.  \n593  “ Conduct that is contrary to good faith and fair business practice is, in particular, conduct that does not comply with previous \nstatements or conduct of a party, provided that the other party reasonably relies on them ” {C2/33/11}.  \n594  Person 2 v Satori-S, decision of the Supreme Court dated 10.4.19 in Case No. 390/34/17 {C2/35}. \nAA2/15/342\n336 (6) In Alyoshin3, Mr Alyoshin obediently rowed back on his previous evidence: “ there is \nno universal requirement to prove that the party invoking the venire principle relied on the other party’s \ninconsistent statements or conduct ” (Alyoshin3/¶46 {C9.1/1/25}) and it would be open to \nthe Court to conclude that “ the Bank is precluded from alleging that the Relevant Loans, the \nIntermediary Loans or the New Loans are void even in the absence of the First Defendant’s actual \nreliance on the Bank’s prior statements or conduct, provided that a Ukrainian court was satisfied \nthat by making that allegation, the Bank was acting inconsistently and, in the circumstances, it would \nbe unfair or unconscionable to do so ” (Alyoshin3/¶69 {C9.1/1/32}).  \n(7) In XX, Mr Alyoshin could not decide what his position was.

In addition to those he cites \nin his first report (quoted above), the cases he relies on in his third report also show \n(unsurprisingly) that detrimental reliance is a requirement of the VCFP principle.595 All of \nthe cases restate the VCFP principle in substantially the same terms:  \n(1) Alyoshin3/¶56 – the Two Land Plots case:596 “The doctrine of venire contra factum proprium \nis based on the principle of good faith. For example, Article I.-1:103 of the principles, definitions \nand model rules of European private law states that conduct contrary to good faith and fair business \npractice is, inter alia, conduct inconsistent with a party’s previous statements or conduct, provided that \nthe other party acting to its own detriment reasonably relies on them ” {C9.1/27/20}. \n \n595  A point Mr Alyoshin refused to accept in XX: “ Q. all of these cases do refer expressly to the requirement for detrimental \nreliance, do you accept that? A. Yes - - no, I don’t remember, but maybe ” {Day32/44:5-7}.  \n596  Two Land Plots, decision of the Supreme Court dated 14.12.22 in Case No. 126/2200/20. \nAA2/15/343\n337 (2) Alyoshin3/¶¶61-66 – PrivatBank v Hot Tours Agencies:597 “The abovementioned principle \nof Roman law, ‘venire contra factum proprium’ is an expression of ‘equitable estoppel’ – one of the \nmost important doctrines of common law. In the common law system, this doctrine is based on the \n‘principles of fraud’ and is aimed at preventing a situation where one party can take an inconsistent \nposition during legal proceedings that differs from its previous conduct or statements if this places the \nopposing party at a disadvantage. A conduct contrary to good faith and fair dealing is, in particular, \nthe conduct that is inconsistent with the party’s prior statements or conduct when the other party, \nacting to his/her/its detriment, has reasonably relied on them ” {C9.1/24/11}. Tellingly, Mr \nAlyoshin replaced the above passage with ellipsis ‘[…]’ when quoting from this ruling \nat Alyoshin3/¶65 {C9.1/1/30}. That was plainly a breach of his duty to bring \ninconsistent material to the attention of the Court: {Day32/46:24} - {Day32/48:20}. \n(3) Alyoshin3/¶67 – Chornomornaftogaz (No. 2):598 “The doctrine of venire contra factum \nproprium is based on the principle of good faith.

On the \ncontrary, it is apparent from the cases (even as summarised by Mr Alyoshin) that detrimental \nreliance was either obvious or presumed: see Beketov11/¶140 {C9.2/1/56}.  \n662 Mr Alyoshin’s new position is also contrary to that taken by Mr Nahnybida: see \nNahnybida4/¶125 {C9/1/27} (quoting the Supreme Court’s ruling at {C9/3/650}).  \n \n597  PrivatBank v Hot Tours Agencies, decision of the Supreme Court dated 1.12.21 in Case No. 752/14554/15-\nts. \n598  Chornomornaftogaz (No. 2), decision of the Supreme Court dated 30.8.22 in Case No. 904/1427/21. \n599  Person 1 v Neos Bank, decision of the Supreme Court dated 6.1.23 in Case No. 335/736/17.  \n600  Alfa Bank v Person 1, decision of the Supreme Court dated 1.2.23 in case no. 183/3783/15-ts.  \n601  Ustia Agro v Piatyhirsk Farming Enterprise, decision of the North-Western Commercial Court of Appeals \ndated 10.11.22 in Case No. 918/84/22. \nAA2/15/344\n338 (c) Whose reliance is required?   \n663 Mr Alyoshin’s position is that “ reliance by a third party is a relevant consideration ” when applying \nthe VCFP principle. He also contends that the Court should not draw a “ formalistic distinction ” \nbetween D1 and the Borrowers / Intermediary Borrowers / New Borrowers such that \nreliance by those companies on the Bank’s conduct might ‘count’ as reliance by D1 \n(notwithstanding that he denies ownership/control of them): see Alyoshin3/¶¶71.1-71.2 \n{C9.1/1/33}. This is a bad point: ( i) it is only tentatively advanced by Mr Alyoshin (third \nparty reliance is a “ relevant consideration ”, not a sufficient consideration) and ( ii) the Two Land \nPlots case {C9.1/27/1} relied on by Mr Alyoshin does not support his position: \nBeketov11/¶¶145-149 {C9.2/1/58}. \n664 As for D1’s case that he can establish reasonable reliance via the conduct of the Borrowers \n/ Intermediary Borrowers / New Borrowers:  \n(1) As Mr Beketov recognises, if D1 had himself relied on the Bank’s conduct to his \ndetriment ( e.g. by procuring companies he controls to enter into transactions), that \nmight create a basis on which D1 could demonstrate reasonable reliance \n(Beketov11/¶156 {C9.2/1/61}, {Day28/63:4-25}). But D1 has not adduced any \nevidence that he relied on the Bank’s conduct when he procured the Borrowers / \nIntermediary Borrowers / New Borrowers to do anything (even in his now-\nabandoned trial evidence).  \n(2) Furthermore, it would be absurd if D1 could rely on the VCFP principle in respect of \nthe Bank’s conduct in treating loans or payments as valid at a time when he and D2 \nwere in control of the Bank. That would be tantamount to D1 relying on his own \nfraudulent conduct to create a defence to his own fraud. \n(3) Even more absurd is the suggestion at Alyoshin3/¶71.2 {C9.1/1/33} that D1 should \nbe able to rely on the actions of the New Borrowers as his own detrimental reliance if \nthe Court finds, contrary to"}

If D1 has advanced a deliberately dishonest \ncase, it can scarcely be said that permitting D1 to rely on the VCFP doctrine would be \ncompatible with the principles of “ good faith and reasonableness ”. \n(d) Reliance on prior conduct \n665 Mr Beketov’s view is that the VCFP principle must be invoked by pointing to reliance on \nprior inconsistent conduct ( i.e. there are two acts which are inconsistent, and reliance must \nbe placed on the former): Beketov11/¶¶160-162 {C9.2/1/62}. This point is not addressed \nAA2/15/345\n339 by Mr Alyoshin, although it clearly follows from the Supreme Court case law set out above. \nDespite the indication in D1 Opening/¶208 {AA3/1/172} that this would be addressed in \nXX, Mr Beketov’s position was not challenged over 2½ days of his evidence.  \n(e) Reasonableness and bad faith \n666 There is a further question as to whether the VCFP principle requires the party acting \ninconsistently to have done so in bad faith, and/or whether the relying party had acted \nreasonably. There may be nothing between the experts here: \n(1) Mr Alyoshin’s (revised) view is that the VCFP principle could be invoked if the Bank’s \ninconsistent conduct was “ unfair or unconscionable ”: Alyoshin3/¶69 {C9.1/1/32}. \nNevertheless, when it was put to him that the Supreme Court resolution in \nChornomornaftogaz (No. 2) {C2/18/2} showed that a party could seek to recover \ndebts under an agreement and then later seek to invalidate the agreement without \nbreaching the VCFP principle because it was acting in good faith in seeking redress \nfor violation of its rights, he claimed that the decision was “ extremely case-specific ” and \n(it seems) the Supreme Court was wrong: {Day32/31:22} - {Day32/33:11}. \n(2) Mr Beketov’s view is that it is necessary to show that the party who has engaged in \ninconsistent conduct has done so in bad faith (Beketov9/¶108(c) {C6/1/41}, ¶113(b) \n{C6/1/43}) and it is likewise necessary to show that the relying party acted reasonably \n(Beketov11/¶¶158-159 {C9.2/1/61}). This view was not challenged.  \n(3) The Supreme Court cases cited state that the VCFP principle derives from principles \nof good faith and reasonableness. Many of them expressly refer to the party’s \ninconsistent conduct as undertaken contrary to the principle of good faith.  \n(4) It is agreed that the VCFP principle is ultimately discretionary: it cannot be applied \ncontrary to the overriding requirements of good faith and reasonableness.  \n(f) The VCFP principle: summary \n667 It follows that the VCFP principle is a discretionary remedy which applies where: \n(1) A claimant is seeking to have a voidable transaction declared invalid;  \n(2) That claimant has previously acted inconsistently, by treating the transaction as valid; \n(3) In applying to have the transaction declared invalid, the claimant has violated the \nprinciple of good faith ( i.e. it has acted in bad faith); \nAA2/15/346\n340 (4) The defendant has reasonably relied upon the claimant’s prior conduct (in treating the \ntransaction as valid);   \n(5) Such reliance has been to the defendant’s detriment; and \n(6) The claimant’s conduct overall is in bad faith.  \n(2) Other alleged grounds for preclusion: abuse of rights \n668 D1Def/¶88(1)(a) {A1/8/53} asserts that the Bank’s claim cannot succeed because it has \ntreated the Relevant, Intermediary and New Loans as valid and, having done so, “ it is acting \nin bad"}

Mr Alyoshin appears to \nsupport the view that “ claims or assertions made in bad faith are liable to be dismissed regardless of the \nsubstantive merits ”: Alyoshin3/¶45 {C9.1/1/25}.  \n669 As discussed in Section I , Ukrainian law contains a prohibition against abuse of rights, \nwhich may be invoked in a variety of circumstances: see also Beketov11/¶224(a) \n{C9.2/1/85}. However, it has two relevant limitations: \n(1) It cannot be invoked to uphold a void transaction (for the same reasons that the VCFP \nprinciple cannot be so invoked: see above); and \n(2) Where the alleged bad faith arises from inconsistent conduct, the general rule against \nabusive conduct must yield to the specific requirements of the VCFP principle. As Mr \nBeketov explains, there would be no need for the VCFP principle at all if proof of bad \nfaith alone would suffice to preclude a claimant’s claim: Beketov11/¶¶230-231 \n{C9.2/1/88}. Mr Beketov’s view was not challenged in XX.  \n(3) Approbation and reprobation in English law \n670 Recognising the multiple difficulties he faces in relation to VCFP and abuse of rights, D1 \nnow contends that the Bank is precluded from contending the loans are void / voidable on \nthe basis of the purported English law principle that a party cannot approbate and reprobate: \nD1Def/¶88(1)(c) {A1/8/53}, D1 Opening/¶¶209-215 {AA3/1/72}. There are three \nanswers to this. \n671 First, there is no separate or distinct principle of ‘approbate and reprobate’ in English law: \n(1) In Lissenden v CAV Bosch [1940] A.C. 412 (HL) at 417B ff {M1/3.2/6}, Viscount \nMaugham explained that it is “ now settled by decisions in this house that there is no difference at \nall” between the Scottish doctrine of ‘approbate and reprobate’ and the English \n{AA2/15/222}\nAA2/15/347\n341 (equitable) doctrine of waiver and election (see too Lord Atkin at 429A, Lord Wright \nat 435B-E). He cited three other House of Lords opinions in support of that \nproposition.  \n(2) There is no support for the proposition that, since Lissenden, the English courts have \ndeveloped a free-standing principle of ‘approbate and reprobate’. Or, if they have, it \nhas developed on a misreading of the decision in Express Newspapers v News (UK) \nLtd [1990] 1 WLR 1320 {M1/6.1.1}:  \n(a) In Express Newspapers at 1329 {M1/6.1.1/10}, Browne-Wilkinson V-C \nreferred to a “ principle of law of general application that it is not possible to approbate and \nreprobate …” but Lissenden was not cited, and his commentary was per incuriam . \nIn any event, the case was unusual in that the claimant obtained judgment \nagainst the defendant for breach of copyright; the defendant counterclaimed \nagainst the claimant for breach of copyright on the basis of “ legally \nindistinguishable…facts ”; and the Court held that the claimant could not obtain \njudgment against the defendant and also resist the defendant’s counterclaim. \n(b) In Ashworth (Holdings) v Ballard (Kent) Ltd [2000] Ch 12 at 31 {M1/8.2/20}, \nRobert Walker LJ referred to, in passing, “ the principle that a party to litigation cannot \n‘appropriate and reprobate’ ” but noted that the point had not been argued; Laws LJ \nexpressly said he made no comment on the point (p. 32E); the case was decided \non another point; and, as the Deputy Judge recognised in Twinsectra at [81]-\n[82] (see below), Robert Walker LJ"}
{"start": 955500, "text": "ant and also resist the defendant’s counterclaim. \n(b) In Ashworth (Holdings) v Ballard (Kent) Ltd [2000] Ch 12 at 31 {M1/8.2/20}, \nRobert Walker LJ referred to, in passing, “ the principle that a party to litigation cannot \n‘appropriate and reprobate’ ” but noted that the point had not been argued; Laws LJ \nexpressly said he made no comment on the point (p. 32E); the case was decided \non another point; and, as the Deputy Judge recognised in Twinsectra at [81]-\n[82] (see below), Robert Walker LJ’s comments were obiter. \n(3) D1 puts considerable emphasis on the decision of Jeremy Cousins QC (sitting as a \nDeputy Judge) in Twinsectra v Lloyds Bank [2018] EWHC 672 (Ch) {M1/20.1.1}. It \nis correct that the Deputy Judge concluded in that case that “ the doctrine of approbation \nand reprobation has now become an established feature of English law (and it would seem Scots law) \nfor the wider principle described in Express Newspapers ”: [87]. There was no basis for that \ndecision and the Deputy Judge’s own reasoning does not support it: ( i) at [83], he \naccepted that “ the Court of Appeal’s decision in Ashworth did not extend the application of the \ndoctrine…beyond what was described in Lissenden ”; (ii) at [84]-[86], he appeared to rely on \nthe apparent development of the doctrine in Scotland; and ( iii) at [87], he concluded \nthat the doctrine was as set out in Express Newspapers without acknowledging that \nthe Court of Appeal in that case had not referred to Lissenden. \nAA2/15/348\n342 (4) The Deputy Judge’s decision in Twinsectra was also apparently made without \nreference to (or citation of) ED&F Man Sugar v T&L Sugars [2016] EWHC 272 \n(Comm) at [14] - [16] {M1/18/4-5}, in which Leggatt J rejected the suggestion that \nthe claimant could not advance two inconsistent cases against different parties in \ndifferent proceedings.  \n(5) The Bank accepts that there are principles of English law which limit a party’s ability \nto pursue inconsistent conduct, including ( i) election between mutually inconsistent \nrights ( e.g. the doctrines of waiver and election); ( ii) election after judgment between \ninconsistent remedies ( e.g. the choice between damages and an account of profits); and \n(iii) the equitable doctrine of election which prevents a person from taking the benefit \nof a disposition under an instrument while rejecting other conditions contained in the \ninstrument (as described in Snell’s Equity, at ¶6-012 {M1/33.3/6}). D1 has not \npleaded or particularised his reliance on any of those principles. Nor could those \nprinciples sensibly be invoked to preclude the Bank from bringing its claim against \nD1-2 in these proceedings: see Jyske Bank (below).602  \n672 Secondly, if (contrary to the above), there is a distinct English law principle of ‘approbate \nand reprobate’, it is a derivation of the English law equitable doctrine of election and, as \nsuch, is a substantive issue governed by the lex causae .603 \n673 Thirdly, and if (contrary to the above), there is an English law procedural rule of approbating \nand reprobating, it has no application on the facts: see below.  \n(4) Allegedly inconsistent conduct relied on by the Defendants \n674 The allegedly inconsistent conduct relied on by Ds is that the Bank has treated the Relevant, \nIntermediary and New Loans as valid “ as between itself and the counterparties to the respective \ntransactions ” and has “ treated them as having been wholly or partially repaid in maintaining its accounts \nwith those parties and for the purpose of compiling its financial statements ” D1Def/¶88(1) {A1/8/53}. \nAlthough not entirely clear from that plea, D1 Opening/¶¶199(1)-(5) {AA2/1/68} \nidentifies what the Bank is said to have done in treating the loans as valid:  \n \n602  See too Johnson v Agnew [1980] AC 367 at 398 {M1/4.1/32}: “ Election, though the subject of much learning and \nrefinement, is in the end a doctrine based on simple considerations of common sense and equity ”. \n603  Equitable doctrines by w"}

We note as a starting point that, in both English \nand Ukrainian law, a party which has sued on an agreement in order to recover debts (or has \nin fact recovered money under a loan) is not precluded from seeking to protect their rights \nby subsequently invalidating the agreement / loan, and suing wrongdoers for loss:  \n(1) In Chormonaftogaz (No. 1) at [5.4.2] {C2/18/17}, the Supreme Court explained that \nthe “[ e]xistence of a court judgment recovering debts from the Respondent under the Agreement does \nnot restrict their right to sue for the invalidation of the Agreement and does not preclude the possibility \nof litigation in such a case, but on the contrary, indicates the need for this as the only possible way for \nthe Claimant to defend their rights and interest, which they consider to have been violated ”. \n(2) In Jyske Bank (Gibraltar) Ltd v Spjeldnaes (CA, unrep, 29.7.99), Nourse LJ explained \nthat “ the suggestion that a bank, which, suspecting or even knowing that its moneys have, with the \nconnivance of the borrowers, been fraudulently misapplied in the guise of a loan, calls it in or takes \nsteps to preserve or enforce its security, thereby curtails its rights to recover its moneys, is absurd. It is \nentitled, without risk of nonsuiting itself, to take very step available in order to achieve that end ” \n{M1/7/24 }. \n676 The overriding answer to Ds’ case is that the Bank, as a victim of fraud, has been doing all \nit can to mitigate its losses caused by them. In all the circumstances, its allegations in these \nproceedings that the fraudulent loans are void cannot be said to be unconscionable, \nunreasonable or in bad faith.  \n(a) Recording purported repayments in the Bank’s books \n677 The Bank does not dispute that, while it was under D1-2’s control, it recorded the Relevant \nand Intermediary Loans as repaid by a combination of Intermediary Drawdowns, the \nTransferred Assets at their Credit Values, and the New Loans. The Bank further accepts \nthat, while it was under D1-2’s control, it did not suggest (to the Borrowers, Intermediary \nBorrowers, Asset Transferors or New Borrowers) that the Relevant, Intermediary and/or \nNew Loans may be void or voidable. \nAA2/15/350\n344 678 From 21.12.17, the Bank has made its position clear, in these proceedings, that it considers \nthe Relevant, Intermediary and New Loans to be void. And, since amendments to the Reply \nin July 2021, the Bank has made its position clear that it will reduce the loss it claims in these \nproceedings by reference to the true value of the Transferred Assets which are properly \nattributable to the Relevant Drawdowns, rather than the assets’ fraudulently inflated Credit \nValue (see Reply/¶¶27F.6 - 27F.8 {A1/25/41}).  \n679 The Bank’s conduct does not preclude it from advancing "}
{"start": 962500, "text": ", that it considers \nthe Relevant, Intermediary and New Loans to be void. And, since amendments to the Reply \nin July 2021, the Bank has made its position clear that it will reduce the loss it claims in these \nproceedings by reference to the true value of the Transferred Assets which are properly \nattributable to the Relevant Drawdowns, rather than the assets’ fraudulently inflated Credit \nValue (see Reply/¶¶27F.6 - 27F.8 {A1/25/41}).  \n679 The Bank’s conduct does not preclude it from advancing its case that the Relevant, \nIntermediary and New Loans are void or voidable in these proceedings on any of the \ngrounds relied on by Ds: \n(1) First, the VCFP principle / abuse of rights doctrine cannot apply so as to uphold the \nRelevant, Intermediary and New Loans, all of which are void transactions.  \n(2) Secondly, in order to invoke the VCFP principle, D1 must show that he reasonably \nrelied on the Bank’s treatment of those loans as valid to his detriment. As to that:  \n(a) D1 has adduced no evidence that he reasonably relied on the Bank’s treatment \nof the loans as valid.  \n(b) Ds cannot rely on the Bank’s alleged treatment of the loans as valid before \nnationalisation. It would be absurd for D1-2 to contend that they procured the \nBank to grant the fraudulent loans and thereafter to treat them as valid, and that \nthey reasonably relied on their own fraudulent conduct to their own detriment. \n(c) D1 contends that the Borrowers have relied on the Bank’s statements of their \naccounts and treatment of the payments they made as valid \n(D1Def/¶88(1)(b)(ii) {A1/8/53}). But D2’s case that the Borrowers and \nIntermediary Borrowers were a “ flotilla of convenient vessels ” which operated as part \nof a loan recycling scheme, directed from within the Bank, is fundamentally \ninconsistent with the proposition that those entities reasonably relied to their \ndetriment on the Bank’s treatment of their loans as valid and/or repaid. The \nBorrowers and Intermediary Borrowers knew they were granted the loans as \npart of a fraudulent scheme to which the Bank was also a party. To the extent \nthe Bank treated their loans as valid, that was simply a part of the fraud, and \nD1-2 (and their companies) knew that was the case.  \nAA2/15/351\n345 (d) Nor can D1-2 be said to have reasonably relied to their detriment on the Bank’s \nalleged treatment of the loans as valid post-nationalisation. The Bank has set \nout its position in these proceedings that the loans are void.  \n(3) Thirdly, in relation to the Bank’s acceptance and retention of the Transferred Assets:  \n(a) There is no evidence that D1 or D2 procured the transfer of the Transferred \nAssets to the Bank in reasonable reliance on the Bank’s treatment of the \nRelevant and Intermediary Loans as valid. Nor could there be: D1 and D2 had \nprocured those fraudulent loans and knew they were void or voidable.  \n(b) D1-2 transferred their assets to the Bank because they were obliged to \nrecapitalise it pursuant to NBU Resolution 103/BT; they owned the Bank; and \nit was in their interests to seek to recapitalise it: Reply/¶24B.3(4) {A1/25/31}. \n(c) D1-2 have not suffered any detriment as a result of transferring their assets to \nthe Bank to reduce the balance on the Relevant and Intermediary Loans ( ibid.). \nThe Bank has accepted that its loss in these proceedings is to be reduced by \nreference to the true value of those assets. D1-2 cannot contend that ( i) they \nhave suffered a detriment because the Bank is not prepared to reduce its loss by \nreference to the fraudulently inflated Credit Values contained in the Mortgages, \nor (ii) the Bank is acting in bad faith or unconscionably in only reducing its loss \nby reference to the true (rather than the fraudulent) values of the Transferred \nAssets,  or ( iii) they reasonably relied on the Bank (under their control) entering \nthe fraudulently inflated Credit Values into the Bank’s records.  \n(4) Fourthly, even if the Bank is wrong on the above, the Court should reject "}

Had they intended to pursue a case that the \nBank had acted in bad faith, it was incumbent on them to put that allegation.  \n(b) Treatment of the loans as valid during the period in which the Bank was under \nD1-2’s control, and during the period in which the fraud was being perpetrated \nand covered up, cannot be relied upon as bad faith conduct by the Bank .  \nAA2/15/352\n346 (c) After nationalisation, the Bank investigated the multiple frauds perpetrated \nagainst it by D1-2 and has set out its case that the loans are void as soon as \nreasonably practicable.  \n(d) Since nationalisation, the Bank has acted with a view to recovering as much as \npossible of the losses caused by the Misappropriation. If the Bank has treated \nany of the Relevant, Intermediary or New Loans as valid, or has sought to \nenforce the security it was purportedly granted in relation to those loans, or has \notherwise adopted stances in Ukraine which are not consistent with the Bank’s \nposition in these proceedings, the Bank has done so in good faith in order to \nmitigate its loss in respect of Ds’ fraud. None of the Bank’s alleged conduct (if \nit be proved) has been in bad faith or abusive. See Reply/¶24B.4 {A1/25/32}. \n(b) Ukrainian proceedings \n680 D1 relies on six Ukrainian cases in which he contends that the Bank has treated one or more \nRelevant, Intermediary or New Loan as valid: see D1Def/¶87C-87F {A1/8/51}, D1 \nOpening/App. E {AA3/1/169}. The Bank does not accept that it has acted inconsistently \nin any of those six cases, and has set out its position at Reply/¶¶39-43 {A1/25/70}.  \n681 The Bank makes the following preliminary points: \n(1) First, with one exception (proceedings relating to the Tamersa Relevant Loan), the \nrelevant proceedings were commenced by companies owned and/or controlled by \nD1-2 after the Bank’s claim in these proceedings had been issued (see the table  \nbelow). In those circumstances, none of the Bank’s conduct in those proceedings can \nhave constituted “ prior conduct ” so as to invoke the VCFP principle. \n(2) Secondly, in those five sets of proceedings issued between 2019 and 2022, D1-2’s \ncompanies have sought to ‘bait’ the Bank into making statements in relation to loan \nagreements or mortgages which might then be deployed in the English proceedings \nas part of a VCFP defence. That is particularly striking where D1-2’s companies have \nrelied on the Bank’s POC in these proceedings as a basis to invalidate loans or \nmortgages in Ukraine (see e.g. the Golden Proceedings at {I1/90/2} pursued by D1-\n2 to seek to reclaim Hotel Zirka from the Bank, whilst at the same time seeking to \nclaim credit for the value of Hotel Zirka in these proceedings: see Bank \nOpening/¶619-620). D1-2 have acted in bad faith and/or are abusing their rights in \npursuing those claims for the collateral purpose of generating statements by the Bank \nwhich they might then deploy in these proceedings.  \nAA2/15/353\n347 (3) Thirdly, D1-2 have not filed any evidence that they reasonably relied on any of the \nstatements made by the Bank in those five sets of proceedings to their detriment. By \nthe time those proceedings were issued, D1-2 knew that the Bank’s case in these \nproceedings was that the loans were "}

By \nthe time those proceedings were issued, D1-2 knew that the Bank’s case in these \nproceedings was that the loans were void.  \n(4) Fourthly, as set out above, even if the Bank has treated loans or mortgages as valid in \nthose proceedings, it has acted reasonably and in good faith with a view to mitigating \nits loss caused by D1-2’s conduct: Reply/¶¶39-43 {A1/25/69}. The VCFP principle \nand/or abuse of rights doctrine can have no application. \n(5) Finally, the six sets of proceedings only relate to 25 Relevant Loans, 7 Intermediary \nLoans, two Mortgages and two New Loans: Reply/¶24B.4(2) {A1/25/32}. They do \nnot form a basis on which to the VCFP principle or abuse of rights doctrine could be \nengaged more widely. \n682 As to whether the Bank has taken an inconsistent position in the relevant proceedings: \n(1) The Bank accepts that certain of its conduct has been inconsistent with the Relevant, \nIntermediary and New Loans being void, in particular: ( i) bringing a claim against \nTamersa for repayment of the Tamersa Loan (Reply/¶41.1 {A1/25/73}) and ( ii)  \nsending termination notices to Like City and Business Prom Innovatsiya ( “BPI” ), two \nNew Borrowers, in September 2017 (Reply/¶40.1.1 {A1/25/72}, {E17/179.1}, \n{E17/179.2}).  \n(2) There is a disagreement between the experts as to the position the Bank took in five \nsets of proceedings, summarised below: \nProceedings Issue date  Alyoshin Beketov \nLike City & \nBPI \nProceedings \n(New \nBorrowers) 14.10.21 \n& \n5.11.21 \n{I1/102} \n{I1/106} The Ukrainian court found that \nthe Like City and BPI New \nLoan agreements were valid \nand lawful and this was not \ncontested by the parties. \nAlyoshin3/¶¶11-12, 15.1-15.2 \n{C9.1/1/7} The Bank took the position that the \nvalidity of the Like City and BPI \nNew Loans was outside the subject \nof proof, and made no positive \nassertions that the loan agreements \nwere valid. \nBeketov11/¶¶180-184 {C9.2/1/68}  \nAEF /  \nHotel Mir \nProceedings 8.11.19 \n{I1/92} “The Appellate Court in the AEF \ncase established that there were no \nfacts which made the [AEF loan \nagreement ] void due to a violation of \npublic policy. ” \nAlyoshin3/¶¶37-41 \n{C9.1/1/22} The Bank’s filings use language \nwhich is arguably consistent with \nthe AEF loan being valid, but the \nvalidity of the AEF loan was not \ndirectly addressed, and the Bank \ndefended the proceedings on the \nbasis that AEF and Artis’s rights \nhad not been violated. \nBeketov11/¶¶185-205 {C9.2/1/71}  \nAA2/15/354\n348 Oceanmash \nProceedings 2.7.20 \n{I1/112} “The position the Bank adopted in \nOceanmash demonstrates that the \nBank has treated both the Loan \nAgreement [with Karinda ] and the \nMortgage Agreement as valid, \nbinding and enforceable… ” \nAlyoshin3/¶¶72-76 \n{C9.1/1/33} The Bank could be said to have \ndescribed the Oceanmash Mortgage \nand the Karinda loans in language \nwhich is consistent with them being \nvalid, but the validity of the loans \nand mortgage was not in issue and \nnot the subject of proof in the \nproceedings.  \nBeketov11/¶¶206-219 {C9.2/1/78}  \nGolden \nProceedings 9.12.21 \n{I1/90} The Bank accepted that the \nloans in question were valid and \ndid not attempt to suggest that \nthey were void or voidable. \nAlyoshin3/¶¶6-9, 70 \n{C9.1/1/5} The Bank expressly referred to the \nfact that the invalidity of the \nRelevant Loans was an issue in \ndispute in the English proceedings, \nto be resolved in England.  \nBeketov11/¶¶167-179 {C9.2/1/64}  \n(3) Resolving the above disputes requires the Court to engage in a detailed analysis of the \nissues in each set of proceedings, the statements made by the Bank in its statements \nof case in those procee"}
{"start": 973000, "text": "d \ndid not attempt to suggest that \nthey were void or voidable. \nAlyoshin3/¶¶6-9, 70 \n{C9.1/1/5} The Bank expressly referred to the \nfact that the invalidity of the \nRelevant Loans was an issue in \ndispute in the English proceedings, \nto be resolved in England.  \nBeketov11/¶¶167-179 {C9.2/1/64}  \n(3) Resolving the above disputes requires the Court to engage in a detailed analysis of the \nissues in each set of proceedings, the statements made by the Bank in its statements \nof case in those proceedings, and whether those statements constituted inconsistent \nconduct. Mr Beketov has performed this analysis fairly in his report, and his views \nshould be adopted by the Court. Indeed, Mr Beketov’s analysis was not challenged by \nD1. \n683 Accordingly, and taken at its highest, the Court may conclude: ( i) the Bank has used language \nwhich is consistent with the AEF Relevant Loan and Hotel Mir Mortgage being valid (Hotel \nMir Proceedings); ( ii) the Bank has used language which is consistent with the Karinda \nRelevant Loans and Oceanmash Mortgage being valid (the Oceanmash Proceedings); ( iii) \n(as the Bank accepts) the notices of termination it sent to Like City and BPI in September \n2017 are inconsistent with the New Loans being void; and ( iv) (as the Bank accepts) the \nTamersa Relevant Loan was treated as valid in proceedings brought by the Bank against \nTamersa.  \n684 None of that conduct gets D1-2 anywhere close to showing that the VCFP principle applies \nor that the Bank is abusing its rights:  \n(1) Hotel Mir Proceedings. The result of these proceedings is that the Bank has lost title \nto Hotel Mir, which is now owned by companies owned and/or controlled by D1-2:  \nReply/¶¶39.7.3-39.7.4 {A1/25/71} and Bank Opening/¶¶617-618 {AA2/1/241}. \nFar from D1-2 relying on the Bank’s allegedly inconsistent conduct in the Hotel Mir \nProceedings to their detriment, they have re-acquired Hotel Mir to the detriment of \nthe Bank.  \nAA2/15/355\n349 (2) Oceanmash Proceedings. The status of the Oceanmash Mortgage and Karinda \nRelevant Loans was not central to this claim, which related to the technicalities by \nwhich the Oceanmash Mortgage was enforced in 2016 (while both Oceanmash and \nthe Bank were under D1-2’s control). The Ukrainian court found that Oceanmash had \nbrought those proceedings in bad faith because it had willingly mortgaged the \nOceanmash office building to the Bank in 2016 but was seeking, four years later, to \navoid that transaction at the expense of the Bank {C9.1/29/16} (¶6.33). In other \nwords, the Ukrainian court found that it is D1-2 who were guilty of inconsistent and \nbad faith conduct, not the Bank. In any event, the Bank has acted reasonably and in \ngood faith in seeking to retain the Oceanmash office building to mitigate the losses \ncaused by D1-2’s conduct.  \n(3) Like City/BPI termination notices. The Bank sent the termination notices in \nSeptember 2017, before it had fully uncovered D1-2’s fraudulent conduct: \nReply/¶¶23.1A, 40.1.4 {A1/25/72}. The Bank’s other conduct in respect of Like City \nand BPI’s New Loans shows that, once the Bank had uncovered more of the fraud, it \nhas not sought to enforce repayment of the same (for example, the ‘Stop Instruction’ \ngiven in October 2017 to prevent any claims being issued against the New Borrowers: \nHryn/¶21 {B1/16/6}). In any event: ( i) Like City and BPI made only de minimis  \npayments between the date of each termination notice and the issue of these \nproceedings;604 and ( ii) the Bank has agreed to reduce its loss in these proceedings by \nreference to those payments. D1-2 have therefore suffered no detriment.  \n(4) Tamersa Relevant Loan. The Bank obtained judgment in the Tamersa Proceedings, \nbut Tamersa has not paid a kopek of the judgment debt (and D1 accepts that \nTamersa’s Relevant Loan remains outstanding: D1Def/¶15 {A1/8/12}). In those \ncircumstances, Ds have not suffered any detriment as a result of the Bank treating the \nTamersa Relevant Loan as valid in those proc"}

In those \ncircumstances, Ds have not suffered any detriment as a result of the Bank treating the \nTamersa Relevant Loan as valid in those proceedings. \n(c) The Bank’s financial statements \n685 The Bank accepts that, prior to nationalisation, it treated the Relevant and Intermediary \nLoans as valid for the purpose of compiling its 2013, 2014 and 2015 financial statements. \nFor the reasons above, D1-2 cannot rely on the Bank’s pre-nationalisation treatment of the \n \n604  See Thompson2/App 6-1-2-2 {D1/424}. Between 30.8.17 and 30.11.17, Like City made payments of UAH \n2.2m (US$86,363) and BPI made payments of UAH 1.7m (US$64,664).  \nAA2/15/356\n350 fraudulent loans as constituting inconsistent conduct so as to invoke the VCFP principle or \nabuse of rights doctrine. \n686 The Bank’s 2016 financial statements record UAH 137bn in New Loans with an impairment \nof UAH 135bn (see {K1/6/34}). The Bank’s subsequent financial statements have likewise \ntreated the New Loans as fully impaired (see e.g. the 2018 financial statements at \n{K1/6.3/56}). As to that:  \n(1) The New Loans are void transactions. The VCFP principle / abuse of rights doctrine \nhave no application.  \n(2) The New Loans were fraudulent loans procured by D1-2 while they were in control \nof the Bank. The Court should reject the contention that D1-2 have reasonably relied \nto their detriment on any post-nationalisation conduct by the Bank as treating those \nfraudulent loans as valid.  \n(3) There is no evidence that D1-2 (or the New Borrowers, even if their conduct were \nrelevant) have reasonably relied on the Bank’s financial statements as constituting \nassertions by the Bank that the New Loans are valid. Indeed, it is difficult to see what \nD1-2 could have relied upon in the Bank’s financial statements: the impairment shows \nthat the Bank does not expect to recover anything from the New Borrowers. \n(4) Insofar as the Bank has treated the New Loans as valid and D1-2 have relied on that \ntreatment, they have not done so to their detriment. The Bank has agreed to reduce \nits loss by reference to the principal repayments made on the New Loans. \n(5) The Bank’s willingness to accept even de minimis  sums from the New Borrowers is \nconduct undertaken reasonably and in good faith with a view to mitigating the Bank’s \nlosses: see Reply/¶24B.4(1) {A1/25/32}.  \n(5) Preclusion: summary  \n687 The Court should reject Ds’ preclusion defences for the reasons given above. In summary:   \n(1) The VCFP principle does not apply inter alia  because ( i) Ds have not shown that they \nreasonably relied on the Bank’s allegedly inconsistent conduct to their detriment; ( ii) \nthe allegedly inconsistent conduct generally postdates the Bank’s claims in these \nproceedings (and took place at a time when Ds were well aware of the Bank’s position \nthat the loans were void/voidable); and ( iii) to the extent the Bank has acted \ninconsistently in treating the loans as valid ( e.g. in Ukrainian proceedings), and the \nAA2/15/357\n351 conduct relied upon here really is footling, it has done so reasonably and in good faith \nwith a view to mitigating its losses caused by Ds’ unlawful conduct.  \n(2) The abuse of rights doctrine has no application. The Bank has acted reasonably and \nin good faith. Ds have suffered no prejudice as a result of any of the allegedly \ninconsistent conduct by the Bank. \n(3) The English law rule against approbation and reprobation (if it exists) is a principle of \nsubstantive law and does not apply.

Even if it does apply, it does not preclude the \nBank from contending that the loans are void / voidable. \n• • • \nM CAUSATION AND LOSS  \n688 The Bank’s case on loss is straightforward: the Relevant Drawdowns which D1-2 \nfraudulently procured were misappropriations of the Bank’s money; they caused loss in the \namounts which were extracted. That loss was materially reduced only by ( i) true repayment \ni.e. where Relevant Drawdowns were reversed (Relevant Drawdowns repaying Relevant \nDrawdowns); or ( ii) the true value of the Transferred Assets. \n689 Ds, for their part, raise two defences: the  Repayment Defence , which focuses on the ledger \nentries recording repayment of the purported contractual debt under the Relevant Loans \nand the  Use of Funds Defence  which focusses on what Ds did with the sums that they \nmisappropriated. \n690 Whilst it seemed to be suggested for some time that the Repayment Defence and the Use \nof Funds Defence could be used in combination, that position now appears to have been \nabandoned: Mr Davidson explained that he had been instructed that “ it is not permissible under \nUkrainian law ” to combine the two defences. The Use of Funds Defence now appears only \nto be advanced as some sort of contingent alternative argument. The Ukrainian law experts \nare agreed that the Use of Funds Defence is not available as a matter of Ukrainian law.605 \nDs, nonetheless, seek to maintain through Mr Alyoshin that if the Repayment Defence fails \nthen somehow the Use of Funds Defence can spring back to life.606 That is wholly \nunprincipled. Ukrainian law does not somehow change to suit Ds in the event that the Court \nrejects their other quantum defence. \n \n605  UkrJR/¶45.2 {C5/1/20}. \n606  D1 says that “ if the repayment defence were to be rejected, then that would suggest that the use of funds defence would have to \nsucceed…it’s, we suggest, not possibly coherently to reject both ” (MHKC {Day6/43:23} - {Day6/44:1}). \nAA2/15/358\n352 691 The Court should also reject the Repayment Defence for the following headline reasons: \n(1) The Repayment Defence proceeds on the basis that the Bank was fully compensated \nfor the loss suffered by the Bank as a result of the Misappropriation. Ds rely in this \nregard on the Intermediary Loans, New Loans and Asset Transfer with inflated Credit \nValues. These steps resulted in almost all of the Relevant Loan balances being reduced \nto zero in the Bank’s books (there was a reduction of one set of purported loan \nbalances to zero and the creation of others). But the key point is that (save only for \nthe true values of Transferred Assets) they did not compensate the Bank for the loss \narising from the Misappropriation. They just disguised it in a different way. \n(2) The Intermediary and New Loans provided no compensation to the Bank for the loss \nof its money through the 270 Relevant Drawdowns. Rather, there was circular money \nmovement (Bank → Intermediary Borrower/New Borrower → Borrower → Bank), \nwhich manifestly provided zero true value or replenishment of loss to the Bank. \n(3) In considering the Intermediary and New Loans, there is a fundamental distinction to \nbe drawn between the Bank’s loss occasioned by the Relevant Drawdowns and the \npurported ‘debt’ recorded in the Bank’s books. Steps to manipulate the latter do not \nreduce the former unless they involve true additional money or assets being provided \nto the Bank.  \n(4) That is so irrespective of whether the purported contractual debt (or even the actual \nrestitutionary liability owed by the Borrower to the Bank) is ‘extinguished’ by the \nfurther fraudulent devices employed by D1-2"}

In the end, under Ukrainian law, the \nissue is whether the Bank’s loss from the Relevant Drawdowns has in fact been \ncompensated – as Ukrainian law makes clear that the Bank is entitled to“ full \ncompensation ”. The further frauds, and further void loans, with associated circular \npayments did not do that. They just changed the paper trail at the Bank. \n(5) The same point applies to the Asset Transfer using inflated Credit Values. The Bank’s \nloss from the Misappropriation is a question of fact and is only reduced by the true \nvalue of the assets which were transferred. And, again, that is so irrespective of how \nD1-2 chose to manipulate the Bank’s books and its purported contractual debts. \n692 There is no conceptual or practical difficulty in rejecting both the Use of Funds and \nRepayment Defences. It does not require the Court to engage in “ legal and accounting \nAA2/15/359\n353 exceptionalism ” (cp. D2 Opening/¶21 {AA4/1/10}). The Bank suffered an immediate loss \ncaused by the Relevant Drawdowns: monies were taken from it unlawfully by D1-2. The \nfact that this loss is not reduced either by subsequent steps to disguise it and have it reflected \nin different book entries or if the fraudsters spent it paying off other liabilities simply reflects \nthat both these defences are bad. \n693 The structure of the remainder of this Section is as follows: \n(1) Section M1 : The Ukrainian law evidence. \n(2) Section M2 : The forensic accountancy evidence. \n(3) Section M3 : The starting point for assessing the Bank’s loss. \n(4) Section M4 : The Repayment Defence.  \n(5) Section M5 : The Use of Funds Defence. \n(6) Section M6 : Morton’s Fork - loss before or after but not during the Misappropriation. \n(7) Section M7 : Miscellaneous points on loss. \nM1 UKRAINIAN LAW EVIDENCE  \n(1) Summary \n694 The Ukrainian experts were agreed on the following basic points: \n(1) There is no “ test for the existence of a causal link between unlawful conduct and harm ” in tort \nand “ causation is established on a case-by-case basis ” (UkrJR/¶40 {C5/1/18}). As Mr \nAlyoshin puts it, “[ w]hether a causal link exists in a given situation is ultimately a question of \nfact, on which I express no opinion ”.607 Although there are variations in the authorities as \nto the appropriate vocabulary to describe the test, those differences appear largely \nsemantic; the latest formulation being whether the harm was “ an objective consequence ” \nof the unlawful conduct. In the end, Ukrainian courts plainly take a common sense \nview of causation: the unlawful conduct need not be either the ‘sole’ cause or the \n‘latest’ cause of the harm. For that reason, Ukrainian courts have no difficulty \nconcluding that different wrongdoers, either acting together or in succession, should \neach be regarded as causing harm: see Section I . \n(2) The experts agree that deprivation of money amounts to harm for the purpose of \nestablishing tortious liability: see UkrJR/¶42.1 {C5/1/19}. In the case of a \n \n607  Alyoshin1/¶256 {C2/1/93}. \n{AA2/15/360}\n{AA2/15/378}\n{AA2/15/389}\n{AA2/15/396}\n{AA2/15/410}\n{AA2/15/415}\n{AA2/15/416}\n{AA2/15/222}\nAA2/15/360\n354 misappropriation, Mr Alyoshin accepts that the harm is caused at the time when the \nclaimant is deprived of its property: see Alyoshin1/¶172 {C2/1/62}.

Assuming that \nthe other elements of tort are satisfied, liability is established at the same time. \n(3) The fact that the misappropriation occurred by the extraction of money from the Bank \ninto accounts held by Borrowers and other companies at the Bank makes no \ndifference: that is still the extraction of money (UkrJR/¶43 {C5/1/19}). \n(4) Having established that Ds’ unlawful conduct caused harm in the form of US$2.3bn \nRelevant Drawdowns misappropriated from the Bank, the next question (which is a \nquestion of fact) is: what is the quantification of the Bank’s loss? \n(5) The remedies available in tort include “ compensation for damages in full under Articles 22 \nand 1192 ”: see UkrJR/¶50.1 {C5/1/22}. Mr Beketov describes this as the principle of \nfull compensation under Art. 22(3) {C1/6/2}: see Beketov8/¶¶68-69, 106, 129 \n{C1/1/22}. Mr Alyoshin eventually agreed, moving a long way from his initial answer \nof “I don’t know what you mean by ‘full compensation ’” {Day31/132:10} - {Day31/133:2}. \n(6) The quantification of the amount needed to provide full compensation for the harm \ncaused is a question of fact: Beketov XX {Day28/140:19} - {Day28/141:2}; Alyoshin \nXX {Day31/138:5} - {Day31/139:12}. \n695 The experts have not found any Ukrainian case in which a tort claim has been brought in \nrelation to fraudulent misappropriation of monies using the mechanism of unlawful (void \nor valid) loans where either ( i) the proceeds of the fraud were used to repay earlier unlawful \nloans and/or ( ii) the unlawful loans were recorded as repaid by later fraudulent loans: see \nBeketov8/¶¶134, 137 {C1/1/43}; Beketov XX {Day27/101:5-7}. Indeed, D1 submitted in \nopening that there was no Ukrainian case that directly applies to the facts of the Bank’s \nclaim: {Day6/46:5-10}. \n696 Perhaps the closest line of authority are those cases, exemplified by Ukoopspilka,608 in which \nthe DGF made claims against senior Bank officials who had allowed their banks to enter \ninto fraudulent and ‘risky’ transactions (in that case, the purchase of junk bonds) which led \nto insolvency. As set out at [7.69]-[7.72] of the decision {C9.8/1/37} (quoted at ¶427 above), \nthe Grand Chamber found that there would, on the facts of the case, have been no point in \nthe DGF pursuing claims against the sellers of the bonds (“… filing claims against them would \nnot have positive consequences, but would only lead to additional expenses for legal fees… ”) and hence \n \n608  And see also Bank Daniel at [218] {C2/79/45}. \nAA2/15/361\n355 that even if such claims had been made they would not, on the facts of the case, mitigate the \nloss (“ … the application of the consequences of the voidness of transactions for the purchase of bonds could \nnot significantly affect the total value of the liquidation estate and be a way to correct the damage caused \n…”). The same reasoning would be applicable if the DGF had pursued restitutionary claims \nbut had failed to make a recovery or, as a matter of pragmatism, settled for costs or for a \ncent in the dollar. What is abundantly clear is that the loss for the purpose of Art. 1166 is \ndifferent from the restitutionary claims, and falls to be assessed as a matter of fact. \n697 In the absence of any specific case law, Mr Beketov identified certain first principles which \nhe believed would inform the Court in making its assessment of what sum is required to \nprovide full compensation for the harm caused. These were Art. 15 CC (protection of a \nvictim’s rights) {C1/6/1}, Art. 3(1)(6) CC (principle of"}

In contrast, the only cases cited in Mr Alyoshin’s written \nevidence (Alyoshin1/¶¶126-142 {C2/1/47}, Alyoshin2/¶¶27-48 {C7/1/11}) relate to the \nquestion of the status of a payment as a transaction: save for those cases, he accepted that \nultimately the question of harm was a question of fact. \n698 Against that background, while the Court has heard XX of the Ukrainian law experts on \nvarious hypotheticals (a process which it is fair to say generated considerable confusion), in \nthe end there was little dispute as to the legal principles which apply, and it was agreed that \nthe core assessments to be made as to harm and compensation are assessments of fact for \nthe Court. \n(2) Ukrainian law experts’ views on the Repayment Defence: Intermediary and New \nLoans \n699 The Bank’s primary case is that the Relevant Loans and ‘cover up’ loans (Intermediary and \nNew Loans) are all void: see Section J1(3)  above. \n700 That being so, the correct analysis of the harm in this case is that it is an extraction of the \nBank’s money (in the form of the Relevant Drawdowns), with the Relevant Loan documents \n(and the void contractual debts) providing the pretext for the extraction and serving to \ndisguise it. Applying Ukrainian law, the task for the Court is then to assess, as a matter of \nfact, what sum is needed to provide full compensation for the harm caused. That is where \nUkrainian law ends, and the factual assessment of the Court begins. And, as already outlined, \nthe Bank’s case is that the facts here are clear: D1-2 concealed the misappropriation with \n{AA2/15/279}\nAA2/15/362\n356 further fraudulent and void lending that provided nothing of value to the Bank and did \nnothing to reduce the Bank’s loss from the Relevant Drawdowns.  \n701 That factual assessment is unaffected by the steps to cover up the Misappropriation. In \nparticular, it is not affected by the replacement in the Bank’s loan books of one set of \npurported but void contractual debts (the Relevant Loans) with another (the Intermediary \nand New Loans). Nor is it affected by the issue of whether the restitutionary liabilities609 \nassociated with the void loans shift from one set of shell companies to another. \n702 In light of the above, the time taken in exploration of these issues with the Ukrainian law \nexperts was to a very large extent inviting them to express views on factual issues for the \nCourt, and is beside the point. However, for completeness it is addressed below. \n(a) Mr Beketov \n703 Mr Beketov’s written evidence (Beketov1/¶¶137-141 {C1/1/44}) is that, where a purported \ncontractual debt under void loan 1 is ‘repaid’ with the proceeds of further void loan 2, the \npurported repayment does not extinguish the tortious liability of the wrongdoer who \nprocured the extraction of monies under void loan 1, and the victim can elect to claim on \nthe tortious loss caused by the original extraction (subject to the limits of double recovery). \nThat was based on his application to those hypothetical facts of the first principles of \nUkrainian law. \n704 Mr Beketov’s oral evidence on this situation ( i.e. misappropriation via a void loan, followed \nby the purported repayments using proceeds of a further void loan) was the same – \nnotwithstanding an unclear and confusing series of question"}

He was asked whether, in that scenario, the bank/victim would have a restitutionary \nand/or tortious claim arising from the grant of loan 1. Mr Beketov’s answer was that \nthis was a “ matter of fact ”. In particular: “ if it may be taken as a true fact that in such way bank \ndecided that it has to be compensated, in other words that the bank is fine that it is repaid with its \nown money for this tort and there is evidence that that in fact happened, there was the will of the bank \nto do so, then I believe any lender in such situation would have difficulty to claim this loss .” \n{Day28/41:2-9}. In other words, if the victim voluntarily agrees to settle the \nrestitutionary and tort claims associated with an initial wrongful extraction of money, \nthen that might in theory defeat a claim. But there was no such voluntary settlement \nin this case (and none is or could be alleged). Indeed, Mr Howard KC and Mr Beketov \nagreed at {Day28/44:2-6} that “ it might not be a genuine choice being made if the people who \nmake the choice are the people who themselves were responsible for taking the loans ”. \n(4) There was some confusion caused by a scenario put to Mr Beketov at {Day28/23:7} ff \nwhich involved Mr Howard KC stealing US$1m from Mr Beketov with Mr Hunter \nKC’s help and then Mr Howard KC returning US$1m to Mr Beketov. It was then put \nto Mr Beketov that the claim in tort against Mr Hunter KC would be extinguished, \nwith which Mr Beketov agreed. But at no point did Mr Howard suggest that the source \nof the US$1m repaid was a further theft or void loan: that was not part of the \nhypothetical scenario put to Mr Beketov. He was simply asked whether a claim would \nlie in circumstances where a thief repaid what was stolen, and unsurprisingly expressed \nthe view that in such a case the repayment would on the facts make good the loss, as \nit would. \n(b) Mr Alyoshin \n705 Mr Alyoshin’s written evidence purported to disagree with Mr Beketov in the ‘void loan \nrepaying void loan’ case. In his reports, he asserted that if void loan 2 is used to repay void \nloan 1, then the tortious liability of the individual who procured void loan 1 is extinguished: \nAlyoshin1/¶¶134-136 {C2/1/50}; Alyoshin2/¶¶27-41 {C7/1/11}.

That evidence (which \nwas in any event offering a factual view and not a legal one) should be rejected: \n(1) Mr Alyoshin was a thoroughly unreliable witness and lacked any objectivity or \nindependence. \nAA2/15/364\n358 (2) Mr Alyoshin’s inability to grasp even the most basic of hypothetical scenarios in XX \ndemonstrated that these positions were simply arguments being advanced on behalf \nof his client that he was willing to lend his name to. Compare, for example, the \ncomplex illustration at Alyoshin2¶/34 (“ for example, if the defendant had wrongfully procured \ntwo loans from different borrowers …” etc. {C7/1/15}) with his absurd failure to \ncomprehend the basic scenarios put to him on Day 31 {Day31/105:16} ff  (see e.g. \n“How it could be transferred to company B because the transaction loan is void?...I don’t understand \nthe example ” {Day31/118:21-24}; “ At the moment Company B has $100 million, what \nCompany B was doing with this $100 million? ” {Day31/123:21-22}). \n(3) Mr Alyoshin’s inability or unwillingness to engage with the Bank’s hypotheticals put \nto him in XX can be contrasted with the prepared speeches he reeled off on the subject \nof the Repayment Defence (see e.g. {Day31/144:13-19}: “ if we have ten loans, let’s say, the \none loan was taken, then it was taken second loan… ”). While Mr Alyoshin was able to parrot \nD1’s case on the Repayment Defence in a set piece fashion, he was wholly unable to \narticulate the rationale for it or apply any rationale to a scenario for which he had not \nbeen prepared before going into the box. \n(4) His inability to rationalise his position was most apparent when he appeared to agree \nthat where a bank official borrowed US$100m pursuant to a void loan and \nsubsequently novated the liability to a shell company, it did not extinguish the \nborrower’s restitutionary liability to repay the US$100m (see Alyoshin XX \n{Day31/116:1-25}). But he simply could not explain why the result would be different \nif, instead of novating the void loan to a shell company, the bank official procured a \nsecond void loan of US$100m and used it to repay the first void loan (see \n{Day31/122:1} - {Day31/128:15}). \n(5) Mr Alyoshin referred in XX to Ukrainian cases which showed a “ consistent practice of \nUkrainian courts that sources of the funds [for repayment ] practically doesn’t matter ” \n{Day31/145:6-17}. There is no such body of cases. The only case Mr Alyoshin cites \non this point is at Alyoshin2/¶32 (a case he calls ‘Biznesrostbank’ but which is actually \ncalled Finrostbank610 {C7/15/2}). That case, which was not put to Mr Beketov, and \nis hard to follow, does not support the proposition that repayment of void loan 1 with \nthe proceeds of void loan 2 extinguishes the tortious liability of the person who \n \n610  Decision of the Odessa Commercial Court of Appeal dated 18.10.17 in Case No. 916/1475/17. \nAA2/15/365\n359 procured loan 1. Finrostbank did not concern void lending (or any void transactions \nat all). \n(6) As we explain below, Mr Alyoshin’s position is unjustifiable by reference to the \nUkrainian law principles of fairness, justice and reasonableness, and full \ncompensation.  \n706 In summary, the Relevant, Intermediary and New Loans are all clearly void for the reasons \nset out at Section J1(3) .

That being so, the analysis of the Repayment Defence is the one \nset out above and supported by Mr Beketov and first principles of Ukrainian law: it fails \nbecause further void and circular transactions undertaken to disguise the Misappropriation \nby the Relevant Drawdowns do not reduce the Bank’s loss in fact, and the Bank can elect to \nsue on the Relevant Drawdowns rather than any later (void) loans. \n(3) Ukrainian law experts’ views on the Repayment Defence: Intermediary and New \nLoans on the assumption that all loans are valid \n707 Considerable time was taken up in the XX of Mr Beketov exploring various hypotheses \ninvolving a series of valid but fraudulent loans with later loans repaying earlier. This was \ninconsequential and/or inappropriate: ( i) it is not this case: this case involves loans which \nare plainly void; ( ii) the questioning was inviting speculation on what would be (if they had \narisen which they do not) factual issues; and ( iii) the questioning was unclear, apt to confuse \nand did confuse. However, for completeness, we address this hypothetical in this section. \n708 The experts agree that if the Relevant Loans are valid, then repayment of the loan \nextinguishes the contractual liability of the borrower under that loan. In particular: ( i) Mr \nBeketov agreed that, where a valid loan is repaid, the repayment extinguishes the liability of \nthe borrower under the valid loan, and that is the case even if the source of the repayment \nis a later unlawful loan: {Day27/107:14-25};611 and ( ii) Mr Alyoshin’s evidence is that if the \nloans are valid then the repayment of those loans discharges the borrowers’ liability (which \nis agreed): Alyoshin1/¶131 {C2/1/48}.  \n709 The issue which divides the experts in this hypothetical scenario is whether contractual \nrepayment of ‘unlawful but valid’ loan 1 using funds drawn down from the same victim \nunder a later ‘unlawful but valid’ loan 2 operates to ‘extinguish’ the tortious liability of the \nindividual who procured loan 1 from the victim. In truth, that is a factual question because \n \n611  Mr Beketov repeatedly confirmed his position on this: {Day27/110:3-10}. \n{AA2/15/279}\nAA2/15/366\n360 the question is whether the loss has been compensated in that situation. However, the views \nof the experts are outlined below. \n(a) Mr Beketov \n710 Mr Beketov’s written evidence on this was as follows: \n(1) In relation to void loans: “ where monies purportedly used to repay an unlawful loan (‘loan 1’) \nare themselves referrable to other, unlawful lending (‘loan 2’), then the purported repayment of loan 1 \nwould not operate to reduce the lender’s loss caused by loan 1, for which the lender would remain \nentitled to be fully compensated ” and the victim could elect which of the two tortious claims \nto sue upon (Beketov8/¶¶137-141 {C1/1/44}); \n(2) He would reach the same conclusion if loan 1 and loan 2 (in the example above) were \nvalid rather than void. “ in this scenario, there would be an earlier misappropriation and a later \nmisappropriation, both of which involved unlawful (and tortious) conduct and both of which caused \nloss in the amount of the funds misappropriated less any genuine recovery by the victim. In that \nscenario, the victim could sue in respect of either misappropriation, but would not be permitted to \nrecover in respect of both ” (Beketov8/¶200(b) {C6/1/82}.  \n711 In XX, Mr Beketov initially confirmed his views on these points as set out in UkrJR/¶46.1 \n{C5/1/20} and then again in exchanges with Mr Howard KC: see {Day27/99:10} - \n{Day27/104:20}.

In particular:  \n“Q.…So your view is, even though the loan, the first loan, is repaid, the lender still has a claim \nin tort in relation to that loan; is that right? \nA. Yes, if the first loan is repaid with source - -  with claimant’s own sources, then there will \nbe a claim in the first tort. {Day27/101:22} - {Day27/102:3} \n… \nQ. Right. Let me just see if I understand this. Where the loans --  the first loan is unlawful and \nhas given rise  to a claim in tort and it’s repaid by a second loan,  which is also unlawful, you \nsay these first principles apply so that the repayment out of the proceeds of the second loan \ndo not serve to reduce the loss in tort suffered by reason of the first loan; correct? \nA. These principles apply to the right of the claimant to  sue defendant on whatever tort the \nclaimant considers  appropriate. {Day27/103:9-16} \n… \nQ.…Now, the next thing I want to get clear: so, in that circumstance, whether or not the \nloans are void doesn’t matter, does it? It’s sufficient for your analysis that each of the loans \nwas granted in circumstances which were unlawful and so gave rise to a claim in tort; correct? \nA. Correct. \nQ. Right. That’s helpful. So the debate about whether  things are void or not may not \nmatter…” {Day27/104:12-21} \n712 Thereafter, however, Mr Beketov appeared to reverse the evidence he had given moments \nearlier that where loan 1 and loan 2 are both unlawful but valid, repayment of loan 1 with \nAA2/15/367\n361 the proceeds of loan 2 extinguished the tortious liability of anyone involved in arranging \nloan 1. See {Day27/110:21} - {Day27/112:22}: \n“Q. …The first loan is valid but wrongful -- okay? \nA. Okay. \nQ. repaid out of a second loan which is also wrongful.  Now, taking the first loan, if that was \na valid loan and a payment is made in respect of the borrower’s liability, as I understand it, \nyou say the borrower’s liability is extinguished; correct? \nA. Yes. \nQ. And do you also say, because the borrower’s liability is extinguished, in other words he has \nrepaid his money, then the wrongdoers who arranged the loan to that borrower, they also \nhave extinguished their liability because the borrower’s liability has been extinguished and so \nthere is no further loss that the bank suffers; is that right? \nA. I think on propositions that the first loan is valid, it is right. \nQ. Right. \nA. Under Ukrainian law we do not have wrong or imprudent debts, we have only valid or void \ncontractual obligations. \nQ. Right. Let me see if I can understand where we have got to. If the original loan is -- let’s \nassume the original loan is taken out in circumstances which  involve breaches of duty by \npeople within the bank but it is still a valid loan to the borrower - -  \nA. Yes. \nQ. - -  and subsequent loans are taken out which result in monies being drawn down which \nare used to repay this original loan, in that circumstance - -  because you say if the original loan \nis valid , then the subsequent  repayments have both extinguished the liability of the borrower \nand any liability of any wrongdoers in tort; correct? \nA. Yes, I believe that is possible. \nQ. Right. So, as I understand it, therefore, what this means on your evidence is actually where \nwe are looking  at repayment of an earlier --  of one loan being repaid  by a drawdown under \nanother, on your evidence the  critical question is whether the loan being repaid was  void or \nnot because, if it’s not void, in other words  it’s valid, then you accept the repayment works, \nbut if it’s void, you say it doesn’t? \nA. Yes. \nQ. Okay. When I say ‘works’, it works both to extinguish  the liability of the borrower and the \nliability of the  tortfeasor? \nA. "}
{"start": 1008000, "text": " your evidence is actually where \nwe are looking  at repayment of an earlier --  of one loan being repaid  by a drawdown under \nanother, on your evidence the  critical question is whether the loan being repaid was  void or \nnot because, if it’s not void, in other words  it’s valid, then you accept the repayment works, \nbut if it’s void, you say it doesn’t? \nA.

Yes, because on competition of claim issue, repayment of this valid contract would prevent \nclaim in tort for the first borrower.” \n713 It is important to see the limited reasoning Mr Beketov gave for agreeing with the \npropositions put to him, which were directly contrary to the evidence he had confirmed a \nfew minutes earlier. In particular, while he appeared to agree that repayment of loan 1 using \nthe proceeds of loan 2 would extinguish the tortious liability of anyone involved in arranging \nloan 1, he explained this on the basis of “ competition of claims issue, repayment of this valid contract \nwould prevent claim in tort for the first borrower ”. It appeared from this non sequitur  that Mr Beketov \nthought he was commenting on tortious claims against the borrower. That was not the \nsubject of any follow-up questioning on Day 27. However, when Mr Howard KC returned \nAA2/15/368\n362 to the subject on Day 28 he read part of the transcript back to Mr Beketov {Day28/17:6} ff \nand Mr Beketov clarified his answers as follows:  \n“Q.…So what we also agree is that, if the borrower’s  liability in respect of a valid loan is \nrepaid and is  extinguished, then any liability of third parties in  tort in relation to that loan is \nalso extinguished;  correct? \nA. I took it not as liability of third parties. I saw it as liability of borrower, particular \ncounterparty,  because, as far as I said, that liability would be extinguished also because such \ncounterparty to valid  loan would not be able to make a tort claim. \nQ. Well, wait a minute. Just look at the question you were  agreeing with. Line 6: “And do you \nalso say, because the borrower’s  liability is extinguished, in other words he has repaid  his \nmoney, then the wrongdoers who arranged the loan to that borrower, they also have \nextinguished their liability because the borrower’s liability has been extinguished and so there \nis no further loss that the bank suffers ... ”  And you agreed; correct? \nA. I think in that respect it may be agreed that, you know,  there was no further loan - -  loss \nthat the bank suffered  and in this respect, yes, even though the bank would  have ability to \nfile a tort claim against third parties,  but their liability would be extinguished by repayment  \nof this valid loan.” {Day28/18:4} - {Day28/18:4}.  \n714 By this point Mr Beketov’s evidence had become confused although, read as a whole, it is \nclear that he drew a clear distinction for cases where the purported repayment came from \nthe victim’s own money (see “ there was no further loan - - loss that the bank suffered… ”). Again, \nhis answers were not the subject of clarification in XX. It ought to have been obvious from \nthat point, if it was not already, that the evidential value of Mr Beketov’s answers to \nhypothetical questions would be extremely limited unless the question, and Mr Beketov, \nwere clear as to three matters: \n(1) The source of the repayment of the valid loan: Mr Beketov repeatedly said that the \n“source of repayment…it’s very important ” {Day28/37:11} and his answer to different \nhypotheticals depended upon whether the source of repayment was “ victim’s own \nresources ” {Day28/29:7}, {Day28/26:1-13}, {Day28/38:21-22}. \n(2) The nature of the tort claim and the identity of the putative tortfeasor: Mr Beketov \nwas evidently unclear about whether the tort claim which was said to be extinguished \nupon repayment of loan 1 was a tort claim against the borrower, or an officer of the \nborrower ("}
{"start": 1011500, "text": "“source of repayment…it’s very important ” {Day28/37:11} and his answer to different \nhypotheticals depended upon whether the source of repayment was “ victim’s own \nresources ” {Day28/29:7}, {Day28/26:1-13}, {Day28/38:21-22}. \n(2) The nature of the tort claim and the identity of the putative tortfeasor: Mr Beketov \nwas evidently unclear about whether the tort claim which was said to be extinguished \nupon repayment of loan 1 was a tort claim against the borrower, or an officer of the \nborrower (see below), or some other third party. \n(3) The connection between loan 1 and loan 2 and whether the tortfeasor who arranged \nloan 1 was also responsible for unlawfully (and tortiously) procuring loan 2. \n715 Mr Beketov’s difficulties in following these hypotheticals were demonstrated in re-\nexamination, where he initially thought that the scenario posited by Mr Hunter KC involved \na potential tortious conduct by an “ officer of the borrower ” rather than an officer of the bank \n{Day29/99:20} - {Day29/100:1}. Nevertheless, once Mr Beketov understood all elements \nAA2/15/369\n363 of the hypothetical, his answer was clear. Where an officer of a bank procures a valid but \nunlawful loan 1 to borrower 1 and later procures a valid but unlawful loan 2 to borrower 2 \nand uses the latter to repay the former as part of a single scheme, the repayment extinguishes \nborrower 1’s contractual liability under loan 1, but not the officer’s tortious liability in respect \nof loan 1, and the bank can elect to sue on either tort: \n“No, I believe it still may be a claim in respect of  tort 1 and tort 2 because, as it is in my \nevidence, actually in the situation where actually two consecutive  torts are committed against \nthe same person, with money  of this person, according to general principles of  Ukrainian law \nin the first place, Article 15 of the  Civil Code, Article 316, Article 1192, the person  had a \nright to decide on which tort to sue.” {Day29/105:4-11} \n716 Furthermore, Mr Beketov’s position in re-examination was that his evidence in XX was \nconsistent with the evidence in his reports: {Day29/94:16} - {Day29/98:14}. Mr Howard \nKC criticised Mr Beketov’s re-examination as “ plainly inappropriate ”. That criticism is \nunwarranted: ( i) the re-examination was on a subject which Mr Howard KC had raised with \nMr Beketov in a series of ambiguous hypotheticals which it was patently clear the witness \nhad not fully understood; and ( ii) it was open to Mr Beketov to say in re-examination that, \nin light of the hypotheticals which had been put to him by Mr Howard KC, his views had \nchanged since his report (Mr Howard KC did not give Mr Beketov the chance to comment \non his written evidence: see {Day28/45:24} - {Day28/46:2}). \n717 The Court should therefore conclude that Mr Beketov’s opinion is as set out in his written \nevidence and summarised in re-examination as quoted above.612  \n(b) Mr Alyoshin \n718 Mr Alyoshin’s evidence on the valid loan repaying valid loan hypothetical – unsurprisingly – \nwas that his client’s liability was extinguished. He asserted in writing that repayment of the \nloan operates to extinguish any tortious liability on the part of the individual who procured \nthe loan: see Alyoshin1/¶¶135-136 {C2/1/50}. To the extent that any reasoning was given \nfor this it is not really based on Ukrainian law at all. Moreover, his argument was premised \non the assertion that the Bank’s loss for the purpose of a claim in Article 1166 is coterminous \nwith the contractual liability under the valid loan (see esp. Alyoshin1/¶¶136, 138-142 \n{C2/1/51}). But that is clearly not right: the contractual liability of the borrower may be \nextinguished without the lender receiving full compensation for the tortious loss. For the \n \n612  Accordingly – and consistently with how D1 opened the case (see D1 Opening/¶135 {AA3/1/45}) – the \nefficacy of the Repayment Defence does not in fact turn on whether the Relevant Loans are valid or void \n(although they are clea"}

That is an extraordinary proposition which (unsurprisingly) has no basis in Ukrainian \nlaw.  \n(a) The Asset Transfer – recap \n720 A quick recap of the salient facts is appropriate as a reminder of the context for the evidence \nfrom the Ukrainian law experts on this aspect:  \n(1) D1-2 procured the transfer of some of their OSFs, Petrol Stations, Real Estate and \nAircraft. \n(2) The mechanism by which D1-2’s assets were transferred to the Bank was that each \nasset was the subject of a Mortgage between the Bank and the Asset Transferor; the \nCredit Value of the asset was recorded in the Mortgage along with the loans secured \nby the Mortgage; within days of the Mortgage being entered into, the Bank enforced \nthe Mortgage; and the value of the asset was applied to reduce the outstanding balance \non the secured loans. Reply/¶27F.4 {A1/25/40}. That process was controlled by D1-\n2 and their lieutenants at the Bank (including Novikov and BOK employees), \nPrimecap and PBC: see Bank Opening/¶¶388-391 {AA2/1/162} and Section H2 \n(¶347 ff).  \n(3) The Credit Values were based on the 2016 Valuation Reports. The Credit Values vastly \nexceeded the true values of the Transferred Assets: see Section N . \n(4) D1-2 knew that the Credit Values were fraudulently inflated, and it was D1-2 who \nprocured the Relevant Loan balances to be reduced in the Bank’s books by reference \nto the fraudulently inflated Credit Values: see Section H2(3) (¶357 ff). \n(5) In 2018, the Bank re-stated its 2016 balance sheet. That included re-stating the value \nof the Transferred Assets at a fraction of their Credit Values.613  \n \n613  See Bezant-Assets1/Table 3-2 {D19/1/36} \n{AA2/15/207}\n{AA2/15/422}\n\u0003\n{AA2/15/215}\nAA2/15/371\n365 721 D1-2’s case that the Relevant Drawdowns were repaid by the Transferred Assets requires \nthe Court to accept that ( i) the Bank was fully compensated for its loss by reference to the \nCredit Values, even though it is common ground they were inflated; and/or ( ii) the Bank is \nbound by the Credit Values notwithstanding that those values were fraudulently inflated by \nD1-2. \n(b) Ukrainian law: the Credit Values and full compensation \n722 The key question is whether the Bank’s loss is reduced by reference to an inflated value \nincluded in a mortgage agreement and later applied to reduce the outstanding loan balance.  \n(i) Mr Beketov \n723 Mr Beketov’s evidence was that if a loan secured by a mortgage is void then the mortgage is \nalso void, evidence with which Mr Alyoshin broadly agreed: Alyoshin3/¶6 {C9.1/1/5}. The \nBank is not fully compensated for its loss by reference to a fraudulently inflated valuation of \nthe asset, but only by the true value of the asset: UkrJR/¶55.1 {C5/1/23}; Beketov8/¶¶146-\n150 {C1/1/48}; Beketov 11/¶¶33-36 {C9.2/1/12}.

Indeed, it is common ground between \nthe experts that if the mortgage is void, the Bank will not be bound by any value appearing \non the face of the mortgage: UkrJR/¶¶51{C5/1/22}.  \n724 It is also common ground that if the mortgage is void there is a prima facie  obligation on the \nparties to give restitution of any property transferred under it: UkrJR/¶52.2 {C5/1/22}; \nD1Def/¶41(10) {A1/8/24}. But that does not assist D1-2: \n(1) As Mr Beketov explains, if D1-2 procured the fraudulent inflation of the assets’ values \nin order to conceal the losses they had caused to the Bank, then D1-2’s (and the Asset \nTransferors’) prima facie  right to restitution of the Transferred Assets from the Bank \nwould be refused as an abuse of rights contrary to Art. 13(2)-(3) CC. In short, the \nBank is entitled to retain the Transferred Assets provided it credits them at their true \nvalue: Beketov8/¶¶144-145 {C1/1/47}; Beketov XX {Day28/53:11-21} (not \nchallenged). \n(2) There can be no basis on which D1-2, who owned and controlled the Transferred \nAssets, can simultaneously claim credit for the value of those assets in these \nproceedings (on the basis that the assets were transferred to the Bank) and claim that \nthey are entitled to restitution of those same assets.  \n(3) Further and in any event, if the court finds that the Mortgages are invalid and that the \nBank is obliged to give restitution of those assets to the Asset Transferors, it will \nAA2/15/372\n366 inevitably follow that the Bank’s loss in these proceedings cannot be reduced by \nreference to the value of those assets because, ex hypothesi , each asset received by the \nBank is matched with a corresponding liability in restitution ( i.e. the Bank’s net gain \nfrom the assets is nil): Reply/¶27F.10 {A1/25/42}. \n725 In XX, Mr Beketov agreed that the Bank could choose to treat the asset as worth its inflated \nvalue and, if it did so, the borrower’s liability (in restitution) and the tortious liability of \nanyone who arranged the loan would be extinguished: Beketov XX {Day28/57:21} - \n{Day28/58:23}. No attempt was made to explore with Mr Beketov how that choice might \nbe made. It is clear from Mr Beketov’s later evidence on the application of the VCFP \nprinciple that the choice had to be a free one and could not be made by the fraudsters \nthemselves. \n726 Mr Beketov also considers that if the loan and mortgage are valid, but the asset’s value \nrecorded in the mortgage is inflated, the Bank’s loss resulting from the loan should only be \nreduced by reference to the true value of the asset: see UkrJR/¶55.1 {C5/1/23}; \nBeketov8/¶¶151-160 {C1/1/49}. While Mr Beketov agreed that “ it’s a basic principle of \nUkrainian law ” that a borrower’s liability under a valid loan is extinguished when a bank \ncredits the borrower’s account with the value of an asset {Day28/49:16} - {Day28/50:17}, \nthe question was not set up on the premise that that the value of the asset recorded in the \nmortgage was fraudulently inflated. He clarified in re-examination that if the fraudster had \ninflated the value of the asset in the mortgage: “ what the bank can do is, for the assessment of loss, \nit could validly say that the mortgagor who, as I understand, at the same time is a fraudster, in such case, \ncannot rely on value of the underlying mortgage agreement even though this mortgage agreement is valid because \nit would be - - again, if this was all in the context of committing fraud against the bank, it would be an \nabuse of right for mortgagor in such case to rely on provisions of mortgage agreement ” {Day29/108:19} - \n"}

His evidence is that the Bank is bound by the values even \nAA2/15/373\n367 if they were fraudulently inflated and the fraudsters then sought to rely on those \ninflated values to reduce the compensation they had to pay to the Bank: {Day32/2:23} \n- {Day31/3:13}. \n728 Mr Alyoshin also belatedly suggested that, if a mortgage is invalid only in part, valuations \nwithin it nevertheless remain binding: Alyoshin3/¶6 {C9.1/1/5}. However, as Mr Beketov \npoints out, if the mortgage is itself invalid in part, then “ any such contractual valuation would not \nbe binding in relation to those secured loan obligations that are invalid ”: Beketov11/¶36(a) \n{C9.2/1/12}. It follows that  Mr Alyoshin’s self-serving afterthought should be rejected: the \ntrue value of the assets should be used to quantify the Bank’s loss: Beketov11/¶36 \n{C9.2/1/12}. \n(c) Summary \n729 Accordingly, if the Bank is correct that on the facts of this case the loans are void, then there \nis no dispute that the mortgages are void and it is agreed that the Bank is not bound by the \nfraudulently inflated values contained in the Mortgages. \n730 Even if the loans and Mortgages had been valid, there is a dispute between the experts as to \nwhether the Bank is bound by the fraudulent valuations. But Mr Beketov’s view about that \nis plainly right: it would be absurd – and an abuse of rights contrary to Art. 13(2)-(3) CC, the \nprinciples of justice, good faith and reasonableness, and the principle full compensation \n(Reply/¶27F.7 {A1/25/41}) – if the fraudsters could steal money from the Bank and then \ncontend that the Bank suffered no loss because they mortgaged an asset to the Bank the \nvalue of which was fraudulently inflated for the very purpose of giving the false impression \nthat the loss was extinguished. \n731 Standing back, the proposition that the Bank is fully compensated for a loss of US$100m if \nit receives an asset worth only US$10m is simply unreal regardless of whether the underlying \nagreements are valid or void. It is even more unreal once one adds in the fact that the \novervaluations were procured by the fraudsters themselves. Ukrainian law requires the Court \nto identify the real harm to the Bank and to establish what amount of money is full \ncompensation for that harm. In order to do that, the true values must be used and the \nfraudulent false ones ignored. \n(d) Ukrainian law:  does the VCFP principle somehow bind the Bank to false Credit \nValues? \n732 D1-2 argue that the Bank should be bound by the Credit Values even though the Transferred \nAssets did not fully compensate it for its loss.

Briefly: \n(1) D1-2 do not plead a case that the Bank has acted inconsistently in its treatment of the \nassets’ Credit Values.615 \n(2) The Bank cannot be bound by the VCFP principle by pre-nationalisation conduct \nwhich was, in substance, conduct of D1-2: Beketov9/¶214 {C6/1/89}.  \n(3) There is no evidence that D1-2 reasonably relied to their detriment on the Bank’s \nacceptance of the assets at their Credit Values. The Bank has agreed that its loss is \nreduced by reference to the assets’ true values. In those circumstances, it is impossible \nto see how the VCFP principle can be engaged. \n(4) Since nationalisation the Bank has acted in good faith in retaining or selling the assets \nwith a view to mitigating the loss caused by D1-2’s conduct. \n(5) If the Relevant and Intermediary Loans are void then the Mortgages are also void, and \nthe VCFP principle does not apply to void transactions.616 \n733 During Mr Beketov’s XX, it appeared D1 was setting up an unpleaded case that the Bank \nhad elected to accept the assets at their inflated values and was somehow bound by that \nelection (see  e.g. {Day28/58:13-23}). As to that:  \n(1) D1-2 have not pleaded a case to that effect. Nor did D1-2 put it to Ms Pakhachuk or \nMr Oleksiyenko that the Bank had elected to retain the assets (and to accept their \nCredit Values irrespective of their obvious inflation) and it was somehow bound by \nthat election.  \n(2) It cannot be the case that the Bank is bound by a supposed election made while it was \nunder the control of D1-2. That would constitute a flagrant abuse of rights. \n(3) It is simply not the case that the Bank has continued to treat the assets at their Credit \nValues. The Bank’s 2016 financial statements were qualified by the Bank’s auditors on \nthe basis that “ we were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence in respect of the fair \nvalue of the repossessed properties ” {K1/6/4}. In 2018-19, the Bank had the Transferred \n \n614  Alyoshin1/¶148 {C2/1/54}; UkrJR/¶53.2 {C5/1/22}. \n615  D1 pleads a case based on VCFP in respect of the Bank’s treatment of the Relevant, Intermediary and New \nLoans, but not in respect of the Mortgages: D1Def/¶88(1) {A1/8/53}. \n616  The validity or invalidity of an agreement is unaffected by its performance – the fact that the Bank accepted \nthe Transferred Assets onto its balance sheet and subsequently sold or leased those assets does not render the \nMortgages valid: Beketov8/¶169 {C1/1/55}. \n{AA2/15/340}\nAA2/15/375\n369 Assets (or most of them) revalued for the purpose of restating its 2016 balance sheet. \nThose revaluations resulted in massive reductions in the value of the Transferred \nAssets recorded in the Bank’s 2016 restated balance sheet (see e.g Bezant1/¶2.1 \n{D19/1/14}; Bank’s 2016 FS Note 3 {K1/6.3/38}). \n(4) In any event, the Bank’s position has been clear in these proceedings that the \nTransferred Assets’ Credit Values were fraudulently inflated, but it will give credit for \ntheir true values against the loss caused by D1-2. \n734 Finally (and regardless of whether the Mortgages are valid or invalid): ( i) D1-2 procured the \ndeliberate inflation of the assets’ values: it would be an abuse of rights contrary to Art. 13(2)-\n(3) CC to permit D1-2 to rely on the Credit Values in those circumstances; ( ii) pursuant to \nResolutions 23 and 351, the Bank is required to treat any asset mortgaged in its favour at \nthat asset’s true value, irrespective of the value attributed to it on the face of the mortgage \nagreement; and ( iii) it would be contrary to the principles of fairness, justice and \nreasonableness for the Bank to be bound by the inflated Credit Values when determining its \nloss: Reply/¶¶27F.7.2-27F.2.3 {A1/25/39}; Beketov8/¶"}

OB’s view is that, on an application of first principles (in particular the principles of full \ncompensation for tortious loss, justice fairness and reasonableness, and consistent with the \napproach of the English courts in National Bank Trust v Yurov [2020] EWHC 100) the Bank’s \nclaim for tortious loss caused by the Relevant Loan should be unaffected by such repayment. \nIt would be obviously wrong if a fraudster could steal from a bank to repay his own \nindebtedness and then claim the bank suffered no loss as a result of his theft (paras. 128-136 \nOB);  \n45.2. OA agrees that, in principle, the Bank’s loss caused by non-repayment of Relevant Loans \nwould not be reduced in these circumstances. However, if (contrary to his view) a claim in \ntort arises in respect of a Relevant Loan which has been repaid (see para. 46 below) then the \nuse to which the Relevant Loan has been put would also need to be taken into account in \nassessing the Bank’s loss.”  \n736 Mr Beketov’s view is clear:  \n(1) “if A lawfully borrows €100 from B, but a week later steals €100 from B’s wallet which he then \ngives to B to repay his loan, B has still suffered a loss in the amount of €100 as a result of A’s \nunlawful conduct ”; \nAA2/15/376\n370 (2) “it makes no difference to my analysis if A used the €100 that it stole from B’s wallet to repay an \nearlier loan advanced by B to a third party C ”: Beketov8/¶¶130, 133 {C1/1/43}; and \n(3) Mr Beketov’s view on the Use of Funds Defence was not challenged in XX.  \n737 As set out in the Joint Report, Mr Alyoshin agrees that, as a matter of principle, the use to \nwhich stolen money is put does not reduce the Bank’s loss caused by the theft. Further, he \naccepts that “ the analysis in  [NBT v Yurov] is compelling and supports Mr Beketov’s opinion (which I \nagree with) that the use to which any Relevant Loans were put is not relevant when determining the amount \nof loss caused by the Relevant Loans ”: Alyoshin2/¶¶35, 44-45 {C7/1/15}. He confirmed those \nviews in XX: {Day31/140:12} - {Day31/141:17}. \n738 In his written evidence, Mr Alyoshin went on to suggest that if the Repayment Defence fails, \nthe Use of Funds Defence should be resuscitated “ otherwise there would be scope for problems of \ndouble recovery and/or unjust enrichment… ”: Alyoshin2/¶46 {C7/1/19}. His position in this \nregard is extraordinary: if the Use of Funds Defence is bad in law, it does not become good \nin law simply because another of Ds’ defences is rejected. In XX, Mr Alyoshin could not \neven begin to articulate why his view on this point was right: {Day31/141:25} - \n{Day31/143:4}. We address this ‘Morton’s Fork’ argument below. \n739 Mr Beketov and Mr Alyoshin have both accepted that the position described in NBT v \nYurov at [1193] {M1/22/370} is logical and reasonable and would be likely to be followed \nby the Ukrainian courts: \n“1193.

As the Bank points out, the Shareholders’ argument involves the acceptance of the \nproposition that a fraudster could steal from the Bank to repay his own indebtedness and then \nclaim that the Bank has suffered no loss as a result of his theft – such an argument is obviously \n(and demonstrably) wrong as can be illustrated by adapting the Shareholders’ own examples. \nIn this regard, assume that that the Bank has a non-performing loan to Borrower A of £1,000; \nand that A is an individual who is entirely and irretrievably unable to pay, so that the Bank has \nprovisioned the loan as to 100%. On the Shareholders’ premises, this represents an actual, \nincurred loss to the Bank of £1,000. Now assume that A successfully deceives the Bank into \nhanding over to him £1,000 in cash, which A uses (as he planned all along) to settle his original \ndebt. When the Bank discovers the fraud and sues him, A’s defence (like the Shareholders’ in \nthis case) is that the Bank has suffered no loss because it had already lost £1,000; and its loss \nremains the same after the fraud. That cannot be right. The position would be no different if \nthe fraudster was a different individual, B, who dishonestly obtained the money and passed it \nto A (whether as a conspirator or a benevolent bystander) so that he could repay his debt.” \n740 The same point is made succinctly and eloquently in Komercni Bank at [171] {M1/9/21}, \nconsidered further below: \n“Consider next the position if the fraudster decides to use the proceeds of his fraud to \ndischarge a liability owed to the bank by a third party. I reject the argument that he would be \nentitled to have that matter taken into account as a relevant benefit to the bank when \ncalculating the loss resulting from his fraud. As before, his use of the funds would be the result \nAA2/15/377\n371 of his independent choice how to use the opportunity created by his fraud. Just as it would be \nwrong that a customer who could not repay his overdraft should be able to pay off the \noverdraft with funds obtained from the bank by deceit, and then defeat the bank’s claim for \ndeceit by saying that there had been no loss from his deceit (since the money obtained from \nit had been used to repay a debt that he could not have otherwise have paid), so also it would \nbe wrong that a similar result should be achieved by a customer and an accomplice - as would \nbe the case if the accomplice were able to obtain money from the bank by fraud, use it to \ndischarge the customer’s indebtedness and then defeat the bank’s action in deceit by the plea \nthat there had been no loss.” \n741 Accordingly, for all the time Ds have ploughed into showing “ what actually happened ” to the \nRelevant Drawdowns (without explaining any sort of commercial rationale), the Use of \nFunds Defence is bad in law and must fail. \nM2 THE FORENSIC ACCOUNTANCY EVIDENCE  \n742 This section addresses ( i) the scope and limitations of the forensic accountancy exercises, \n(ii) the relevance of their evidence to the issues the Court has to decide, ( iii) the different \nmethodologies used by the accountants, and ( iv) the forensic accountants’ evidence. \n(1) Scope and limitations of the forensic accountancy evidence \n743 The 1st CMC Order granted the parties permission to call expert forensic accountancy \nevidence on three issues {A6/46/4}: ( i) the accuracy and completeness of the Bank’s case; \n(ii) the accuracy and completeness of D1’s tracing exercise (which was at that time based on \nthe Lafferty Spreadsheets, abandoned soon after Mr Thompson thoroughly discredited them \nin his first report); and ( iii) the loss alleged to have been suffered by the Bank.

As the Court \nobserved on Day 24, the latter issue – the “ loss alleged to have been suffered by the Bank ” – did \nnot give the experts free reign to give their views on the legal question of loss {Day24/64:16-\n21}.617 Nor was it expressed as requiring the experts to give a view on “ accounting loss ” (which \nare not the words used). It was directed primarily at Ds’ Repayment Defence.618 \n744 Turning to the work the accountants carried out: \n(1) Mr Thompson is the only expert who was instructed to consider those three issues. \nIn his first report {D1/1}, he considered ( i) the accuracy and completeness of the \nBank’s causation analysis (Section 3); ( ii) the Lafferty Spreadsheets (Section 5); and ( iii) \nthe loss to the Bank (Section 4 (repayment defence), Section 7). He also explained in \n \n617  Mr Thompson was questioned on the false premise that he was instructed to give a “ full and fair view of the \ntransactions that the court has to think about ” (CMKC {Day24/39:2-4}). None of the forensic accountancy experts \nin the case had a roving commission to examine the Bank’s transactional data. \n618  “[ T]he forensic accountants will on each side be seeking to analyse patterns of loans and repayments, or purported repayments, \ndepending on which side of the case you are on, and going into further detail in relation to asset transfers, how they are reflected, \nwhether they can be attributed to loans, whether it is proper to attribute them to loans and so on ” (Mann J at [2] \n{A5/12.01/10}). See too Maling4/¶47 {H3/5/12}; MHKC 1st CMC transcript p.124:10-21 {G3/25/32}. \nAA2/15/378\n372 detail the difference between the Bank’s Methodology and D1’s tracing exercise (see \nSection 6 {D1/1/268}) and the onward payment of the Unreturned Prepayments \n(Section 8). \n(2) Mr Davidson was not instructed to consider issue ( i) (the accuracy and completeness \nof the Bank’s case). He was instructed to consider issue ( ii) but only on terms that the \nLafferty Spreadsheets were abandoned, and that he should conduct his own tracing \nexercise – which was then pleaded by D1 some five months after Davidson1 was filed. \nHe was also instructed to consider issue ( iii) (loss). \n(3) Mr Steadman was not instructed to consider issues ( i) or ( ii) (Steadman1/¶1.2.3 \n{D3/1/7}). It appears he was asked to consider some issues relating to the Bank’s \n“accounting ” loss in his first report. For his third report, he was belatedly instructed to \nconsider the tracing methodologies for the first time, and did so over six pages: \n{D3/13/4}. \n(2) Relevance of the forensic accountancy evidence \n745 Next, we seek to explain the relevance of the forensic accountancy evidence and the areas \nof agreement and disagreement between the accountancy experts which actually matter. \n746 The Repayment Defence. The experts agree that, except for the drawdowns made by two \nBorrowers (Tamersa and Prominmet), all of the Relevant Drawdowns are recorded in the \nBank’s transactional data as repaid. The direct sources of purported repayments are agreed. \nThe experts also agree on the ultimate sources of repayment if the Bank’s Methodology or \nExact Matching are applied. The difference between the application of the two \nmethodologies for the Repayment Defence is very limited: the Relevant Drawdowns were \nultimately ‘repaid’ primarily by the Transformation ( i.e. New Loans), Asset Transfer, and \nRelevant Drawdowns repaid by Relevant Drawdowns: AccountancyJR2/¶4.1 {D4/2/10}; \nDavidson XX {Day25/91:21} - {Day25/94:12}.  \n747 Use of Funds: Funds Flow / Bridging Loans.

The experts agree on the value of Relevant \nDrawdowns that can be traced to repayments of various other liabilities using ( i) the Funds \nFlow methodology, ( ii) Bridging Loan methodology and ( iii) a combination of both: \nAccountancyJR2/¶3.1.1 {D4/2/8}. \n748 Methodologies. The experts have employed different methodologies. They have done so for \ndifferent purposes (see MHKC {Day23/44:4-12}; Thompson XX {Day23/101:16} - \n{Day23/102:9}; Davidson2/¶2.33 {D2/11/18}; Davidson XX {Day25/28:14-17}). Thus: \nAA2/15/379\n373 (1) The Bank’s Methodology is primarily relevant to the Bank’s case that the Relevant \nDrawdowns caused the Unreturned Prepayments (see Davidson2/¶5.40 \n{D2/11/55}, Davidson XX {Day25/25:16} - {Day25/26:2}). Whether that is right \nis ultimately only relevant to the unjust enrichment claim against D3-8. \n(2) The Bank’s tort claim against D1-2 does not depend on showing that the Relevant \nDrawdowns caused the Unreturned Prepayments. That point is agreed: see D2 \nOpening/¶20 {AA4/1/10}; D1 Opening/¶¶85-86 {AA3/1/29}; Davidson3/¶2.4 \n{D2/20/17}. \n(3) As set out above, Mr Thompson has applied the Bank’s Methodology to determine \nthe ultimate sources of repayment of the Relevant Drawdowns. But he has also \nconducted that analysis on different bases (Funds Flow/Exact Matching and FIFO \n(also called the Alternative Methodology): see Thompson1/¶¶4.72-4.73 {D1/1/135}) \nand by applying Pro Rata rather than FIFO (see Thompson2/¶4.27 {D1/347/33}). \nThe differences between these three approaches are immaterial. \n(4) The primary reason why methodologies remain relevant to the Bank’s tort claim is \nthat if it were necessary to identify Relevant Drawdown Portions ( “RDPs” ) to \ncalculate the Bank’s loss, they can only be identified using the Bank’s Methodology. \nThere is then an issue whether the analysis of the repayment of RDPs should also be \napproached using the Bank’s Methodology, or whether it is appropriate to apply Funds \nFlow / Exact Matching to the process of identifying direct and ultimate sources of \nrepayment of RDPs. See below. \n(5) Put bluntly, and notwithstanding the effort expended, the methodological differences \nare of limited continuing relevance. We also address them below.  \n749 Relevant Drawdowns v RDPs: Whether the starting point for the assessment of the Bank’s \nloss is Relevant Drawdowns or RDPs is primarily a pleading question (as D1 appears to \naccept: see D1 Opening/¶425 {AA3/1/130}). The accountancy evidence is relevant to the \nquestion whether, if it were appropriate to use RDPs as the starting point for assessing loss, \nit would be appropriate to apply a Funds Flow / Exact Matching methodology (in addition \nto using the Bank’s Methodology to identify RDPs) to the Repayment Defence. \n750 Currency. The experts have also expressed their views on currency issues raised in \nDavidson3. As explained in Section O below, the differences between the experts narrowed \nconsiderably in XX as Mr Davidson was ultimately forced to agree that “ the only sensible way \n{AA2/15/491}\nAA2/15/380\n374 of calculating loss on the dollar loans is in dollars ” {Day25/150:7-10}. The currency in which the \nBank experienced its loss is ultimately a largely factual question for the Court. \n751 Loss. The experts have expressed their views on various matters which might loosely be said \nto relate to the loss suffered by the Bank, including ( i) the Bank’s financial statements, ( ii) \n“indicia of misappropriation ”, and ( iii) the Gurieva Spreadsheet and "}

The experts have expressed their views on various matters which might loosely be said \nto relate to the loss suffered by the Bank, including ( i) the Bank’s financial statements, ( ii) \n“indicia of misappropriation ”, and ( iii) the Gurieva Spreadsheet and Kazantsev Spreadsheet . \nThese matters are addressed below. \n(3) The Bank’s Methodology and the Exact Matching methodology \n752 The Bank’s Methodology uses supply agreement references in the transactional data to link \nprepayments and returns of prepayments between Borrowers and Suppliers in preference to \nExact Matching. Where money is paid by a Borrower to a Supplier as a prepayment, the \nBank’s Methodology does not seek to follow those funds, nor does it depend upon the \nSupplier holding those same funds for 90 days before the subsequent return of prepayment \nis made. For transactions between the Bank and the Borrower ( e.g. drawdowns) and \ntransactions within the Borrower’s account ( e.g. currency conversions), the Bank’s \nMethodology does employ Exact Matching.  \n753 As Mr Thompson explains (Thompson1/¶6.1 ff {D1/1/269}), there are 54 Unreturned \nPrepayments of which 12 do not involve any previous cycles of prepayments/returns of \nprepayment. In these 12 cases, the Unreturned Prepayment is funded by the Relevant \nDrawdowns using Exact Matching or the Bank’s Methodology. In the remaining 42 cases, \nthe Unreturned Prepayment was preceded by one or more cycle of prepayment and return \nof prepayment. The Bank’s Methodology connects the prepayment and return of \nprepayment. In all cases: ( i) the prepayment and return of prepayment are made under the \nsame supply agreement reference and in the same amount of US dollars; and ( ii) the return \nof prepayment is made within around 90 days of the prepayment in order to comply with \nUkrainian currency control regulations.  \n754 The experts agree that, applying the Bank’s Methodology, the Relevant Drawdowns are the \nsource of the Unreturned Prepayments: AccountancyJR1/¶2.2 {D4/1/4}. \n755 The Bank’s case is that the Relevant Drawdowns caused the Unreturned Prepayments: \nPOC/¶58A {A1/2/33}; Reply/¶36.1 {A1/25/68}. But for the Relevant Drawdown which \n(using Exact Matching or the Bank’s Methodology) funded the ‘first’ prepayment in any \ncycle, the final Unreturned Prepayment in that cycle would not have been made. \nAA2/15/381\n375 756 The Exact Matching methodology matches payment(s) into an account to payment(s) out \nof the account based on the quantum of the payments in and out, the dates of the payments, \nand the identity of the sender and recipient (see Davidson XX {Day25/48:24} - \n{Day25/49:8}, and the definition in Thompson1 {D1/1/8}) but ignores entirely the \nnarratives accompanying the payments.  \n757 Where a Relevant Drawdown funds a prepayment (or an Unreturned Prepayment), the \nExact Matching methodology follows those funds out of the Supplier’s account. For \nUS$1.412bn of Relevant Drawdowns, the funds are followed using Exact Matching to \npurported loan repayments to the Bank. \n758 Plainly, the two different methodologies produce different results. That is not surprising. \nOne seeks to deduce a cause and effect link between payments based on observable patterns: \nit addresses the question ‘under this scheme did payment A result in payment B?’. The other \njust asks ‘what happened to the exact funds comprising payment A?’. The former is \nappropriate where the exercise requires consideration of cause and effect. The latter might \nbe more appropriate for a proprietary tracing claim. One can illustrate the differences using \nhypotheticals. For example, if an individual makes a time deposit of US$100,000 with a bank, \nthe funds paid into the deposit account may be followed to other uses (per"}

One can illustrate the differences using \nhypotheticals. For example, if an individual makes a time deposit of US$100,000 with a bank, \nthe funds paid into the deposit account may be followed to other uses (perhaps to fund a \nmortgage advance made by the bank) but can be traced into the return of the time deposit \nin a different amount when it matures. The Exact Matching methodology would not link \nthe placing of the time deposit with its subsequent maturity. But, taking into account \ntransaction references, there is plainly a causative link between the two. \n759 It is not the case that the Bank’s Methodology is an unorthodox way to identify causative \nlinks between transactions, as the example above demonstrates:  \n(1) For the reasons Mr Thompson gave, ( i) there is nothing unconventional about taking \naccount of transaction references in a tracing exercise and ( ii) the transactional \nnarratives have meaning even if the underlying supply agreements are shams \n{Day24/39:15} - {Day24/47:21}. Indeed, D2 accepts that the supply agreement \nreferences were necessary to circumvent currency control regulations even though he \n(now) accepts they were shams – in other words, the supply agreements served an \nextraneous (‘real world’) purpose: see Section F  above.  \n(2) Mr Davidson accepted that it would be inappropriate to conduct an analysis of \ncausative links between prepayments and returns of prepayments while ignoring \ntransaction narratives (Davidson XX {Day25/28:11} - {Day25/29:6}). He also \n{AA2/15/149}\nAA2/15/382\n376 accepted ( i) that there is a pattern of 90-day prepayments and returns of prepayments \nidentifiable in the Bank’s transactional data which is explicable by Ukrainian currency \ncontrol regulations {Day25/30:23} - {Day25/36:5}, {Day25/80:1} - {Day25/83:8}; \n(ii) that the prepayments and returns of prepayment transactions “ are in the same flow \nand they’re connected ” {Day25/40:6-7}; and ( iii) there must have been a  “ preplanned scheme \nto cycle returns of prepayments into new prepayments ” {Day25/44:7-11}. \n(3) Mr Steadman suggested at one point that Exact Matching provides a “ better analysis ” \nwhere “ narratives on financial information are rare or inconclusive ” (Steadman2/¶¶2.2.5-2.2.6 \n{D3/12/7}).619 But he does not suggest that the narratives here are “ rare or inconclusive ” \nor that  the Bank’s Methodology is inappropriate for the purpose for which it is used. \n(4) For the reasons given in Section F , it is not the case that the Exact Matching shows \nwhat was going on in the ‘real world’ or is somehow more consistent with the factual \nmatrix than the Bank’s Methodology. While there was plainly money laundering on-\ngoing at the Bank (as demonstrated by the Davidson Payment Chains), that involved \nthe use of a scheme with a discernible pattern of cyclical prepayments and returns of \nprepayment which ended with the Unreturned Prepayments. \n(5) D2 has sought to suggest that the Bank’s Methodology has been applied in an \n“unprincipled ” way because in two instances (the Relevant Drawdowns by Prominmet \n(see {D1/515/7} and the Cypriot Borrowers {D1/64/1}, {D1/110}) the Bank has \ntraced ‘through’ a payment with a supply agreement reference.620 The Bank accepts \nthat in these two cases the task of identifying the Relevant Drawdown which caused \nthe Unreturned Prepayment is harder. But, as Mr Thompson explained, tracing \nbackwards from the Unreturned Prepayment in each case leads to the Relevant \nDrawdowns by Prominmet and the Cypriot Borrowers respectively: {Day24/95:4} - \n{Day24/97:3}.

But, as Mr Thompson explained, tracing \nbackwards from the Unreturned Prepayment in each case leads to the Relevant \nDrawdowns by Prominmet and the Cypriot Borrowers respectively: {Day24/95:4} - \n{Day24/97:3}. It is difficult to see where this point takes D1-2 in circumstances in \nwhich the experts all agree that, applying the Bank’s Methodology, the Relevant \n \n619  It is worth noting at this point that D2 has, at times, suggested that the transaction narratives are not authentic \nor are otherwise unreliable. Indeed, he served a Notice to Prove in respect of them on 13.4.23 {B5/3}. The \nBank provided a fulsome response to that Notice: see Bank Opening/¶364 {AA2/1/151} and Schedule 10 \n{AA2/4/1-68}. Little has been said by D2 on the topic since then, such that the Bank understands that no \nchallenge to their authenticity is maintained. If that is wrong, no doubt D2 will explain the position in his \nwritten closings, to which the Bank will respond orally. \n620  In the case of Prominmet, the UAH 157m Relevant Drawdown on 14.2.14 is traced into a payment from \nProminmet to Viglon on 17.2.14 and then from Viglon to Foxar on 18.214, before the first prepayment is \nmade by Foxar on 28.2.14. The payment from Prominmet to Viglon is described as a prepayment for hopper \nwagons and there is no corresponding return of prepayment in the Bank’s transactional data. In the case of the \nCypriot Borrowers, the payments from Adriana to Alfatrader (US$58m) and Milorin (US$60m) were described \nas prepayments without any corresponding return of prepayment: see Thompson5/¶¶3.4-3.14 {D1/515/8}. \n{AA2/15/149}\nAA2/15/383\n377 Drawdowns are the source of the Unreturned Prepayments: AccountancyJR1/¶2.2 \n{D4/1/4}. \n760 In summary, the Bank’s Methodology is appropriate for determining whether a Relevant \nDrawdown caused an Unreturned Prepayment to be made to D3-8 under the choreography \nof the fraudulent scheme that was being implemented. The Bank’s Methodology may also \nbe applied to identify ultimate sources of repayment of Relevant Drawdowns, although it \nmakes very little difference which methodology is used. \n(4) The forensic accountants  \n(a) Mr Thompson \n761 Mr Thompson has produced exhaustive reports which have covered all of the issues on \nwhich the parties had permission to call forensic accountancy evidence. He has had to \nrespond to repeated changes in Ds’ case, most notably ( i) the abandonment of the Lafferty \nSpreadsheets (which he analysed over c. 130 pages of Thompson1 {D1/1/138}) and their \nreplacement with the Davidson Tracing Exercise in Davidson1; ( ii) the introduction for the \nfirst time in Davidson2 (March 2022) of the RDPs; ( iii) the very late suggestion in Davidson3 \n(March 2023) that the Bank’s loss should be assessed in UAH alone (now disclaimed by Mr \nDavidson – see above) and/or a mix of UAH and USD, producing exhaustive alternative \ncalculations of loss in the Loss Matrix. And he responded with good grace to unfair XX (see \nfurther below). \n762 Mr Thompson gave fair and independent evidence which is of great assistance to the Court. \nD2’s attempts to call that into question in XX were unfounded and inappropriate:  \n(1) Mr Thompson was questioned on the basis he had simply applied the Bank’s \nMethodology and failed to identify other potential tracing methodologies \n{Day24/42:3-9} ff. It was put to him that this was an “ abdication of accounting \nresponsibility ” {Day24/52:13-18} and that he had “ deliberately looked at a very small slice of \npayments rather than allowing the court, through your report, to see something of the overall accounting \nposition ” {Day24/52:22-25}.

Those criticisms were unfair, and represented a \nmischaracterisation of what Mr Thompson was instructed to do in accordance with \nthe 1st CMC Order. The Bank had already identified the Relevant Drawdowns and the \nUnreturned Prepayments before Mr Thompson was instructed;621 his job was to check \n \n621  In Annex B to the Bank’s RRFI dated 5.5.20 {A2/11/1} (see too the reference to Thompson1/¶3.2(a) \n{D1/1/27}). Mr Thompson identified additional Relevant Drawdowns totaling US$1.46m which had not been \nincluded in the Bank’s case at the time of his report.  \nAA2/15/384\n378 whether the Bank’s case, which necessarily applied the Bank’s Methodology, was \naccurate and complete (see his instructions at {D1/4/5} (¶¶4.1(a)-(b)). \n(2) In respect of other issues on which Mr Thompson was instructed, he did consider and \napply alternative methodologies. He addressed the methodologies employed in D1’s \n(then) tracing exercise (Thompson1/¶5. 23ff {D1/1/157}) and he compared them to \nthe Bank’s Methodology (Thompson1/Section 6 {D1/1/268}). When considering \nthe Bank’s loss in his first report, Mr Thompson analysed the ultimate sources of \nrepayment of the Relevant Drawdowns both using the Bank’s Methodology and using \nExact Matching / Funds Flow (which he termed the ‘Alternative Methodology’) \n{D1/1/136}. His analysis of the transactional data using these two different \nmethodologies is typical of the way in which Mr Thompson has approached his \ninstructions, and undermines entirely the line of questioning from D2’s counsel, who \nsuggested that he had failed to identify any methodology other than the Bank’s \n{Day24/42:3-9} ff. \n(3) It was also put to Mr Thompson that he had not provided “ any analysis on your own part \nof where the money went, what the flow of funds were? ” {Day24/57:17-18}. That too was unfair \nin circumstances in which D1’s case on “ where the money went ” – as it stood at the time \nThompson1 was filed – was contained in the Lafferty Spreadsheets (compiled by the \nfraudsters themselves), which Mr Thompson considered in exhaustive detail, and he \nalso considered D3-8’s case on the onward payment of the Unreturned Prepayments. \n(b) Mr Davidson  \n763 At the risk of understatement, Mr Davidson was not an impressive expert witness: \n(1) In 2019, the Charity Commission appointed interim managers over two trusts of \nwhich Mr Davidson and his wife were trustees. It was concerned about loans of over \n£650,000 made by the trusts to or for the benefit of Mr Davidson; the purchase of \nantiques from Mr Davidson (or his wife); conflicts of interest; and failure to comply \nwith charity law {E17/285.001} {E17/285.002}. \n(2) In 2021, his former firm (Crowe Clark Whitehill) complained to the Institute of \nChartered Accountants of England and Wales ( “ICAEW” ) that Mr Davidson had \ngiven a client his personal bank details on an invoice “ falsely representing that they were the \nbank account details of [CCW ] for the purposes of the client paying money due against invoices raised \nin relation to [CCW’s ] engagement ” and then issued false credit notes to disguise the fraud \n{E18/25.2.1/3}. \nAA2/15/385\n379 (3) In November and December 2021, the ICAEW’s Investigation Committee \ncommenced an investigation into these complaints (recorded in their decision \ncollectively as ‘complaint 2’). On 18.11.21, the Committee sent Mr Davidson a formal \nnotice requiring him to provide information explanations and documents in relation \nto the complaint from his former firm and in relation to the two charities \n{E18/25.2.1/3}. Mr Davidson told the ICAEW on 25.10.21 (by email) and 24.12.21 \n(via his solicitors) that he would provide a response to those complaints \n{E18/25.2.1/5}"}

Mr Davidson told the ICAEW on 25.10.21 (by email) and 24.12.21 \n(via his solicitors) that he would provide a response to those complaints \n{E18/25.2.1/5}. He did not do so. \n(4) On 8.3.23, the ICAEW’s Disciplinary Committee held a hearing in relation to the \ncomplaints, being Mr Davidson’s failure to provide documents, information and \nexplanations in relation to ‘complaint 2’. Mr Davison admitted both complaints on \nthe day; he was severely reprimanded and fined £5,000; and he was ordered to provide \nthe documents, information and explanations within 28 days {E18/25.2.1/6}. He \naccepted he had no excuse for breaching his professional duties to provide \ninformation to the ICAEW {Day25/12:13-15}. \n(5) Mr Davidson failed to comply with the Disciplinary Committee’s decision. As a result, \nhe was “ cessated ” as a member of the ICAEW on 29.4.23. It is to be inferred that he \ndid not pay the fine in order to procure his cessation and to remove any basis for the \nICAEW to continue to investigate the substance of his misconduct. \n(6) Mr Davidson did not mention the complaints in his expert reports. When it was put \nto him that they were matters of which he should have informed the Court as part of \nhis overriding duty as an independent expert he claimed he “ did not know the answer to \nthat” {Day25/9:11-14}. At best, that was a striking admission that Mr Davidson was \nsimply unaware of his duties to the Court; at worst, it was dishonest. \n(7) Mr Davidson did not mention either the ICAEW’s Disciplinary Committee’s decision \nor the fact that he had ceased to be a member of the ICAEW in the 2nd Joint Report \n(filed on 23.5.23). He had not informed any of the parties or the Court when the \nmatter was raised in Hogan Lovells’ letter to Fieldfisher on 31.7.23 {L/188.1} (or, \nindeed, for almost two months thereafter). He accepted that his failure to update his \nreports to reflect his cessation was a breach of his duties as an expert. Although he \ndodged the question as to whether it was a deliberate or careless breach, it was clearly \nthe former: {Day25/5:4} - {Day25/6:2}. \nAA2/15/386\n380 (8) On Friday 29.9.23, two working days before he was due to give evidence, Mr Davidson \nfiled a witness statement (under cover of a letter from his criminal defence solicitors) \ninvoking the privilege against self-incrimination in relation to the substance of these \ncomplaints: {L/220.1}, {L/220.2}. Mr Davidson confirmed in XX that he would \nrefuse to answer questions in relation to the substance of these matters on the basis \nthat his answers would tend to expose him to the risk of criminal proceedings: see \n{Day25/6:19} - {Day25/7:3}. The obvious inference is that Mr Davidson has \nengaged in dishonest conduct. \n(9) Finally, Mr Davidson lied to the Court about the basis on which he failed to respond \nto the ICAEW’s investigations. As set out above, Mr Davidson told the ICAEW’s \nInvestigation Committee on 25.10.21 and 24.12.21 that he would provide a response \nto the complaints {E18/25.2.1/5}. Yet in his witness statement for these proceedings, \nMr Davidson claimed that “ At the time of the correspondence [with the ICAEW ], I did not \nbelieve I could provide the information to ICAEW because of a number of issues of Confidentiality \nand Privilege ” {L/220.2/2} (¶13). That is clearly untrue in circumstances in which Mr \nDavidson wrote twice to the ICAEW to say that he would provide a response, without \nmentioning any confidentiality or privilege concerns (see {Day25/11:16-21}). \n764 Key aspects of Mr Davidson’s evidence demonstrated his propensity to act as an advocate \nfor his client rather than as an independent ex"}

As we explain below, the analysis he \nchose to adopt on key points was intended to reduce the loss for which D1-2 would be \nliable. That included ( i) inappropriately combining the Repayment Defence and Use of \nFunds Defence; ( ii) adopting the ‘Bridging Loan Methodology’; ( iii) identifying RDPs as the \n‘starting point’ for the Bank’s claim; and ( iv) contending that the Bank’s loss was felt entirely \nin UAH (a point he disclaimed in oral evidence {Day25/150:7-10} ( Section O  below)). \n(c) Mr Steadman \n765 Mr Steadman’s evidence served very little purpose except to underline his partisan approach \nto the limited issues he chose to consider. \n766 Indicia of misappropriation. In Section 5 of his first report, Mr Steadman under the heading \n“absence of indications of Misappropriation ” considered the “ available information in relation to the \nalleged Misappropriation ”. This was an extraordinarily partial exercise: \n(1) Mr Steadman considered two factors: ( i) there was no increase in the value of lending \nto 466 Bank customers (ignoring the increase in the lending to the Borrowers) and ( ii) \nthe Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers made de minimis  direct transfers to \n{AA2/15/491}\nAA2/15/387\n381 accounts outside PrivatBank (ignoring the thousands of transfers made to accounts \noutside the Bank by the other c. 400 customers622): Steadman1/¶¶5.2-5.4 {D3/1/25}. \nThe partial nature of that exercise was exposed by Mr Thompson: see \nThompson2/¶6.111 ff {D1/347/106}. It should have been obvious to Mr Steadman \nthat only looking at direct payments out of the Borrowers’ and Intermediary \nBorrowers’ accounts was pointless given the way money circulated at the Bank. \n(2) When asked in XX about other potential indicators of Misappropriation that he \nshould have mentioned in this part of his report in order to present a balanced picture, \nMr Steadman’s answers demonstrated his partisan approach to this exercise. We give \ntwo examples below: \n“Q. If it were right that hundreds of millions of dollars flowed from the relevant \ndrawdowns, using a funds flow analysis, into the [D1-2’s] operating companies, you would \nsay that’s not an  indication of misappropriation? \nA. Well, as I say, not necessarily. Not necessarily {Day26/17:1-6} \n… \nQ. Isn’t the fact that even when forensic accountants spend  days and weeks trying to \nfollow what happened to the  relevant drawdowns, they are unable to work out what  \nhappened to somewhere between 557 and a billion dollars  of it -- isn’t that an indication \nof misappropriation,  Mr Steadman? \nA. Well, I don’t think so. I think it’s an indication that  they can’t follow what’s happened \nto the money, I’m  assuming because it’s got itself commingled with other funds such that \nyou can’t tell how the funds flow forward. If we’re asked to say has there been  a \nmisappropriation, then I think there has to be an end point to determinatively answer that \nquestion rather than, ‘I don’t know, therefore it’s misappropriation’.” {Day26/28:4-17}623 \n767 Money laundering v ‘loan recycling’. It was put to Mr Steadman that the payment chains seen \nin the transactional data had all the hallmarks of money laundering.

He was \n \n622  See Steadman XX {Day26/55:6-22}. \n623  Mr Steadman’s answer – “ it’s got itself commingled with other funds ” – is laughable. Funds do not co-mingle \nthemselves. \nAA2/15/388\n382 apparently oblivious to the fact that hiding the fraudsters’ gains and disguising the victim’s \nloss are two sides of the same coin.  \n768 The Bank’s 2016 financial statements. In Section 3 of his first report, Mr Steadman reported \nthat the Bank recorded a ‘loss event’ in its 2016 financial statements by reference to the New \nLoans {D3/1/15}. His evidence (irrelevant, in light of his agreement in the Joint Report \nthat the Bank is not claiming for an accounting loss: AccountancyJR2/¶6.4 {D4/2/18}) was \npartial: \n(1) He made no mention of the auditor’s qualification in the accounts as to the period the \nimpairment related to {K1/6/3}. When presented with this in XX, he said “ I don’t \nreally care too much about what the auditors have said ” {Day26/72:7-8}. That was remarkable \nevidence for an accountant, and all the more extraordinary given his reliance on the \n‘clean’ audits in the 2013 and 2014 financial statements (Steadman2/¶3.3.5(ii) \n{D3/12/13}); \n(2) He did not explain the accounting rules which apply where an entity discovers a prior \nperiod error (see Thompson2/¶¶6.45-6.66 {D1/347/85}). Those rules make it clear \nthat the Bank was acting in accordance with the rules in showing the impairment in \n2016 when there was a lack of objective evidence at the time as to when the loss might \nhave arisen.  \n(3) Mr Steadman’s oral evidence was “ if you know that there is a loan circulation scheme in place, \nthen the first question is ‘Well, what existing loss is that disguising’ and then ‘How has that loss \nchanged as a result of further cycles?’ ” {Day26/84:3-7}. That is fundamentally inconsistent \nwith the implication of his evidence that, because the Bank only recorded an \nimpairment of the New Loans in 2016, the Bank’s loss was somehow suffered for the \nfirst time in 2016. \nM3 THE QUANTIFICATION OF THE BANK’S LOSS : STARTING POINT  \n769 The Bank relies on the following propositions:  \n(1) Each of the 270 Relevant Drawdowns constituted a misappropriation of the Bank’s \nfunds procured by D1-2.  \n(2) The misappropriation of the Bank’s funds pursuant to the Relevant Drawdowns was \nconcealed by the generation of sham Relevant Loan Agreements by D1-2’s minions \nin BOK and PBC. There was no true relationship of borrower and lender generated \nby the drawdowns or the agreements. The Relevant Loan Agreements were void. \nAA2/15/389\n383 (3) Between 1.11.13 and 1.9.14 there were 270 Relevant Drawdowns made under 134 \npurported Relevant Loan Agreements totalling US$2,335,943,519: \nAccountancyJR1/¶2.2(a) {D4/1/4}. \n(4) In some cases, Relevant Drawdown A was recorded in the Bank’s books as being used \n(in part) to repay Relevant Drawdown B (by the same or another Borrower).

If the \nBank claimed for Relevant Drawdowns A and B, it would be double-counting. \nAccordingly, the Bank’s claim gives credit for instances in which Relevant Drawdowns \nrepaid Relevant Drawdowns. Applying the Bank’s Methodology, the total of Relevant \nDrawdowns which repaid Relevant Drawdowns is US$384,214,201 to give a net total \nof Relevant Drawdowns of US$1,951,729,318: Thompson1/Table 7-3 \n{D1/1/281}.624 See further below.  \n(5) The sum claimed by the Bank in the Claim Form is US$1,911,877,385: {A1/1/1}. \nThat is the exact sum of the Unreturned Prepayments which at the time the Claim \nForm was issued ( i.e. before the forensic accountants had opined) represented the best \nassessment of its loss it was able to give. Although it later emerged that the net total \nof the Relevant Drawdowns was slightly higher, the Bank has been content to retain \nits claim for the lower figure in the interests of conservatism. But the important point \nfor present purposes is this: the Bank claims it suffered a loss caused by the Relevant \nDrawdowns (and not some proportional part of the Relevant Drawdowns which \ncontributed to the Unreturned Prepayments: see Reply/¶27B.4.1 {A1/25/37}). See \nfurther below. \n(6) Accordingly, the Bank suffered a loss caused by D1-2’s tortious conduct of at least \nUS$1,911,877,385. \n770 We give two simplified examples below:  \n(1) Uniks : on 31.7.14 at 5pm Uniks made a Relevant Drawdown of US$1,000 and on \n1.8.14 at 12.12pm it made a further Relevant Drawdown of US$36,799,000 \n{D1/21P}. Uniks was owned and controlled by D1-2; they procured the Relevant \nDrawdown via their lieutenants in BOK and PBC; and the Relevant Loan Agreement \n(4U14262D) pursuant to which the drawdown was made was void. As at 2.8.14 D1 \nand D2 were liable to the Bank in tort in the sum of US$36,800,000.  \n \n624 Applying the Funds Flow methodology, the figures are US$459,168,743 and US$1,876,774,776 respectively: \nsee Loss Matrix, cells E21-25 {D1/521P/4}.  \nAA2/15/390\n384 (2) Techspets : on 8.11.13 Techspets made a Relevant Drawdown of US$30m and on \n29.4.14 it made a further Relevant Drawdown of UAH 256.8m (US$22.5m): {D1/14}, \n{D1/15P} (rows 9 and 18). Techspets was owned and controlled by D1-2; they \nprocured the Relevant Drawdowns; and the Relevant Loan Agreements (4T13710D \nand 4T14151I) were void. In this case, applying the Bank’s methodology, US$22.5m \nof the 8.11.13 Relevant Drawdown was recorded as repaying the 29.4.14 Relevant \nDrawdown. The net Relevant Drawdowns made by Techspets is accordingly US$30m, \nand that is the sum for which the Bank claims in tort. \n(3) When applied across the full population of Relevant Drawdowns, this process \naccounts for the overwhelming majority of the difference between the total amount \nof the Relevant Drawdowns ( c. US$2.3bn) and the amount of the Bank’s claim ( c. \nUS$1.9bn). \n(1) Relevant Drawdowns repaying Relevant Drawdowns \n771 Ds say that the Bank has not explained the distinction between ( i) Relevant Drawdown A \nrepaid by Relevant Drawdown B which the Bank accepts reduces its loss and ( ii) Relevant \nDrawdown A repaid by Intermediary Drawdown B which does not reduce the Bank’s loss: \nsee e.g. MHKC {Day6/25:17} - {Day6/26:6}.  \n772 The difference between the two scenarios is that the Bank’s claim is for the loss suffered as \na result of the Relevant Drawdowns, not for loss suffered as a result of the Intermediary \nDrawdowns.

The Bank cannot and does not contend that it suffered a loss of the whole \namount of the Relevant Drawdowns (US$2.3bn) because US$384m of those Relevant \nDrawdowns were in effect reversed during the scheme i.e. genuinely paid back to the Bank \nwithout additional money being taken to fund that. The position is self-evidently different \nwhere the money used to ‘repay’ the Relevant Drawdown is not itself a Relevant Drawdown; \nbut is further misappropriated money, in respect of which the Bank does not make a claim \n(an Intermediary Drawdown). \n773 To take a simple example:  \n(1) If a claimant claims for a loss of US$100 consisting of 10 misappropriations of US$10 \neach by a fraudster, but three of those US$10 thefts were paid back by the fraudster \n(from the US$100 and without any further theft), the claimant’s position is that it has \nsuffered a loss of US$70. There is a closed loop in which the claimant’s loss must be \nquantified. \nAA2/15/391\n385 (2) If a claimant makes the same claim for US$100 (10 misappropriations of US$10 each) \nbut then suffers three further misappropriations of US$10 each the proceeds of which \nare returned purportedly to reduce the first three $10 thefts, the claimant’s overall loss \nremains US$100. On the Bank’s case, as set out below, the loss caused by the original \n10 x US$10 thefts is unaffected by the subsequent thefts and the use of their proceeds. \nIt is not required to reduce its original loss by reference to the purported repayments \nsourced from other misappropriations.625 \n(2) “Relevant Drawdown Portions” \n774 Ds seek to characterise the Bank’s claim as being for that percentage part of each Relevant \nDrawdown which, applying the Bank’s Methodology, contributed to the Unreturned \nPrepayments ( sc. the Relevant Drawdown Portions): see D1Def/¶¶55A-55AA {A1/8/29}. \nBut that ignores the way in which the claim is expressly pleaded (“ It is denied that the Bank \nclaims that only part of the Relevant Drawdowns caused it loss. It is the Bank’s case that the Relevant \nDrawdowns caused it a loss in the sum claimed .”: Reply/¶27B.4.1 {A1/25/37}). In circumstances \nwhere D1 accepts that this is ultimately a “ pleading issue ” (D1 Opening/¶425 {AA3/1/130}) \nand where the Bank’s pleadings are clear on the point, that is an end of the matter.  \n775 If the starting point for the Bank’s claim were Relevant Drawdown Portions (which it is \nnot), Mr Davidson’s approach of then switching methodologies and making further \ndeductions for Relevant Drawdowns repaying Relevant Drawdowns is unprincipled and \nself-contradictory: \n(1) The experts have agreed on how those RDPs are identified: AccountancyJR2/¶2.1.2 \n{D4/2/5}; Thompson3/¶2.5 {D1/440/7}; Davidson XX {Day25/110:15} - \n{Day25/111:3}). \n(2) The experts also agree that RDPs can only be identified by applying the Bank’s \nMethodology (Davidson XX {Day25/107:10-13}, Thompson XX {Day23/85:3-6}). \nBy definition, an RDP is that portion of a Relevant Drawdown which can be attributed \nto an Unreturned Prepayment. And the methodology which links Relevant \nDrawdowns with Unreturned Prepayments is the Bank’s Methodology.  \n \n625  In principle, the victim of the theft can elect how to frame its claim (Ukrainian law being no different to English \nlaw on this). It can treat the US$100 as lost when it was first stolen and disregard the three later thefts as \nproviding no true compensation for that. Or it could, if it had full knowledge of the facts and a free choice \nframe its claim as a loss arising from the whole conduct or from the seven ‘unrepaid’ original US$10 thefts \ntogether with the three later US$10 thefts. All would lead to the same result. \nAA2/15/392\n386 (3) If the Bank’s Methodology is "}

All would lead to the same result. \nAA2/15/392\n386 (3) If the Bank’s Methodology is applied to identify the ultimate sources of repayment of \nRDPs, 39.8% were repaid by Asset Transfer and 54% by Transformation: \nAccountancyJR2/¶4.1 {D4/2/10}; Thompson3/¶5.13 {D1/440/68}. Mr \nThompson’s calculation of the Bank’s loss, starting with RDPs and applying the \nBank’s Methodology, is US$1.8bn: Thompson3/¶5.17 {D1/440/70}. In other words, \nthere is a de minimis  difference between the calculation of the Bank’s loss starting with \nRelevant Drawdowns and the calculation taking RDPs as the starting point and \napplying the Bank’s Methodology to identify ultimate repayments.  \n(4) Mr Davidson and Mr Steadman consider that it is appropriate to apply the Exact \nMatching methodology to determine how RDPs were repaid: Davidson2/¶3.25 \n{D2/11/27}; AccountancyJR2/¶2.3.1 {D4/2/7}. In other words, they consider it \nappropriate ( i) to use the Bank’s Methodology to identify the RDPs but then ( ii) to \nuse the Exact Matching methodology to identify how the RDPs were repaid.  \n(5) The result of this mixing of methodologies is that, according to Mr Davidson, c. \nUS$332m of RDPs were used to repay RDPs: see Davidson2/¶3.28 {D2/11/28}. \nTaking that to its logical conclusion, Mr Davidson is saying that US$332m of the \nRelevant Drawdowns which were used to fund Unreturned Prepayments are also to \nbe traced as repaying other RDPs. That is a definitional oxymoron.  \n(6) The consequence of mixing methodologies can be demonstrated by reference to the \nRelevant Drawdowns by AEF:  \n(a) AEF made three Relevant Drawdowns under three Relevant Loans (US$34m \nunder -78D ( “RD1” ), US$11m under -97D ( “RD2” ) and UAH 205m \n(US$20m) under -80I ( “RD3” )) (see also and {D1/10}). AEF then made an \nUnreturned Prepayment of US$45m to D4. Applying the Bank’s Methodology, \nRD3 was repaid using US$20m of the proceeds of the RD1 and RD2 ( i.e. this \nwas a case of Relevant Drawdowns repaying Relevant Drawdowns) so the \nBank’s claim in respect of the three Relevant Drawdowns by AEF is US$45m.  \nAA2/15/393\n387  \n(b) Applying the Bank’s Methodology to identify RDPs, the Unreturned \nPrepayment of US$45m is funded by the three Relevant Drawdowns as follows: \nThompson3/App. 5-1-1, 5-1-1-2, 5-1-1-3 {D1/452} \n \nRelevant \nDrawdown  Amount RDP %  RDP \n(App 5-1-1-1, \ncells L10-L13)  Amount allocated to \nrepayment of other \nRelevant Drawdowns \n(App 5-1-1-3) \nRD1 US$11m 54% US$6m US$4.7m \nRD2 US$34m 55% US$18.7m US$14.7m \nRD3 UAH 203m (US$20m) 99% US$19.9m - \nTotal US$65m  US$44.7m626 US$19.5m \n \n \n626  The difference between the RDPs here (US$44.7m) and the Unreturned Prepayment (US$45m) is an FX Top-\nup which appears in the diagram above.  \nAA2/15/394\n388 (c) Applying the Exact Matching Methodology, RD3 repaid itself (it was a “ bounce \nback” or “ round trip ” to use D1’s terminology) – see the diagram at \nDavidson1/App 8-1-003-1 {D2/9/14}: \n \n(d) The mixing of methodologies results in the following repayment analysis:  \n(i) Bank Methodology (to identify the RDPs): RD1 and RD2 are reduced \nfrom US$45m to c. US$25m because US$20m of those Relevant \nDrawdowns is applied to repay all of US$20m under RD3.  \n(ii) Funds Flow: RD3 is treated as repaying itself (see too Mr Davidson’s \nanalysis at Davidson2/App 6 {D2/17/4} (top 3 rows)).  \n(iii) The US$20m under RD3 is therefore treated as repaid twice. Once in \nidentifying the RDP and again in applying the Funds Flow. \n(e) Mr Thompson explained this difficulty at Thompson3/¶4.35 ff {D1/440/36} \nand in evidence at {Day23/115:16-25}: \n“Yes."}
{"start": 1078000, "text": "from US$45m to c.

So, my Lord, if I may, really the heart of the matter is this, that under the \nBank’s methodology, if you’re in relevant drawdown portion land, relevant \ndrawdowns 1 and 2 repay relevant drawdown 3. In the alternative methodology, \nrelevant drawdown 3 repays itself. So the issue there is, having created your \nrelevant drawdown portion and having had 1 and 2 repay 3, is it appropriate then \nto shift from the Bank’s methodology to alternative methodology and have \nrelevant drawdown 3 repay itself?” \n(f) The answer to Mr Thompson’s question is a very obvious “ no”. It cannot be \nappropriate to apply two different methodologies so that the same drawdown \nis treated as repaid twice. \nAA2/15/395\n389 (g) By contrast, applying the Bank’s Methodology to identify the ultimate sources \nof repayment of three RDPs totalling US$45m, that ultimate source of all three \nis the Asset Transfer: Thompson4/App5-2-1 (rows 9-11) {D1/454P}. \n(7) Mr Davidson did not have any good explanation for how US$65m of Relevant \nDrawdowns, which funded US$45m of Unreturned Prepayments, should produce a \nloss of US$25m in this way, except to accept that “ two different methodologies can apply a \ndeduction in different ways ” {Day25/118:6-15}. But he also recognised that if you apply \none methodology consistently to the process of identifying repayments of Relevant \nDrawdowns, there will be no double-counting: {Day25/126:9-12}.  \n(8) This double-counting of repayments accounts for the US$332m in RDPs said to have \nbeen the ultimate source of repayment of RDPs (or approximately 16% of the Bank’s \nclaim): AccountancyJR2/¶4.2 {D4/2/11}. It appears that Mr Davidson has adopted \nthis cocktail of methodologies for the primary purpose of reducing the loss for which \nthe Bank can claim.  \n776 Accordingly, Mr Davidson’s RDPs are a red herring, because the Bank’s claim is for the loss \narising from the misappropriation of the Relevant Drawdowns, and not just part of them. \nBut even if Mr Davidson had been correct that the Bank’s case should start from the RDPs \n(even though that is not how it is pleaded), the only consistent basis on which to identify \nthe ultimate sources of repayment of the RDPs is to apply the Bank’s Methodology.  \nM4 THE REPAYMENT DEFENCE  \n777 The accountancy experts agree that, with two exceptions, the Relevant Drawdowns are \nrecorded in the Bank’s books as having been repaid. They also agree on ( i) the direct sources \nand ( ii) the ultimate sources of repayment (using the Bank’s Methodology or Exact \nMatching): AccountancyJR2/¶4.1 {D4/2/10-11}; Thompson XX {Day23/101:20-23}. Ds \nsay that, because the Relevant Drawdowns are recorded in the Bank’s books as repaid, the \nBank has suffered no loss caused by those Relevant Drawdowns. \n778 Applying the Ukrainian law set out above (under which the key question is whether as a \nmatter of fact the harm to the Bank from the taking of its money through the Relevant \nDrawdowns has been “fully compensated”), the Repayment Defence should be rejected: \n(1) The Bank received no, or no significant, value as a result of the purported repayments \nrelied on by Ds. The repayment of Relevant Drawdowns by Intermediary Drawdowns \nand New Loans did not make the Bank whole, and the Asset Transfer involved book \nAA2/15/396\n390 entry repayments of Relevant Drawdowns of US$683m attributable to assets worth \nonly US$205m.  \n(2) The Repayment Defence conflates the tortious loss resulting from D1-2’s conduct in \nprocuring the Relevant Draw"}

They are not the same \nthing.  \n(3) The Bank has elected to sue on the Relevant Drawdowns, and is entitled to do so even \nif there was earlier or later fraudulent conduct by D1-2. The Bank is entitled to identify \nthe harm suffered as the extraction of its monies caused by those fraudulent \ndrawdowns, and the loss as the amount of that harm that has not been subject of \ngenuine repayment. It is not for the fraudsters to contend that the Bank is somehow \nconfined to a claim focussed on later fraudulent conduct aimed at concealing the \nearlier fraud, not at truly making it good.  \n(1) The correct approach under Ukrainian law: a factual assessment based on principles \nof justice, good faith and reasonableness, and full compensation \n779 We have set out above the Ukrainian law principles applicable to the Repayment Defence. \nThey are those of justice, good faith and reasonableness, and full compensation. The \nassessment of loss under Ukrainian law is a factual assessment, applying those principles. \nUkrainian law also allows (as part and parcel of those principles) the victims of torts to elect \nwhich wrongs to sue on and how to frame their claims. \n(2) English law comparisons \n780 English courts apply very similar principles. We outline that below for completeness, and \ngiven the presumption of sameness and onus on a party alleging a material difference of \napproach under a foreign law to make that good. \n781 First, in contrast to the position under Ukrainian law, the English courts have considered \nthe situation in which a claimant has overlapping claims for successive breaches of contract \nagainst two defendants, concurrent claims against two tortfeasors, and analogous cases in \nwhich two claims are brought to recover substantially the same loss. In those cases: \n(1) The fact that the claimant has accepted a sum in settlement of its claim against one \ncontract breaker or concurrent tortfeasor does not have the automatic effect in law of \nreleasing the other: Heaton v AXA Equity and Law [2002] 2 AC 329 at [9] (Lord \nAA2/15/397\n391 Hope) {M1/8.5/9}. Rather a claimant is in general entitled to freedom to make claims \nagainst any and all wrongdoers. \n(2) The basic limit is the principle against double (or over) recovery: a claimant cannot \nrecover in the aggregate from one or more of the defendants an amount which is in \nexcess of his loss: “ once a plaintiff has fully recouped his loss, of necessity he cannot thereafter \npursue any other remedy he might have and which he might have pursued earlier…This principle of \nfull satisfaction prevents double recovery ”: Heaton at [64].  \n(3) Accordingly, if the claimant accepts a sum from one wrongdoer which satisfies the \nwhole of the claimant’s loss, the claimant cannot bring a claim against the other \nwrongdoer for the same loss: Heaton at [5], [9], [70], [83].  \n(4) The same principles apply by analogy to a situation in which a claimant has two claims \nagainst different wrongdoers for the same loss, or where the losses claimed from each \ndefendant are ‘two sides to the same coin’ ( e.g. (i) a claim against a director for paying \nan illegal dividend, and a claim against the recipient for return of the dividend; ( ii) a \nclaim for breach of contract against a contractual counter-party, and a claim in tort \nagainst third parties for inducing breach of contract): Officeserve Technologies "}

The only restriction is that he is not entitled to \nAA2/15/398\n392 double recover: Foskett v McKeown [2001] 1 AC 102 at 117-118 (Lord Hope) \n{M1/8.3/16-17}. \n(3) Where goods are misappropriated from a victim and pass through the hands of \nmultiple parties, each of the intervening recipients of the goods is liable in conversion \nfor the value of the goods ( i.e. the loss suffered by the victim) even if such a person \nhas not caused any additional loss over and above that caused by the original thief: \nKuwait Airways v Iraqi Airways (No 4 & 5) [2002] 2 AC 883 at [81]-[82] (Lord \nNicholls) {M1/8.6/34}. A victim can sue any one defendant, including one who was \nin the middle of a chain of transfers, for the full loss.  \n(4) A similar point was made in International Factors v Rodriguez [1979] QB 351 (CA) at \n358H-359C {M1/3.4/8}. In that case a company sold its book debts to the claimant \nand was required to hand over to the claimant any payments made to it in respect of \nthose debts; debtors sent four cheques to the company; and the director of the \ncompany procured the cheques to be paid into the company’s account. The director \nwas held liable in tort for conversion of the cheques, but contended on appeal that \nthe claimant had suffered no loss because it had a right of action in contract against \nthe debtors. Sir David Cairns (with whom Bridge and Buckley LJJ agreed) disagreed:  \n“It is said here that the plaintiffs are not shown to have suffered any damage and \ncertainly not the amount of damages which they claim, because they still have a right \nof action against the debtors. That seems to me to be no ground upon which the \ndefendant can escape from paying damages in full. The position simply is that, \nassuming, as I will, that there is a right of action against the debtors, a plaintiff who has \ntwo causes of action cannot be met when he makes a claim against one defendant by \nthe answer: “Oh, no; you’ve suffered nothing by my tort because you have a cause of \naction against somebody else.” That clearly cannot be right. To take an example, if X \nwrongfully converted Y’s motor car and handed it to Z, an auctioneer, who innocently \nsold it, Y could recover full damages from Z and it would be no answer to his claim to \nsay that he had an equal claim against X. This is an a fortiori case, because "}

This is an a fortiori case, because here it is the \ndefendant who is the wrongdoer, and, in my judgment, he cannot set up against the \nplaintiffs’ claim to the full value of the cheques the contention that the plaintiffs could \ncall upon the debtors to pay over again for goods that they have already paid for, though \nunfortunately they made the mistake of paying them to the wrong person at the time.” \n(5) As a matter of English law, where there are successive torts, “ it is no answer for the \ndefendant to say that, but for his wrongdoing which has in fact resulted in loss, the same loss would \nhave been suffered because of some other tort or legal wrong was or would have been committed at a \nlater point in time whether by the defendant or someone else…the “but for” test is usually applied by \nasking whether but for the wrongdoing the loss would have been lawfully suffered. This qualification \nensures that a victim is not made worse off by further wrongdoing ”: Lakatamia at [938] (Bryan J) \n{M1/23.2/211}.  \nAA2/15/399\n393 783 Thirdly, the English cases relied upon by Ds in relation to the Repayment Defence do not \nsupport their position at all.  \n(1) In Komercni Banka v Stone Rolls [2003] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 383 {M1/9}, the claimant \nbank sued for a loss of US$94m paid out under 30 letters of credit issued in favour of \nthe defendant ( “SR” ) at the request of BCL. Toulson J held that the letters of credit \nhad been procured by deceit and SR was liable for the sum of US$94m ([153]). SR \nargued that US$64m+ of those funds had been funnelled back to the bank in discharge \nof liabilities owed by BCL arising under other letters of credit ([162]-[163]). In other \nwords, this was a ‘use of funds’ defence. Toulson J held that the defence was not \navailable: “ consider next the position if the fraudster decides to use the proceeds of his fraud to \ndischarge a liability owed to the bank by a third party. I reject the argument that he would be entitled \nto have that matter taken into account as a relevant benefit to the bank when calculating the loss \nresulting from his fraud ” ([171]). \n(2) In the course of his judgment, Toulson J expressed the view that “ if the proceeds of LC \nNo 2 were used to reimburse the bank in respect of LC No 1, that would extinguish the bank’s loss \nin respect of LC No 1 ” [168] (a point on which D1’s leading counsel relied heavily during \noral opening {Day6/51:11} - {Day6/52:19}). But the main issue Toulson J was \nconcerned with was the ‘use of funds’ defence; he was not concerned with the \nrepayment defence (because the bank was suing on LC No. 2 ( i.e. the unreimbursed \nletter of credit) and not LC No. 1 (purportedly repaid using the funds under LC No. \n2)). Toulson J’s analysis also plainly concerned the successive repayment of valid \ncontractual debts. It did not address the question whether a third-party tortfeasor who \nprocured LC No. 1 might be liable in tort for the loss caused by LC No 1 \nnotwithstanding the purported repayment of LC No. 1 using the fraudulent extraction \nof further funds under LC No. 2.  \n(3) In NBT v Yurov {M1/22} NBT brought a claim against its former shareholders for \nloss caused by a fraudulent lending scheme. As Bryan J explained, “ the Bank’s claim is \nbased on the outstanding debt owed by the Borrowers ”: see [4], [1172] {M1/22/364}, [1180]. \nThe shareholders ran the ‘use of funds’ defence (called the ‘Deferred Loss’ and \n‘Circular Credit’ points) which was rejected. In the course of rejecting the use of funds \ndefence, Bryan "}
{"start": 1092000, "text": "extraction \nof further funds under LC No. 2.  \n(3) In NBT v Yurov {M1/22} NBT brought a claim against its former shareholders for \nloss caused by a fraudulent lending scheme. As Bryan J explained, “ the Bank’s claim is \nbased on the outstanding debt owed by the Borrowers ”: see [4], [1172] {M1/22/364}, [1180]. \nThe shareholders ran the ‘use of funds’ defence (called the ‘Deferred Loss’ and \n‘Circular Credit’ points) which was rejected. In the course of rejecting the use of funds \ndefence, Bryan said that “…when wrongfully obtained money is used to repay the initial loan, the \noriginal loan loss is not “deferred”, it is extinguished. What subsists, is the loss caused by the fraud, \nAA2/15/400\n394 not the original lending. This loss (even if in the same amount) is a different loss caused by a different \nevent…” [1194] {M1/22/370}. \n(4) In this passage the Judge was manifestly addressing a valid previous loan. And the \nBank does not dispute that if there is a pre-existing, valid debt which is repaid using \nthe proceeds of a further loan, then the contractual debt of the borrower under the \nfirst loan is extinguished. That was the position in NBT v Yurov. But it is not the \nposition in this case, in which the Bank claims not for either contractual debt or loss \nin the form of being induced to enter valid debt contracts which turn out bad, but \nrather for tortious liability arising from misappropriation of its funds by the Relevant \nDrawdowns. That loss is not compensated by the fraudsters procuring further \nfraudulent drawdowns and using those to reduce or eliminate the recorded debts of \nthe Borrowers in the Bank’s books. That is the case whether the loans (or either of \nthem) are valid or void. \n(3) The Bank has not been fully compensated for its loss by the purported repayments \nin this case \n(a) Overview \n784 Ds could only ever establish a ‘Repayment’ Defence if the harm caused by their tortious acts \nhad been really been “ fully compensated ” (see Alyoshin2/¶42 {C7/1/18}). That did not \nhappen. \n785 The essential fallacy in the ‘Repayment’ Defence is that it presents a series of further \nfraudulent loans, under which no assets were contributed to the Bank, as ‘full compensation’. \nIn advancing that case, D1-2 have made no serious attempt to say that the further fraudulent \nloans they present as ‘repayment’ were anything other steps to cover up what had been done \nbefore. And, critically, they make no attempt at all to say that these steps provided any \ngenuine additional value to the Bank by way of compensation. Instead, Ds muddle “ full \ncompensation ” for the purposes of a tort claim, with the question of what is recorded in \nfraudulent book entries, put in place by way of cover up rather than compensation. In the \nend their defence would require the Court to conclude that steps which indisputably \nprovided no real compensation to the Bank at all provided “ full compensation ”.  \n(b) The facts \n786 The facts are not in serious dispute: \nAA2/15/401\n395 (1) The Relevant Drawdowns are recorded as repaid in the Bank’s ledgers by a \ncombination of ( i) the Relevant Drawdowns themselves (which, as explained above, \nthe Bank accepts reduces its loss), ( ii) Intermediary Drawdowns, ( iii) New Loans and \n(iv) Asset Transfer. \n(2) The Intermediary Drawdowns under the Relevant and Intermediary Loans constituted \nvoid transactions procured by D1-2 for the purpose of concealing the Bank’s loss \narising from the Misappropriation: Section J1  above; POC/¶¶52(1)(a)(vi.A), 62(1), \n{A1/2/34}; Reply/¶¶27-27B, 29.3, 34 {A1/25/35}.

Correct.”{Day25/106:20-24} \n(4) D1-2 further procured the transfer of the Transferred Assets to the Bank at vastly \ninflated values for the purpose of disguising the Misappropriation: Reply/¶28A \n{A1/25/48} and Sections H and N .  \n787 D1-2 were given every opportunity to make good the Bank’s loss with genuinely valuable \nassets. But they eschewed that opportunity.  \n(1) They listed out their assets in the Restructuring Plan {E12/283/36} and in D1’s \n10.7.16 guarantee letter {B4/1/34} to give the impression that they would transfer \n{AA2/15/277}\n{AA2/15/149}\n{AA2/15/277}\n{AA2/15/206}\n{AA2/15/422}\nAA2/15/402\n396 genuinely valuable assets to the Bank. Instead, they transferred dilapidated OSFs, their \nleast valuable Petrol Stations and a mishmash of real estate, all at fraudulently inflated \nvalues.  \n(2) They told the NBU and EY that the Transformation would involve replacing the old \nborrowers with substantial companies with real and transparent sources of income. \nInstead, the New Loans were granted to worthless shell companies.  \n(3) In short, D1-2 could have paid genuine compensation and made genuine “repayment” \nby transferring US$1.9bn of their truly valuable assets to the Bank; or procured the \nrepayment of the Relevant Drawdowns by their valuable operating companies (such \nas the Ferroalloy Holding companies). They elected not to do so. In those \ncircumstances, it takes some chutzpah to come to Court and contend that the Bank \nhas nevertheless been fully compensated for its loss. \n(c) Tortious loss versus book entries for debt \n788 The Repayment Defence conflates the Bank’s loss caused by D1-2’s tortious conduct with \nthe state of the account between the Bank and the Borrower as recorded in the Bank’s books. \nElimination of the recorded debts between the Borrower and the Bank in the Bank’s books \ndoes not reduce the Bank’s loss caused by the Relevant Drawdown. \n789 The Bank set out its position in the Day 2 hand-up at {AA6/2/1} and was explained in \ndetail in submissions: {Day2/74:19} - {Day2/95:10}. \n790 The Bank’s loss remains the loss caused by the Relevant Drawdowns even where the \ncontractual debts purportedly created by the Relevant Drawdowns are recorded as repaid by \nIntermediary Drawdowns, Transferred Assets or New Loans. The fact that D1-2 procured \nthe transfer of assets to the Bank at inflated values and procured the Bank to apply those \nassets to reduce the Relevant Drawdowns does not reduce the Bank’s loss, nor does it mean \nthat the Bank only has a tortious claim in respect of the Asset Transfer itself.

The fact that D1-2 procured \nthe transfer of assets to the Bank at inflated values and procured the Bank to apply those \nassets to reduce the Relevant Drawdowns does not reduce the Bank’s loss, nor does it mean \nthat the Bank only has a tortious claim in respect of the Asset Transfer itself. The same \napplies to purported repayments by Intermediary Drawdowns or New Loans: it was the \nRelevant Drawdown which caused the Bank a loss, not the steps taken to disguise the loss.  \n791 Ds have no coherent response to this.  \n792 First, they simply assert that eliminating the original shell company debt and replacing it with \nother shell company debt inevitably eliminates the tortious loss (MHKC {Day6/50:17} - \n{Day6/51:10}). That is not correct. The Borrowers’ liability in debt or restitution is not co-\nextensive with D1-2’s liability in tort. The elimination of the former does not eliminate the \nAA2/15/403\n397 latter, as the illustrations  below demonstrate. The individual who procures a fraudulent loan \nhas a liability in tort which subsists even if the borrower has settled its contractual (or \nrestitutionary) liability with the victim/lender, unless that settlement provides full \ncompensation for the tortious harm. The fact that the tortfeasor’s liability is initially \nmeasured as the same sum as that extracted under the fraudulent loan is nothing to the point \n(cf. MHKC {Day6/50:17} - {Day6/51:10}). \n793 It is important to bear in mind that the Relevant, Intermediary and New Borrowers were all \nowned and controlled by D1-2. They were used as a smokescreen through which D1-2’s \nextractions from the Bank were disguised. Ds appear to have accepted in the course of the \ntrial that the purported repayment of one loan with another is simply part of a “ paperwork \nshuffle ” (CMKC {Day7/45:19}) and (as set out above) changing loan reference numbers \n“doesn’t make any difference ”. Although they advance that proposition for a different purpose \n– apparently in support of a ‘use of funds’ analysis – it undermines any case that the \npurported repayment of a Relevant Drawdown with another fraudulent drawdown can \ngenuinely constitute a reduction in the loss caused by D1-2 procuring the Relevant \nDrawdown. \n794 Secondly, Ds say that this articulation of the Bank’s claim confuses the Bank’s ‘overall’ loss \n(caused by Relevant Drawdowns and/or Intermediary Drawdowns and/or New Loans) with \nits particular loss caused by the Relevant Drawdowns, and the Bank’s claim is for the latter \nnot the former (MHKC {Day6/20:4} - {Day6/24:21}). But it does no such thing. The \nBank’s claim is for the loss caused by the Relevant Drawdowns. Its case (which was not \nseriously disputed) is that the Intermediary Drawdowns and New Loans were means of \ndisguising that misappropriation. The question for the Court is whether those means – aimed \nat disguise – in fact extinguished the loss even though they provided no new money and no \nreal compensation. Two examples reveal the fallacy: \nExample 1 – Uniks \n(a) On 31.7.14 Uniks made a Relevant Drawdown of US$1,000 and on 1.8.14 Uniks \nmade another Relevant Drawdown of US$36.8m which is recorded in the \nBank’s records under Relevant Loan 4U14262D.  \n(b) On 6.8.14, 8.8.14, 26.8.14 and 28.8.14 Uniks made Intermediary Drawdowns \ntotalling UAH 123.8m which are recorded in the Bank’s records under \nIntermediary Loan 4U14267I {D1/177/6}. Those sums were converted to \nAA2/15/404\n398 US$9.6m and used to reduce the outstanding balance under Relevant Loan \n4U14262D.  \n(c) The Bank’s position is that the Relevant Loan Agreement and the Intermediary \nLoan Agreement were shams and are both void in Ukrainian law. The Relevant \nDrawdown (US$36.8m) and the Intermediary Drawdowns (US$9.6m) were \nboth thefts. The Intermediary Drawdowns provided no benefit or \ncompensation to the Bank; the Bank’s loss remained US$36.8m; and was simply \nrecorded under one "}

It caused the loss of US$36.8m. The \nIntermediary Loan did not provide compensation for that loss; it just disguised \nit differently. \nExample 2 - Alfatrader \n(e) Between 9.4.14 and 11.4.14 Alfatrader made UAH 128.6m in Relevant \nDrawdowns which are recorded in the Bank’s records under Relevant Loan \n4A14101I {D1/186/3} \n(f)  On 20.10.16 Dream Company drew down sums under a New Loan 4D16092G, \nentered into a purported pledge to secure Alfatrader’s obligations under \nRelevant Loan 4A14101I, and transferred UAH 156m to Alfatrader which was \nused to extinguish the Relevant Drawdown {D1/186/5}. Dream Company was \na further D1-2 shell company with no prospect of repaying its purported loan.  \n(g) The Bank’s position is that the Relevant Loan Agreement and New Loan \nAgreement are shams and void in Ukrainian law. The Relevant Drawdown and \nthe drawdown under the New Loan were both thefts; the Bank’s loss on \n21.10.16 remained UAH 128.6m just it was on 11.4.14, when the Relevant \nDrawdowns were made; the only change is in the records of the void agreements \nkept within the Bank; and the Bank is entitled to sue for the loss caused by the \nRelevant Drawdown. \n795 Thirdly, Ds say that the Intermediary Loans and the New Loans cannot be treated as if they \nnever existed because funds were in fact advanced under them and (in the case of the New \nLoans) they resulted in the repayment of USD loans with UAH loans (MHKC {Day6/40:10-\nAA2/15/405\n399 18}). But ( i) the Intermediary and New Loan Agreements are void ab initio , and are indeed \ntreated as a matter of law as if they never existed; and ( ii) the monies extracted using the \ndevice of these further void loans resulted in no compensation or benefit to the Bank.  \n796 Finally, Ds say that if the Bank is right, it would cause all sorts of problems of double \nrecovery – the Bank could claim against D1-2 for the tortious loss caused by the Relevant \nDrawdown but it could also sue the Intermediary Borrowers or New Borrowers on their \ncontractual debts / restitutionary obligations (see e.g. MHKC {Day6/57:24} - {Day6/61:5}). \nBut:  \n(1) As Mr Beketov explains, the Ukrainian courts deal with this by ensuring a claimant \ndoes not double-recover: see Beketov8/¶¶136, 140-141 {C1/1/44}; \nBeketov9/¶200(f) {C6/1/84}. The same is true of the English courts, which \nrecognise a claimant’s right to sue multiple wrongdoers on multiple causes of action, \nsubject to the rule against double recovery. \n(2) It is fanciful to suppose that the Bank is going to make any recoveries from the \nIntermediary Borrowers or New Borrowers. They are shell entities owned and \ncontrolled by D1-2. No claims have been brought against them in any event.  \n(d) No full compensation: illustrations \n797 The basic fallacy in the proposition that D1-2’s tortious liability to the Bank caused by the \nRelevant Drawdowns is extinguished if the record of the Bank-Borrower liability in the \nBank’s books is eliminated can illustrated in different ways.  \n798 First, by reference to the Asset Transfer. To take a simple example: if a Relevant Drawdown \nof US$100 is recorded in the Bank’s books as repaid by reference to an asset recorded as \nworth US$100, but the asset was in fact only worth US$10, the Bank’s loss caused by the \nrelevant "}

To take a simple example: if a Relevant Drawdown \nof US$100 is recorded in the Bank’s books as repaid by reference to an asset recorded as \nworth US$100, but the asset was in fact only worth US$10, the Bank’s loss caused by the \nrelevant drawdown cannot be said to be reduced to nil. The Bank’s loss is US$90. The record \nin the Bank’s books that the loan is repaid is irrelevant to the Bank’s true loss. The point can \nbe taken further: D1-2 could have procured the transfer of a single OSF to the Bank at a \nvalue of US$1.9bn and procured the Bank to reduce the Relevant Drawdowns to nil by \nreference to the inflated value of that single OSF. The Bank’s loss caused by the Relevant \nDrawdowns is not reduced because D1-2 have sought to conceal that loss by vastly inflating \nthe value of the Transferred Assets and eliminating the recorded debts in the Bank-Borrower \nledgers.  \nAA2/15/406\n400 799 Secondly, by reference to the Intermediary Drawdowns. To take the same example: the \nRelevant Drawdown of US$100 is recorded in the Bank’s books as repaid by reference to \nUS$100 of funds drawn down under a void Intermediary Loan. The Bank’s loss caused by \nthe Relevant Drawdown is not reduced. The Bank received no additional money. At its \nhighest, the Bank ‘received’ a worthless claim against the Intermediary Borrower in respect \nof the Intermediary Drawdown. That does not constitute full compensation for the Bank’s \nloss.  \n800 Thirdly, D1-2 could have procured all 50 Borrowers to enter into a settlement agreement \nwith the Bank by which their US$1.9bn liability under the Relevant Drawdowns was settled \nfor US$1. The Borrowers’ contractual (or restitutionary) liability to the Bank under the \nRelevant Loan Agreements would be extinguished and replaced by a new contractual liability \nof US$1 arising between Bank and Borrowers under the settlement agreement. It would be \nabsurd to assert that D1-2’s liability in tort arising from procuring the Relevant Drawdowns \nwould be only US$1, or to assert that D1-2’s liability would arise exclusively from procuring \nthe Bank to enter into the settlement agreement. They would remain liable in tort for \nprocuring the US$1.9bn loss in the first place. As the English cases demonstrate, a settlement \nagreement between the Bank and the Borrowers does not fix the Bank’s loss; a fortiori  if the \nsettlement agreement is a collusive one by which the fraudsters seek to extinguish their own \nliability.  \n801 The Bank has accepted that its loss is reduced where it has received genuine value which is \nattributable as compensation for the loss resulting from the Relevant Drawdowns. In \nparticular, it has agreed that its loss is reduced by reference to ( i) Relevant Drawdowns \npurportedly repaying Relevant Drawdowns; ( ii) the true value of the Transferred Assets that \ncan be properly attributed to the Relevant Drawdowns; ( iii) repayments of principal by \nDilorsano under the Dilorsano SPAs; ( iv) purported repayments of principal by the New \nBorrowers;627 (v) purported repayments from external sources (US$705,795) and ( vi) \npurported repayments attributable to foreign exchange gains. The contrast between those \ngenuine recoveries and the worthless transactions which underpin the Repayment Defence \ndemonstrates the fundamental flaw in the Repayment Defence.  \n \n627  Given the de minimis  amount (US$2.2m), the Bank has agreed to give credit for the full amount of purported \nrepayments of principal under New Loans that purportedly repaid Relevant Loans, rather than apportioning \nthose payments to the sums which are attributable to Relevant Drawdowns. \nAA2/15/407\n401 (4) The Bank’s right of election \n802 Mr Beketov’s very clear view is that the Bank, as a victim "}

The Bank has \nidentified its loss as caused by the Relevant Drawdowns; and (provided it does not double-\nrecover) it is entitled to be fully compensated for that loss. It might have sued on the basis \nthat different drawdowns caused it a loss, but that is a matter for the Bank as the victim, not \nDs as the fraudsters. See Beketov8/¶¶140-141 {C1/1/45}; Beketov9/¶200(b) {C6/1/82}. \n803 Mr Alyoshin contends that a claimant who is a victim of multiple successive thefts has no \nright of election at all, and (it seems) must sue on the last theft: Alyoshin2/¶¶30-40 \n{C7/1/13}. He cites no case to support this extreme position, and it runs contrary to the \nbasic Ukrainian law principles identified by Mr Beketov. He contends that if theft A was \nfrom Bank 1 and theft B was from Bank 2 and used to repay theft A, that repayment would \nextinguish the liability arising under theft A and Bank 1 would have no right of election. But \nthat is not a good analogy: in this case, all the thefts are from one victim and it is that which \ngives the victim the right to elect which one to sue upon.628 \n804 It is no answer to the Bank’s claim for Ds to contend that there were later torts by Ds, in \nthe form of the Intermediary Loans and New Loans, which either caused the same loss or \nacted to ‘replace’ the original loss. Put another way: if Ds had not engaged in the further \nfraudulent lending in the form of the Intermediary and New Loans, the Bank’s loss would \nbe that suffered as a result of the Relevant Drawdowns, and the consequences of their \nfurther fraudulent conduct stand to be ignored for the purposes of assessing loss. \n805 English law similarly allows a victim of fraud to elect how to frame their claim, as long as \nthey do not do artificially (which would be for Ds to prove and be a “ very difficult ” argument \nto sustain) As Mann J explained in Bhatia v Purkiss [2023] EWHC 775 (Ch) {M1/29.1} at \n[67]ff: \n“For the purposes of the misfeasance claim each transaction which was entered into which \nwas done as part of a fraudulent scheme was a separate breach of duty. They are each capable \nof supporting a separate damages claim, and can be aggregated, as here, to see what damages \nhave accrued in a particular period. Unless the defendant somehow seeks to say that it is \nartificial to do that because the transactions were part of a much bigger fraud which has yielded \nsome overall profit, so loss was not caused by these individual transactions (an argument \nwhich would be very difficult to run in any event), then it is appropriate to take the fraudulent \nand wrongful transactions in this case and to see what damages flow from them. Of course, \n \n628  In any event, the Bank does not accept the premise. In Mr Alyoshin’s example (or, more likely, an example \ndrafted for him) Bank 2 might well have a claim against Bank 1, and Bank 1 might then have claims in respect \nof both thefts A and/or B.  \nAA2/15/408\n402 the defendant in this case is not alleging some wider fraud which protects him from the \nconsequences of the narrower one, so the point does not arise.” \n806 It is correct that the Bank is not claiming for a “ bigger fraud ” (cf. MHKC {Day6/56:19-20}). \nBut the Bank is entitled to identify the wrongdoing it wish to claim in respect of and claim \nin respect of that. Here it claims in respect of the loss to it caused by 270 fraudulent Relevant \nDrawdo"}
{"start": 1113000, "text": "t \nof both thefts A and/or B.  \nAA2/15/408\n402 the defendant in this case is not alleging some wider fraud which protects him from the \nconsequences of the narrower one, so the point does not arise.” \n806 It is correct that the Bank is not claiming for a “ bigger fraud ” (cf. MHKC {Day6/56:19-20}). \nBut the Bank is entitled to identify the wrongdoing it wish to claim in respect of and claim \nin respect of that. Here it claims in respect of the loss to it caused by 270 fraudulent Relevant \nDrawdowns, and then concealed by the further fraudulent Intermediary Loans and New \nLoans. And Ds for their part have made no attempt at all to plead and prove some “ much \nbigger fraud ” under which they can show that the loss was somehow lower than the loss the \nBank has identified and shown was caused by the Misappropriation. \n807 Lastly if it were right that the victim of a fraud such as the present had no right of election \nthen, particularly in cases such as this (where all parties to the fraud were under common \nownership and control when the fraudulent scheme was implemented and where the loss \nwas intentionally covered up by means of further fraudulent devices), the right of election \nwould effectively be in the hands of the fraudsters. It would be open to them to engineer \nthe fraud (by replacing valuable companies with shell companies, for example) in order to \npredetermine in whose hands the “ hot potato ” of loss ends up, irrespective of how the scheme \nwas carried out, and using what entities. This would be an extraordinarily unjust outcome, \nand (as Mr Beketov explained) does not represent Ukrainian law. \n(5) Repayment Defence: relevant figures \n808 New Loan purported repayments. As explained above, the relevant figures vary depending \non the methodology used to identify ultimate sources of repayment (see \nThompson1/¶¶4.72-4.73 {D1/1/135} and Thompson2/¶4.27 {D1/347/33}). Depending \non the approach taken, the figures is between approximately US$660m and US$1.05bn (see \nthe Loss Matrix {D1/521P}).  \n809 Credit Value v true value. Ds’ Repayment Defence alleges that c. US$648m of Relevant \nDrawdowns were repaid by the Credit Values of the Transferred Assets. But if the Bank is \nonly required to reduce its loss by reference to the true value of the Transferred Assets, there \nwill be c. US$590m in Relevant Drawdowns which were not repaid ( i.e. the delta between \nthe Credit Values and the true values: the precise figure depends on the methodology used \nto identify repayments, the starting point for the Bank’s loss, and the value of the assets, but \nsee Bank Opening/¶¶589-593 {AA2/1/229}).  \n810 Source not identified. Depending on the methodology applied, there are c. US$67-200m+ in \nrepayments for which the source has not been identified (see the Loss Matrix {D1/521P}). \nAA2/15/409\n403 The burden of proof is on Ds to show that the loss caused by the Relevant Drawdowns has \nbeen reduced. If Ds are unable to identify the source of the payments which were used to \nreduce the Relevant Drawdowns, the Bank’s loss should not be reduced.  \nM5 THE USE OF FUNDS DEFENCE  \n(1) Overview \n811 As already outlined, the answer to the Use of Funds Defence is a short one. The experts \nagree that the Use of Funds Defence is not available as a matter of Ukrainian law.629 In \naddition, there is no real dispute that the Use of Funds Defence is also bad as matter of \nEnglish law. As Mr Howard KC accepted in opening “ the English case law has set itself against \nthe use of funds analysis… ” {Day6/74:18-19}. That was a realistic concession given the \nconclusion in NBT v Yurov.  \n812 In the remainder of this section, we address for completeness certain other features of the \nUse of Funds Defence and issues which have been addressed during the trial regarding it. \nWe do so in particular because although it does not provide Ds with any Defence, it is \nstriking that Use of Funds is still unable to account for a very substantial part of the \nmisappropriated monie"}
{"start": 1116500, "text": "use of funds analysis… ” {Day6/74:18-19}. That was a realistic concession given the \nconclusion in NBT v Yurov.  \n812 In the remainder of this section, we address for completeness certain other features of the \nUse of Funds Defence and issues which have been addressed during the trial regarding it. \nWe do so in particular because although it does not provide Ds with any Defence, it is \nstriking that Use of Funds is still unable to account for a very substantial part of the \nmisappropriated monies. In addition, the material relating to it provides some insight into \nthe ways in which D1-2 laundered the monies misappropriated via the Relevant Drawdowns.  \n(2) Basic facts \n813 There is substantial common ground on the basic facts relating to Use of Funds. \n814 There is no dispute that if the Relevant Drawdowns are followed using Exact Matching, \nUS$1.418bn630 was used to repay existing debts (or purported debts) to the Bank owed by \nthe Borrowers, Intermediary Borrowers and 193 borrowers: AccountancyJR2/¶3.1.1 \n{D4/2/8}. And, if Mr Davidson’s “ Bridging Loan Methodology ” is accepted, a further \nUS$306m631 can be traced by a combination of “ bridging loans ” and Exact Matching into \nfurther repayments of other liabilities: ibid.  \n815 There is no dispute that there are contemporary documents (including Skypes and certain \nentries in the Gurieva Spreadsheet) which are consistent with the Exact Matching / Funds \nFlow analysis (see Section F ). Money does not move in a vacuum, and someone was clearly \n \n629  UkrJR/¶45.2 {C5/1/20}. \n630  Including US$45.8m of interest payments. \n631  Including US$690,363 of interest payments \n{AA2/15/149}\nAA2/15/410\n404 directing the movement of money as between the numerous D1-2 shell companies which \nfeature in this case.  \n816 There is also no dispute that some of the Davidson Payment Chains are fiendishly \ncomplicated and involved moving money through a vast web of companies, in a short period \nof time, for no commercial purpose. See for example the Ortika/Real Standard payment \nchains at {D2/9/320-327}. Mr Thompson’s evidence is that the movement of funds in this \nway has all the hallmarks of money laundering (Thompson2/¶5.34 {D1/347/46}). \n817 Nobody has offered an explanation for the movement of money in this way. This is despite \nMr Howard KC’s acceptance in July 2018 that “ obviously, if the matter ever goes to trial one would \nneed to explain what was going on and why this was being done and so on, whether there was any dishonest \nintent ” {G3/12/8} (28:2-5), and despite the Court of Appeal criticising the Ds as long ago \nas 2019 for having not “proffered any explanation for the transactions in question or sought to explain \ntheir commercial rationale, if any” {A5/12/5}, [21]. Indeed, when showing the Davidson \nPayment Chains to Mr Thompson in XX, the premise of Mr Howard KC’s questioning was \nthat the witness and the Court should “ leave aside the propriety of all of this ” when considering \nthe flow of funds: MHKC {Day23/54:16-17}. However “ the propriety of all of this ”, in a fraud \ncase, matters a great deal, and the fact that D1 is driven to say it should be ignored speaks \nvolumes. \n(3) Bridging Loans \n818 As set out above, US$1.412bn of the US$2.3bn in Relevant Drawdowns can be followed to \nloan repayments using Exact Matching. That leaves around c. US$900m untraced. In order \nto increase the “ Claimed Credit ” which D1 might apply to reduce the loss caused by the \nRelevant Drawdowns, Mr Davidson created a bespoke tracing methodology which he called \n“Bridging Loans ”, in order to trace a further US$306m of Relevant Drawdowns into loan \nrepayments to the Bank.  \n819 The Bridging Loan Transaction Chains are best described by reference to an example (see \nan extract from Thompson1/App. 3-2-5-1 (Transmoloko) {D1/16/2} below: \nAA2/15/411\n405  \n \n820 Mr Davidson describes the UAH 141.5m of Relevant Drawdowns on 8.4.14 as a “ bridging \nloan” which, applying the Bridging Loan Methodology, "}

He accepts that, on a Funds Flow/Exact Matching analysis, the UAH \n141.5m Relevant Drawdown did not repay itself but was (consistent with Mr Thompson’s \nanalysis) converted into USD and used to fund half of the US$24.2m prepayment from \nTransmoloko to Stefford on 10.4.14: see {Day25/71:20} - {Day25/72:6}.632 He also accepts \nthat there is nothing in the transactional data, or any contemporaneous documents, which \nuses the term “ bridging loan ”: the label is his own {Day25/73:9-24}.  \n821 Mr Davidson’s justification for adopting this methodology is that there is a “ consistent pattern \nof transactions ” in the data which consists of intra-day cycles of returns of prepayments and \nsubsequent prepayments between Borrowers and Suppliers, in which the return of \nprepayment under one Supply Agreement and subsequent prepayment under a different \nSupply Agreement are in the same USD sum. The pattern is disrupted when the Borrower \nis required to convert 50% of the return of prepayment into UAH and there was a delay in \nthen converting it back into USD such that the Borrower could fund the next prepayment \nwith the proceeds of the earlier return of prepayment. In order to ensure the Borrower had \nfunds on hand to make the next prepayment in the same USD sum as the previous return \nof prepayment, the Borrower made a drawdown in advance and converted it into USD in \norder to fund the next prepayment. See Davidson1/¶5.32 {D2/1/32}; Davidson XX \n{Day25/79:8} - {Day25/80:25}; MHKC {Day24/3:11} - {Day24/4:14}.  \n \n632  Mr Thompson’s evidence is that the US$24.2m prepayment from Transmoloko to Stefford can be traced back \nto Transmoloko as a return of prepayment using the Bank’s Methodology {D1/16/2} or to Fiastra Trading \nby applying Exact Matching: see Thompson1/¶5.91 {D1/1/186}. \nAA2/15/412\n406 822 Even were the Use of Funds Defence to be available in principle (which the experts \nessentially agree it is not), it should nevertheless reject Mr Davidson’s Bridging Loan \nTransaction Chains as unprincipled and self-serving.  \n(1) Mr Davidson accepts that the Bridging Loan methodology is not consistent with Exact \nMatching. (Mr Thompson explains this in detail in Thompson2/¶5.63 ff \n{D1/347/55}). \n(2) The methodology (and indeed the “ bridging loan ” label) is inconsistent with the \ntransactional narratives. In the Transmoloko example above, the 8.4.14 Relevant \nDrawdown was converted into USD and the conversion was justified by reference to \nthe supply agreement TM-0804-2014 ( i.e. the supply agreement under which the \n10.4.14 prepayment was made): see {D1/17P/1} (row 14), {K7-C/10}). So not only \ndoes the bridging loan analysis ignore the flow of funds, it ignores the stated purpose \nfor which the Relevant Drawdown was made and converted to USD. It is founded on \nnothing more than the impugned opinion of a dishonest expert seeking to advocate \nfor a result favourable to his client.  \n(3) It has been adopted for those Relevant Drawdowns where Mr Davidson was simply \nunable to trace or follow the funds back to the Bank applying Exact Matching. In \norder words, it is a bespoke methodology which has been manufactured for the sole \npurpose of generating an additional “ Claimed Credit ” for Ds. Mr Davidson had no good \nanswer for why he had adopted the Bridging Loan methodology for certain \ntransactions but not for others (Davidson XX {Day25/76:16} - {Day25/79:7}).  \n(4) The untraced US$557m \n823 Mr "}

Mr Davidson had no good \nanswer for why he had adopted the Bridging Loan methodology for certain \ntransactions but not for others (Davidson XX {Day25/76:16} - {Day25/79:7}).  \n(4) The untraced US$557m \n823 Mr Davidson has not followed or traced (using Exact Matching or Bridging Loan \nMethodology) US$557m of Relevant Drawdowns: AccountancyJR/3.2.1 {D4/1/5}. Mr \nSteadman has not looked at the transactions which Mr Davidson could not trace: \n{Day26/26:15-20}. Accordingly, even if the Use of Funds Defence is available, the Bank’s \nloss could never be reduced by reference to a sum the Ds are unable to trace into loan \nrepayments.  \n824 The burden of proof here is on Ds: “ Where a defendant in a deceit claim, or in a negligence claim, \ncontends that the claimant must give credit against its losses for financial benefits which are alleged to have \nresulted from the tort, the evidential burden rests on the  defendant to show that the claimant has received the \nbenefit ”: Cheltenham BC v Laird [2009] EWHC 1253 (QB) at [561] {M1/13/106}. \nAA2/15/413\n407 825 Furthermore:  \n(1) At least four of the Relevant Drawdowns which Mr Davidson failed to trace can be \nfollowed on an Exact Matching basis ( i) to D2’s current account, ( ii) to the purchase \nof a private jet for D1633 and ( iii) to the repayment of ZFP’s debts: see \nThompson2/5.83-5.90 {D1/347/59}.634 \n(2) In certain cases, Relevant Drawdowns can be followed using Exact Matching to \ncompanies such as Divot Enterprises (see e.g {D1/1/197}). Divot made very large \npayments between 2013 and 2016 to Grizal, D2’s treasury company: see {K7-D/1P}. \n(3) Mr Davidson’s evidence on the limitation of his Tracing Exercise was he was “ only \ninterested ” in money that went back to the Bank, and if he had “ discovered it had in fact \ngone somewhere else, that wasn’t included ” {Day25/67:15-21} \n(4) He further confirmed that he had been “ unable to draw any conclusions about who had \nbenefited from those monies  [sc. the US$557m ]” {Day25/88:3-6}.  \n(5) Mr Steadman appeared to accept that his loan book analysis doesn’t tell the Court \nanything about the “ unfollowed money ”: Steadman XX {Day26/58:16} - {Day26/59:9}.  \n(6) The Lafferty Spreadsheet Team traced at least US$452m through “ Break Points ” and \n“Compensation Payments ” into loan repayments by companies in which D1-2 had \nsignificant interests: see {D1/281.1} and the Bank’s Day 17 hand-up at {AA6/18/1}. \n(7) The fact that money could not be easily followed or traced using Exact Matching is \nthe intended consequence of Ds’ money laundering scheme. The splitting and \nlayering635 of transfers through offshore accounts for no commercial purpose are \nhallmarks of money-laundering, the purpose of which is “ to hide the origins and ultimate \nuse of money which has been unlawfully obtained ” (as Mr Steadman agreed: see \n{Day26/12:23} - {Day26/13:2}).  \n \n633  US$16.5m of the Prominmet Relevant Drawdown is traced to High Wings Aviation (a wholly-owned D1 \ncompany: see {J1/3/12}). The transactional data shows payments of US$16.6m from High Wings Aviation to \nDa Gama’s account with Deutsche Bank with the description “ payment as per aircraft purchase and sale agreement dd \n03.04.14 ” {D1/418} (rows 43 and 45, coloured orange). The sale agreement between Da Gama and High \nWings Aviation for the sale and purchase of a Bombardier private aircraft for US$16.5m is at {E3/97.1}.  \n634  Although they do not feature anywhere in his reports, Mr Davidson confirmed that these tracing exercises \nwere correct: {Day25/86:19} - {Day25/87:6}  \n635  Both agreed hallmarks of money-laundering: see Steadman XX {Day26/22:22} - {Day26/26:20}.  \nAA2/15/414\n408 (8) In those circumstances, i"}

Further, the Use of Funds \nanalysis which has been undertaken is itself incomplete and can only ever account for \nUS$1.412bn of the Relevant Drawdowns, and still leaves a c. US$863m unaccounted for.  \nM6 MORTON ’S FORK – LOSS BEFORE OR AFTER , BUT NOT IN THE ‘MIDDLE ’ \n827 Ds’ position is that “ either there is repayment and therefore defence or there is effectively restitution because \nthere is circling back ” (CMKC {Day7/76:21-23}) and “ it’s not possible coherently to reject the \nrepayment defence at all but, if it were, you couldn’t reject the use of funds defence ” (MHKC {Day6/44:1-\n4}. The same point is made by Ds when they contend that the Bank cannot have suffered a \nloss caused by transactions in the ‘middle’ of a bigger fraudulent ‘loan recycling’ scheme, and \nthat the Bank’s loss is either the first loan or the last loan ( i.e. the New Loans).  \n828 Contrary to Ds’ position, the Repayment Defence and Use of Funds Defence are not \neither/or defences, the rejection of one necessitating the adoption of the other. They are \nsimply two bad, unsustainable and in the end desperate attempts to avoid liability for a fraud \nto which Ds have no answer on the substance:  \n(1) Under Ukrainian law, as under English law, the Bank as the victim of fraud can elect \nwhat wrongdoing to claim on and how to frame its claim. The Bank has here claimed \nin respect of the Misappropriation, involving as it did extraction of the Bank’s monies \nthrough the Relevant Drawdowns. \n(2) No Defendant has taken on the “ very difficult ” argument and sought to show that the \nRelevant Drawdowns were part of a “ much bigger fraud ” under which the loss was \nsomehow less. \n(3) If, as it can, the Bank can show that the Relevant Drawdowns were caused by Ds’ \nunlawful conduct, then the Bank is entitled to full compensation for the harm caused \nby the Relevant Drawdowns.  \n(4) As a matter of Ukrainian law, which is the same as English law on this point, the fact \nthat some of the Relevant Drawdowns were used to reduce other purported \nindebtedness does not reduce the Bank’s loss: see above.  \nAA2/15/415\n409 (5) Accordingly, the starting point is that the Bank suffered a loss of US$2.3bn as a result \nof the Relevant Drawdowns and it is irrelevant that those funds can be followed on \nan Exact Matching basis “back to the Bank” to pay off other liabilities.  \n(6) The Court must then consider whether the Bank has been fully compensated for the \nharm caused by the Relevant Drawdowns as a result of the purported repayments \nfunded by the further fraudulent steps taken to disguise the Misappropriation, i.e. \nIntermediary Loans, New Loans and Asset Transfer. For the reasons given above, the \nanswer (with limited exceptions arising from the true value of the Transferred Assets) \nis ‘no’. The Bank’s loss is not reduced where a Relevant Drawdown is purportedly \nrepaid using funds from a void Intermediary or New Loan granted to a shell-company \nIntermediary or New Borrower, nor by the exercise of recording as a credit in the \nBank’s books the fraudulently inflated value of an asset. \n(7) Given that the starting point for the Bank’s claim is the US$1.9bn loss resulting from \nthe"}

The Bank’s claim is not for an \naccounting loss, or for the loss represented by the impairment of the New Loans in its 2016 \nfinancial statements (AccountancyJR2/¶6.4 {D4/2/18}). Given the irrelevance of this issue, \nthe Bank limits its submissions to the following:  \n(1) The Bank’s 2014 and 2015 financial statements record impairment charges against the \nBank’s corporate loan book of c. 10% of the total value of the corporate loan portfolio \n(see 2014 FS Note 10 {K1/4/34} and 2015 FS Note 10 {K1/5/36}) but there is no \nevidence that the impairments relate to the Relevant Loans. Those financial statements \nwere compiled while the Bank was under D1-2’s control. The 2014 FS received an \nAA2/15/416\n410 unqualified audit opinion from PwC. We have addressed in Section F  above how \nPwC was systematically misled e.g. as to the value of security for the corporate loan \nportfolio and the related party status of the corporate borrowers. The Bank is suing \nPwC in Cyprus in respect of its negligent audit work in this period. In the \ncircumstances, the Court can place no reliance on the inclusion or exclusion from \nthose financial statements of impairment charges in respect of loans.  \n(2) The Bank’s 2016 financial statements, issued in May 2017, state the value of the New \nLoans at UAH 137bn and recognise an impairment of UAH 135bn under the New \nLoans {K1/6/34}. EY, the Bank’s new auditors, issued a disclaimer of opinion in \nrespect of the impairment charge:  “We were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit \nevidence about the period this impairment loss relates to .” {K1/6/3}. We address in Section \nL1 the difficulties the Bank’s new management faced in unravelling the fraudulent \nconduct which had been rife at the Bank before nationalisation. The fact that the New \nLoans were likely to be worthless was tolerably clear to the new management by mid-\n2017; what was less clear was the losses those New Loans had been issued to conceal \n(see Thompson2/¶¶6.63-6.64 {D1/347/91}).  \n(3) In the Bank’s 2018 financial statements it restated its 2016 balance sheet but did not \nsubstantially change the New Loans impairment charge {K1/6.3/56}.  \n(4) Mr Thompson explains by reference to IAS8 why the post-nationalisation discovery \nthat the Relevant Loans were worthless shams did not require the Bank to re-issue or \nre-state its 2014/2015 balance sheets or cash flow (Thompson2/¶6.66 \n{D1/347/92}).636 \n(5) So, the Bank’s financial statements are not inconsistent with the loss claimed in these \nproceedings, and are in any event irrelevant to the issues the Court needs to consider.  \n(6) Equally, the fact that the Bank’s Methodology does not reveal an accounting loss (a \npoint which Mr Thompson accep"}

The earliest prior period presented in the Bank’s 2018 Financial \nStatements was the year ended 31 December 2017, the opening balances for which were the closing balances for the year ended 31 \nDecember 2016. Since the Bank had already recognised the loss by 31 December 2016 (albeit in respect of the New Loans), the \nloss would already be present in the opening balances for the year ended 31 December 2017, and therefore no further adjustment \nwould be required. ” \n{AA2/15/149}\n{AA2/15/303}\nAA2/15/417\n411 (2) The Bank’s Methodology, the Gurieva Spreadsheet and clearing transactions \n831 The Gurieva Spreadsheet is at {E18/213P}. In summary, it shows the following:  \n(1) The Borrowers. Column D lists the 46 Ukrainian Borrowers who made the \nUnreturned Prepayments (and column B groups the Borrowers by “ business ” e.g. \n“Ferrotraders ” etc.: see Section G above).  \n(2) Debts. Columns E-R give details of the Borrowers’ debts to the Bank. Column E lists \nthe “ debt on the principal of the loan, UAH equivalent ” totalling UAH 28.82bn (which is \napproximately US$1.85bn, applying the exchange rate in cell D1). The debts are then \nbroken down so as to show total debt (Column F – this is the principal debt under \nthe Borrowers’ loans and the indexed commission fees637 due under the UAH \ndenominated loans identified in Column O); a breakdown by currency; interest etc.  \n(3) Unreturned Prepayments. Columns Z – AE identify the Unreturned Prepayments \nmade by the Borrowers to D3-8, including the amount of each Unreturned \nPrepayment; the date; the recipient; and the Relevant Supply Agreement under which \nthe Unreturned Prepayment was made. The total Unreturned Prepayments is \nUS$1,911,877,385.  \n(4) “Refund of the said prepayment”. Columns AI – AM appear under the heading “ refund \nof the said prepayment ”. The majority of the entries in these columns give details of the \nprepayment/return of prepayment which preceded the Unreturned Prepayment with \nthe entry in Column AI reading “ to the same ”. In other words, these columns record \nthe transaction which preceded the Unreturned Prepayment in the cycle of payments \nbetween Borrowers and Suppliers (as Mr Davidson put it “ it’s saying where the money came \nin” {Day25/64:20}) and they are consistent with the Bank’s case on how the \nUnreturned Prepayments were funded. \n(5) However, these columns contain a number of data entries which are either clear errors, \nor are inconsistent with that understanding of the document:  \n(6) If columns AI-AM are recording the previous cycle of prepayment/return of \nprepayment, in cases where the Bank’s case is that the Unreturned Prepayment was \nfunded directly by a Relevant Drawdown (without any previous cycle), Columns AI – \n \n637  This is the clause A.10 fee which appears in the UAH denominated loans e.g. at {F2/38}.

Instead, in six cases,638 columns AI – AM record the subsequent \nuse of the Unreturned Prepayment on a Funds Flow basis. For example, cells 82AI-\nAM and 83AI-AM appear to show the Unreturned Prepayment from Uniks to \nTeamtrend being used to fund returns of prepayment to Forsa and Real Standart \n(which is what happened on a Funds Flow basis). These six examples (out of 56 \nUnreturned Prepayments) all feature in D2 Opening/Sch. 2 {AA4/3/1}. In XX they \nwere described by CMKC as ‘type 1’ transactions. \n(7) In four cases, columns AI – AM simply read “ repayment of loans to KF ” (rows 27, 28, 39 \nand 40). “ KF” is likely a reference to the Cyprus Branch. These are the Unreturned \nPrepayments to D6-8. These Unreturned Prepayments were funded directly by \nRelevant Drawdowns totalling US$102m, and Mr Davidson has not been able to trace \nUS$100m these Relevant Drawdowns.  \n(8) Columns AI – AM contain data entry errors, including: ( i) in 10 entries the same \ncontract details of the same supply agreement (“ Vialint TOV return prepmyt for contr. \n1205CV/2 ”) were erroneously copied and pasted (D2 accepts this is a data entry error: \n{Day24/68:2-3}, {Day24/91:7-15}) and ( ii) 5 further entries contain other copy-and-\npaste errors639 or formula errors.640 \n(9) Security. Cells AN-AQ list the Share Pledges purportedly granted as security for the \nBorrowers’ loans over D1-2’s companies. \n(10) Other columns. There are other entries in the Gurieva Spreadsheet which are not \neasily explained. For example, column AF is entitled “ difference between the principal of the \nloan today and the prepayment amount ” and is calculated as the difference between the \nBorrower’s debt in UAH (column E) and the Unreturned Prepayment in UAH \n(column AC). Column W is entitled “ additional loan availability ” which may be a record \nof the headroom on the Borrowers’ loan facilities. But it is unclear why Gurieva was \nperforming these calculations, or why they were relevant in November 2014. \n \n638  Dorteks (rows 8-9), Techspets (row 20), Transmoloko (row 66), Intorno (row 72), Empire (row 81), Uniks \n(rows 82-83).  \n639  Rows 47-48. Cells AI47 to AM47 should be blank because the Unreturned Prepayment was funded directly. \nThe issue with row 48 is that cell AJ48 is missing the relevant payment description (all of the other details are \nconsistent with the Bank’s case). These issues are connected. First, the contents of AJ47 should be in AJ48. \nThis is the ‘Inkom Copy-and-Paste Error’. Secondly, columns AI to AM in row 47 should be blank. We can \nexplain why columns AI to AL in row 47 have content because of the Inkom Copy-and-Paste Error. Cell \nAM47 has content because it contains a formula (“ =AB47 ”) which means that the cell reflects the contents of \ncell AB47, i.e. the amount of the Unreturned Prepayment. This is the ‘Use of Formula Error’. \n640  Cells AM14, AM17, AM75 and AM80 all suffer from the Use of Formula Error.  \nAA2/15/419\n413 832 The Gurieva Spreadsheet is clear evidence that there was a co-ordinated scheme by which \nthe Borrowers took purported loans from the Bank and used those funds to make \nUnreturned Prepayments to D3-8 and that all the companies involved were under common \ncontrol.

It is also good evidence (in the majority of cases) that the Unreturned Prepayments \nwere the final transaction in a cycle of prepayments and returns of prepayment.  \n833 But there is no clear explanation for all of the data recorded in the spreadsheet, and it was \nunderstandable that Mr Thompson had “ struggled to make head or tail ” of column AJ (see \nThompson XX {Day24/69:7-9}. D1-2 could clearly have called Gurieva, the captain of D1’s \nLafferty Spreadsheet team, as a witness to explain the content of the spreadsheet; why she \ncompiled it; and what it was intended to record (including in columns AI – AM). They chose \nnot to do so. The Court should infer that such choice was made because D1-2 knew that, if \nshe gave truthful evidence, that evidence would be supportive of the Bank’s case.  \n834 D2’s case theory – advanced in the absence of any evidence whatsoever – appears to be that \n(i) where the Unreturned Prepayment was funded directly by a Relevant Drawdown (‘type \n1’ cases) the Gurieva Spreadsheet records the subsequent use of the Unreturned Prepayment \nin columns AI to AM and ( ii) in all other cases (‘type 2’ cases), the Unreturned Prepayment \nwas funded by an intra-day overdraft by which D3-8 made the previous return of \nprepayment to the Borrower by drawing down on an overdraft facility, and the effect of the \nUnreturned Prepayment by the Borrower to D3-8 was to repay the overdraft (see CMKC \n{Day24/75:7-25}). In type 2 cases, it is said that the “ funds flow goes…against the grain of the \nGurieva spreadsheet because the refund actually funds the prepayment ” (CMKC {Day24/85:16-18}). \nAs to that theory:  \n(1) Type 1 cases. The Bank accepts that in six of the type 1 cases, the Gurieva Spreadsheet \ndoes record the subsequent use of the Unreturned Prepayment on a Funds Flow basis. \nBut this theory does not work for the Unreturned Prepayments to D6-8 (the “ repayment \nof loans in KF ” entries).  \n(2) Type 2 cases. D2’s position in these transactions is a resurrection of what Mr Lafferty \ndescribed as “ clearing transactions ” (Lafferty2/¶¶48.1-48.2 {H2/8/13}) and is addressed \nin Thompson1/¶5.234 ff {D1/1/261}. Mr Lafferty’s evidence was that “ Clearing was a \nfacility offered by the Bank from 2010…this allowed two customers of the Bank to resolve mutual \nindebtedness without either having sufficient funds in their account to transfer to the other…As a \nresult of a clearing transaction, the account of the customers who initiates the process becomes overdrawn \nwithin one banking day…The payments then flow through the chain of customer accounts with the \nAA2/15/420\n414 Bank as specified in the Bank’s Clearing Register. At the end of the chain, the overdrawn balance \non the initiating customer’s account is cleared off .” As to that:  \n(a) There is no evidence from any witness as to the existence of this purported \n“clearing ” service offered by the Bank. \n(b) The Gurieva Spreadsheet makes no reference to ‘clearing’.  \n(c) Mr Lafferty identified 32 Unreturned Prepayments as ‘clearing’ transactions, as \nagainst 67 Unreturned Prepayments that were not directly funded \n{D1/328P}.641 D2 cross-examined Mr Thompson on the false basis that all of \nthe Unreturned Prepayments which were not directly funded ( i.e. all of the “ type \n2” cases) were “ clearing transactions ” i.e. intra-day overdraft transactions (see \nCMKC {Day24/75:9-13}, {Day24/92:19-25}642). Mr Davidson agreed that this \nwas a bad point: “ there are examples of [intra-day overdraft funding ]. There are other \nexamples where money has seemed to come in fr"}
{"start": 1144500, "text": "ed Prepayments that were not directly funded \n{D1/328P}.641 D2 cross-examined Mr Thompson on the false basis that all of \nthe Unreturned Prepayments which were not directly funded ( i.e. all of the “ type \n2” cases) were “ clearing transactions ” i.e. intra-day overdraft transactions (see \nCMKC {Day24/75:9-13}, {Day24/92:19-25}642). Mr Davidson agreed that this \nwas a bad point: “ there are examples of [intra-day overdraft funding ]. There are other \nexamples where money has seemed to come in from somewhere else ” (Davidson XX \n{Day25/66:2-4}).  \n(d) D3-8 make no reference to clearing or overdrafts. Their case is that they paid \non all the Unreturned Prepayments “ almost immediately ” “to bank accounts of [their \nAlleged Principal ] or third parties identified by [their Alleged Principal ]”: D3-8Def/¶18 \n{A1/20/8} and Annex D {A1/24/2}. \n(e) In any event, even if the return of prepayment and the subsequent Unreturned \nPrepayment were ‘clearing transactions’, that only serves to support the Bank’s \ncase that the return of prepayment and subsequent Unreturned Prepayment \nwere transactionally linked.  \n835 D2 sought to draw the conclusion from the Gurieva Spreadsheet that “ of the 1.911 \nprepayments, 1.811 immediately cycled back to the Bank ” (CMKC {Day24/67:20-21}). The \ndocument simply does not support that conclusion because the US$1.811bn figure recorded \nin column AM is a figure which is predominantly the sum of previous returns of prepayment \nand not the subsequent use of the Unreturned Prepayment. Furthermore, none of the \n \n641  There are a total of 82 transactions constituting the Unreturned Prepayments; 15 were directly funded; and 67 \nwere indirectly funded. In {D1/328P}, Mr Lafferty’s ‘clearing transactions’ are those with a reference number \nin column C. \n642  Indeed, this entire XX of Mr Thompson took place without him being referred to that part of his 1st Report \nin which he addressed clearing transactions.  \nAA2/15/421\n415 forensic accountants have traced the entirety of the Unreturned Prepayments “ back to the \nBank ” in that way.  \n(3) Indicia of Misappropriation \n836 As set out above, Mr Steadman’s approach to this topic was one-sided, and ignored the \nbrazenly obvious indicia of misappropriation which are the characteristics of this case. His \nanalysis of the purported “indicia of misappropriation” should be ignored.  \n837 Equally irrelevant is the proposition that D1 and D2 did not directly receive any part of the \nUnreturned Prepayments (a point Mr Thompson erroneously accepted towards the end of \na second day of XX: {Day24/103:5-9}). The Unreturned Prepayments were received by D3-\n8 which are entities owned and controlled by D1 and D2: the fact that the money did not \nimmediately hit their personal bank accounts is unsurprising, given the money-laundering \nsystem they had in place. As set out in Section F3 , D1-2 clearly did benefit from the \nMisappropriation.  \n838 Mr Thompson was cross-examined on the false basis that “ if one looks at the borrowers and the \ntotals [i.e. total lending ], there’s no increase in the borrowers so nobody has walked away with 1.9 billion? ” \n{Day24/106:22-25}. In fact, there was a substantial increase in the lending to the Borrowers \nover the relevant period (as Mr Steadman agreed); and the Borrowers’ overall indebtedness \nrecorded in the Bank’s books as at September 2014 was c. US$1.8bn (D1’s pleaded figure is \nUAH 7bn and US$1.02bn outstanding as at 10.9.14 {A1/9/5}; Gurieva’s figure in her \nspreadsheet as at 19.11.14 was UAH 28bn or c.

We cross-refer to those \nsubmissions below in relation to points which were not disputed during XX. The aim of this \nsection is, instead, to focus on the key fault lines between the parties. \n{AA2/15/166}\nAA2/15/422\n416 840 A summary of the Credit Values and the parties’ valuations is at {AA2/5/3}.643 We address \nthe assets in the following order: ( i) Petrol Stations (UAH 6.6bn dispute), ( ii) OSFs (UAH \n2bn dispute), ( iii) real estate (UAH 2bn dispute, 70% of which concerns the Stadium), and \n(iv) aircraft (US$15m dispute). In terms of a roadmap: \n(1) Section N2  briefly addresses the four valuation experts. \n(2) Section N3 deals with the Petrol Stations. \n(3) Section N4  deals with OSFs.  \n(4) Section N5 addresses the Real Estate.  \n(5) Section N6  addresses the Aircraft. \nN2 THE VALUATION EXPERTS  \n841 The Court heard evidence from Mark Bezant  (Petrol Stations, OSFs, Dnipro and Kyiv \nOffices, Hotels Zirka and Mir), Paul Thomas  (Stadium, Training Centre and Airfield) and \nOlga Razzhivina  (Aircraft) on behalf of the Bank; and from Brent Kaczmarek  (all assets \nother than Aircraft) and Philip Seymour  (Aircraft) on behalf of D1. \n(1) Mark Bezant. Mr Bezant has vast experience in assisting Courts on valuation issues. \nHe has produced thorough reports and – despite repeated but baseless insinuations to \nthe contrary644 – gave independent evidence on which the Court can safely rely. Mr \nBezant was frank about the limitations and uncertainties inherent in his valuations due \nto the lack of contemporaneous material (which, of course, should have been provided \nby D1-2 as the owners of the Transferred Assets). \n(2) Paul Thomas. Mr Thomas candidly accepted the criticism of him that had been made \nby this Court in previous proceedings {Day21/36:9-18} and (having learned from that \nexperience) gave measured and focussed answers. Unlike Mr Kaczmarek, he did not \nblindly accept the NBU’s so-called “ verified ” values; and D1’s challenge of Mr Thomas \nin relation to the Stadium and Training Centre proceeded on a misunderstanding of \nthe task at hand, viz. to ascertain the purchase price that a hypothetical and willing \nbuyer would pay to a hypothetical and willing seller – instead attributing to them \nidiosyncratic characteristics that were said vastly to inflate the valuations. \n \n643  D1’s valuation of the Aircraft has increased by c. US$2m, having accepted Ms Razzhivina’s valuations for three \nof the Boeing Aircraft on Day 18. \n644  E.g. {Day19/53:22-24}: “ treating you as an independent, objective expert, if you’re prepared to be so treated ”; \n{Day19/143:16-22}: “… if we’re being independent and objective - a big ‘if’ - but if one is being independent and objective… ”. \n{AA2/15/423}\n{AA2/15/425}\n{AA2/15/451}\n{AA2/15/463}\n{AA2/15/480}\nAA2/15/423\n417 (3) Olga Razzhivina. Ms Razzhivina was a polite, knowledgeable and confident witness \nwho engaged with D1’s XX. Contrary to what was put to her, she did not “ abuse” her \ndata points (indeed, she gave information about them and weighted them, unlike Mr \nSeymour). \n(4) Brent Kaczmarek. Mr Kaczmarek demonstrated time and again that he was not an \nindependent expert seeking to assist the Court but a ‘hired gun’ seeking to defend \nabsurdly high valuations. Examples of this stance arose: ( i) in relation to two sets of \nPetrol Station fuel volume data from 2016 (which Mr Kaczmarek was eventually \nforced to concede were “ flatly inconsistent ” with each other {Day21/96:3}), ( ii) in his \nCRP analysis (which – "}

Mr Kaczmarek demonstrated time and again that he was not an \nindependent expert seeking to assist the Court but a ‘hired gun’ seeking to defend \nabsurdly high valuations. Examples of this stance arose: ( i) in relation to two sets of \nPetrol Station fuel volume data from 2016 (which Mr Kaczmarek was eventually \nforced to concede were “ flatly inconsistent ” with each other {Day21/96:3}), ( ii) in his \nCRP analysis (which – notwithstanding the Court’s intervention – he said included \npolitical and other risks when it plainly did not) {Day22/36:25} - {Day22/38:12}, ( iii) \nin his highly misleading presentation of petrol station comparables, ( iv) in relation to \nthe operational status of the OSFs (eventually acknowledging that there were “ doubts ” \nas to operationality {Day21/48:15}), and ( v) in his OSF cross checks (where, e.g., he \nconcealed that the tribunal in the Stabil arbitration had reduced his valuation by 25%). \nIn relation to five items of real estate, Mr Kaczmarek simply adopted the value \n“verified ” by the NBU, despite ( i) having no information about the process undertaken \n(if any), ( ii) acknowledging that the NBU’s “ verified ” values were subject to criticism in \nthe EY Report, and ( iii) finding that the valuation underlying NBU’s “ verified ” value of \nHotel Zirka contained “ clear errors ”. This illogical stance – which led to a silly valuation \nof a stadium which cannot sell its seats or host international matches – was taken \nbecause Mr Kaczmarek fundamentally misunderstood his role.  \n(5) Philip Seymour. Mr Seymour gave evidence politely and answered the questions that \nwere put to him concisely. But his answers also served to demonstrate that the Court \ncannot safely rely on his evidence – he admitted making a string of basic errors in his \ninitial report, and has provided no datapoints which can be used to assess his \nvaluations.  \nAA2/15/424\n418 N3 PETROL STATIONS  \nAsset Credit Value  Restated \n2016 Value  Bezant \nvaluation Kaczmarek \nvaluation Difference \n(Bank / D1 \nvaluations) \n246 Petrol \nStations UAH 6,341m  UAH \n1,852m UAH 1,869m  UAH 8,444m UAH 6,575m \nUSD equiv.645 USD 254m  USD 74m  USD 75m  USD 311m  USD 264m  \n(1) Introduction \n842 Mr Bezant assesses the value of the Petrol Stations at UAH 1,869m using a DCF valuation, \nwhile Mr Kaczmarek values them at UAH 8,444m using a 50:50 weighting of a DCF \nvaluation and a market comparables approach. \n843 There are three main reasons why their DCF valuations differ so substantially: \n(1) Volume of fuel sales. The volume of fuel sold at a petrol station is plainly the most \nsignificant input into its value.646 Mr Kaczmarek uses the same volume data that two \nvaluers, UCE and Veritas, used for reports they produced for the Bank in 2016 while \nMr Bezant uses data from a report produced in March 2019 by Volyn (which, while \nnot perfect, was consistent with the figures from Ukrstat (the national statistics \nagency) and Naftogaz). The volume data used by Mr Kaczmarek was artificially \ninflated by the Petrol Station owners (D1-2’s companies) and/or BOK employees \n(including Plyska and Chernyshov) when the Bank was under D1-2’s control.  \n(2) RONIC. Mr Bezant includes an adjustment in his DCF valuation to limit the return \non new invested capital ( “RONIC” ). Its purpose is to reflect the fact that, as the \nexperts agree, firms generally do not make returns in excess of the cost of capital in \nthe long run. Mr Kaczmarek, however, asserts that the Petrol Stations can make \nsupernormal profits in perpetuity by virtue of their location and a ‘first mover’ \nadvantage which he says would preclude competition.  \n(3) Country risk premium. The discount rate used by the valuers is expressed as a \npercentage which aggregates a number of matters, one of which is the ‘country risk \npremium’ ( “CRP” ): the riskier the country, the higher the CRP, the higher the cost of \nequity, and the larger th"}

This contradicted what he had said in his reports {D27/1/33} (¶101)).  \n{AA2/15/422}\nAA2/15/425\n419 when calculating its present value. Mr Bezant applies a CRP of 7.6%; Mr Kaczmarek \none of 3%.  \n844 D1’s written Valuation Submissions placed significant emphasis on Mr Kaczmarek’s “ robust ” \nmarket comparables approach as an alternative if the Court considers that the uncertainty \nabout fuel volumes is too great to adopt either expert’s DCF valuation {AA3/2/7}, 14 \n(¶¶25-26, 40). But, as became clear during Mr Kaczmarek’s evidence, his comparables were \nnot comparable at all; and his presentation of them was seriously misleading.  \n845 Other valuation issues include ( i) the appropriate valuation currency and, if valuation in USD \nis appropriate, the date of valuation and conversion to UAH; and ( ii) whether it is \nappropriate to use data produced after the valuation date, or Mr Kaczmarek’s prior \nvaluations of petrol stations in Crimea, to inform the process. \n(2) Fuel volume data \n(a) Data provided to valuers in 2015 and 2016 was unreliable \n(i) Introduction \n846 In the Bank’s Valuation Submissions {AA2/5}, we explained – by reference to the “Topchy \nSpreadsheet”  and the “August 2016 Spreadsheet”  – that there was clear evidence of \nmanipulation of fuel volumes within the Bank. In particular: \n(1) The Topchy Spreadsheet {K2-C/248P} (spreadsheet) {K2-C/248M} (metadata)  \n(created on 19.3.15) contains two different sets of data, under ‘TOPCHII’ and \n‘Valuation’ headings, for the same 994 petrol stations (including 243 of the 246 Petrol \nStations) and for the same period January 2014 – February 2015. The ‘Valuation’ data \nwas inflated by an average of 241% from the ‘Topchy’ data so as to generate artificially \nhigh valuations. \n(2) The (later) August 2016 Spreadsheet {K2-C/249P} (spreadsheet) {K2-C/249M}  \n(metadata) (last modified on 2.8.16) contains the monthly fuel volume data for petrol \nstations for January 2015 to June 2016. The fuel volumes for 2015 in the August 2016 \nSpreadsheet match the fuel volume data provided to UCE and Veritas. Critically, that \ndata was also inflated – the Bank can point to over 1,000 examples of the data \nAA2/15/426\n420 contained in the ‘Topchy’ column of the Topchy Spreadsheet being inflated by \nprecisely 300%.647 \n(ii) The Topchy Spreadsheet \n847 The significance of the Topchy Spreadsheet is summarised above. See also ¶¶14-21 of, and \nat Schedules 1-2 to, the Bank’s Valuation Submissions {AA2/5/8-11} {AA2/6} {AA2/7}. \n848 D1’s Valuation Submissions suggested that the provenance of the data in the Topchy \nSpreadsheet is “ entirely unknown ” and that D1 has not had “ any opportunity to adduce any evidence ” \nas to the same: {AA3/2/16-17} (¶50(1)-(2)). These are thoroughly bad points: \n(1) Oil Ukraine was a company which managed D1-2’s petroleum businesses, as is most \nobviously shown by D1 approving the making of a UAH 658,000 payment to \n“OilUkr ” in October 2015 {K5-A1/30}.648 \n(2) Yuriy Topchy (topchy@oilukraine.com) was a senior employee of Oil Ukraine, had \nan extension on the ‘Black’ {K5-E"}

Topchiy, the chain of petrol stations on http://avias.com.ua/ amounts to 1,625 \nunits, of which 1,218 petrol stations are pledged to the bank (221 petrol stations of which are \nnot operational, closed or have been dismantled) ” {E7/12.1} {E7/12.1M}; and \n(c) On 5.12.15, Plyska (BOK) said in a Skype exchange: “ According to Topchiy’s data \n… Zaporozhnefteproduct – 57 petrol stations ” {K6/53.6.2/2}, \n(3) Mr Kaczmarek has prayed in aid his work as D1’s expert in two ICSID arbitrations \ninvolving the expropriation of D1-2’s Stabil and Ukrnafta petrol stations in Crimea \n(the “Crimean Arbitrations” ). The Stabil award records that Topchy was an “ executive \nmanager ” for the claimants (viz. D1 and D2) {D26/22/30} (¶114) and {D26/22/25} \n(fn. 15) . \n \n647  Of the 243 Petrol Stations contained in the Topchy Spreadsheet: ( i) 207 contain a uniform 300% increase; \n(ii) four contain an increase of between 333% and 1604% (FTI numbers 111, 160, 176 and 290); and ( iii) 32 \nare identified but no fuel volume is ascribed to them. \n648  Further examples are set out at fn329 to the Bank’s Valuation Submissions: {AA2/1/162}.  \nAA2/15/427\n421 (4) The Bank has alleged since late 2021 that D1-2 provided false and/or incomplete \ninformation to valuers for the purpose of supporting inflated Credit Values \n(Reply/¶28F {A1/25/52}; Bank RRFI 4.2.22 {A2/20/3-5} (¶2(c)(ii), App. 1)). While \nD1’s abandoned trial evidence made brief reference to petrol stations and fuel volumes \nprovided to the NBU {B2/1/14} (¶77), {E18/194}, no evidence was volunteered as \nto the management of the former or the production of the latter. \n849 In light of the above, the Court is invited to conclude that the fuel volume data under the \nheading ‘TOPCHII’ was supplied to the Bank by Mr Topchy. Mr Kaczmarek agreed that \nthis would be a “ fair assumption ” {Day21/104:10-15}. Indeed: \n(1) Mr Kaczmarek agreed that there were “ uniform ” increases from the ‘Topchy’ data to \nthe ‘Valuation’ data {Day21/105:13-20}. Implausibly, he suggested that the reason for \nthe (fixed) inflation was that the ‘Topchy’ data “ didn’t capture everything ” {Day21/105:1} \nand, head planted firmly in the sand, he also suggested that it was “ very difficult…to draw \nany kind of conclusion ” from the Topchy Spreadsheet {Day21/101:25} - \n{Day21/102:8}.649 \n(2) Mr Kaczmarek was inclined to accept, albeit in principle and without having done the \nanalysis himself, what the Bank seeks to show with the graph in Schedule 2 to its \nValuation Submissions {AA2/7}650, namely that the Petrol Stations transferred to the \nBank (represented by red lines on the right-hand side of the chart) had fuel volumes \nwhich were “ many orders of magnitude ” lower than the highest volume petrol station \nlocated in Kyiv (which was not transferred): see {Day21/118:5} - {Day21/123:5}.  \n(iii) The BT, UCE and Veritas Reports in 2015 and 2016 \n850 At ¶¶22-28 of the Bank’s Valuation Submissions, we explained that: \n(1) The Topchy Spreadsheet was produced the day after Baker Tilly was instructed to \nvalue a number of Petrol Stations on 18.3.15 ("}

Cp. Schedule 1  to the Bank’s Valuation \nSubmissions{AA2/6}, demonstrating the inflation of the ‘Topchy’ data for 243 Petrol Stations. \n650  This schedule ranks all 994 petrol stations by their total fuel volume sales (excluding gas) in 2014, using the \n‘Topchy’ data. The bars coloured red represent petrol stations that are Transferred Assets; the bars coloured \nblue represent petrol stations that are not.  \nAA2/15/428\n422 (2) This instruction led to the “BT 2015 PS Reports” dated 22.4.15. Schedule 3 to the \nBank’s Valuation Submissions {AA2/8} explained that those reports made clear that \nBaker Tilly had been provided with the ‘Valuation’ data from the Topchy \nSpreadsheet651 (as Mr Kaczmarek accepted {Day21/106:17-25} - {Day21/107:1-10}; \n{Day21/109:18-21}). \n(3) On 21.12.15, Baker Tilly was instructed to produce a further report valuing 994 petrol \nstations as at 31.12.15. The report was produced on 12.5.16 (the “BT 2016 PS \nReport” ), and also contained inflated figures, showing significantly more diesel sales \nthan petrol. This was consistent with the data previously provided to Baker Tilly (as \nMr Kaczmarek appears to have accepted in XX: {Day21/109:10-17}; \n{Day21/109:25} - {Day21/110:1}), but inconsistent with the data provided to UCE \nand Veritas for reports commissioned on 25.4.16 and 25.7.16. \n(4) UCE and Veritas produced the “UCE 2016 PS DCF Report”  (250 petrol stations, \nincluding 245 of the 246 Petrol Stations) and “Veritas 2016 PS Report”  (216 petrol \nstations, including 211 Petrol Stations). As Mr Kaczmarek accepted {Day21/111:16} \n- {Day21/113:7}, {Day21/115:12-16}, UCE and Veritas were provided with the data \nin the August 2016 Spreadsheet, containing monthly fuel volumes for Jan 15 – Jun 16. \n(5) Schedule 4 {AA2/9} to the Bank’s Valuation Submissions demonstrates how that \ndata was inflated. In XX, Mr Kaczmarek accepted that the figures in the August 2016 \nSpreadsheet for January and February 2015 were four times those in the Topchy \nSpreadsheet for the same months ( i.e. they had been inflated by 300%) \n{Day21/114:12-16}, {Day21/115:6-11}, yet refused to accept that “ someone has taken \nthe Topchii data, inflated it 300% and then given that inflated data to UCE and Veritas ” \n{Day21/114:17-20}. The Court is invited to infer that all of the data in the August \n2016 Spreadsheet, including for months after February 2015, was similarly inflated. \n(iv) The IK Volume Spreadsheets \n851 At ¶¶29-30 of the Bank’s Valuation Submissions, we referred to the “IK Volume \nSpreadsheets”  disclosed by D1 at the same time as Mr Kaczmarek’s report and after Mr \nBezant had submitted his.

The custodians of the IK Volume Spreadsheets were the owners \nof the Petrol Stations (the majority of whom have given no other disclosure, from which an \nadverse inference should be drawn) and we explained that the IK Volume Spreadsheets \n \n651  The Baker Tilly reports set out the average daily fuel volume sales for each type of fuel which match the \nmonthly figures in the Topchy Spreadsheet. \nAA2/15/429\n423 simply reproduce the data in the August 2016 Spreadsheet on a company-by-company basis. \nIndeed, beyond the title and data being identical, Mr Kaczmarek agreed in XX \n{Day21/117:25} ff that the scheme used to number the Petrol Stations in the August 2016 \nSpreadsheet is also found in the IK Volume Spreadsheets \n852 However, even after reading the Bank’s Valuation Submissions, D1 implausibly maintained \nthat the IK Volume Spreadsheets constitute independent corroborative evidence of the \nPetrol Station volumes and claimed that they “ contain the contemporaneous throughput data ” and \n“are therefore the most reliable data available ”;652 more remarkably still Mr Kaczmarek stood by \nhis view that he had no reason to believe they were inauthentic or unreliable {Day21/99:2-\n23} and said that he was “ very confident, in fact ” about relying on them {Day21/141:9-19}. \n853 But that obstinate position is undermined by the rest of Mr Kaczmarek’s evidence: \n(1) Mr Kaczmarek agreed that the data in the IK Volume Spreadsheets was “ the same ” as \nthe August 2016 Spreadsheet, but said that he did not know “ which preceded which ” \n{Day21/117:6-12}. The metadata recently provided by D1 makes that clear: the IK \nVolume Spreadsheets were created on 3.8.16 and 4.8.16 ( e.g. {K2-C/1M}), one or two \ndays after the August 2016 Spreadsheet was produced {K2-C/249M}. \n(2) Having accepted that the August 2016 Spreadsheet contained inflated figures from the \nTopchy Spreadsheet, and that the IK Volume Spreadsheets contain the same data as \nthe August 2016 Spreadsheet, Mr Kaczmarek’s suggestion that there is no reason to \nbelieve that the IK Volume Spreadsheets are “ inauthentic or unreliable ” is wholly illogical \n{Day21/99:14-18}. \n(3) So too is D1’s submission that: “ the purported Topchy data of unknown provenance cannot be \naccurate as [it is] contradicted by the contemporaneous documents from the enterprise owners [sc. the \nIK Volume Spreadsheets ], those who actually owned or controlled the Petrol Stations ”.653 Even if \nstamped by the “ enterprise owners ”, the IK Volume Spreadsheets simply reproduce \ninflated data from the August 2016 Spreadsheet (itself produced within the Bank). \n(v) The experts’ agreement that fuel volume data is inconsistent \n854 At ¶31 of the Bank’s Valuation Submissions, we explained how Mr Kaczmarek had \nattempted to minimise the inconsistencies in the data provided to Baker Tilly, on the one \n \n652  D1’s Valuation Submissions/¶49 {AA3/2/16}. \n653  D1’s Valuation Submissions/¶50(4) {AA3/2/17}. \nAA2/15/430\n424 hand, and UCE and Veritas, on the other, by suggesting that, in aggregate ( i.e. across all fuel \ntypes), the numbers were almost identical. \n855 In XX, Mr Kaczmarek acknowledged that it was “ clearly not satisfactory that they’re different data \nsets” {Day21/108:20-21} and that, other than parroting D1’s belatedly introduced argument \nabout coupon and prepayment card sales discussed below, he “ can’t resolve any of these differences \nor explain why the differences have occurred ” {Day21/108:24} - {Day21/109:2}. He was unable to \nventure any innocent explanation as to how the two very different data sets were produced \n{Day21/96:4-17}.

Now that a comparison can be made for 243 Petrol \nStations, Mr Kaczmarek agrees that “[ t]here are, by product, very different -- very substantial \ndifferences, yes ” {Day21/94:8-9}, that the volumes are “ fundamentally inconsistent ” \n{Day21/95:14-15}, and that, by product, the data sets are “ flatly inconsistent ” {Day21/96:3}.  \n856 Mr Kaczmarek also accepts the substantial discrepancies in the volume data for individual \npetrol stations; and while his report stated that “ these differences offset almost exactly ”, he accepted \nin XX that he “[ didn’t ] know” whether one type of fuel could be offset against another \n{Day21/97:6} (they may, for example, have different mark-ups {K2-B/4/57}).654 But more \nimportantly, and as we have set out above, it is simply not the case (as Mr Kaczmarek asserts) \nthat the “ detailed sales volume data provided to Baker Tilly indicates that the average fuel sales volume per \nstation are effectively identical to those provided to UCE and Veritas ”.655 The data was all grossly \ninflated, but in different ways, and Mr Kaczmarek’s suggestion that this was due to “ an error \non the part of the enterprise owners, the Bank, or Baker Tilly ”656 is fanciful. \n(b) Mr Bezant’s DCF valuation \n857 In light of the clearly manipulated and inconsistent data provided to the valuers who \nauthored the 2016 Valuation Reports, Mr Bezant uses the volume data in the valuation \nreport produced by Volyn in March 2019, which valued 199 Petrol Stations as at 31.12.16 \n(the “Volyn Restated PS Report” ).657 That report was commissioned by the Bank for the \npurpose of restating the Bank’s financial statements as at 31.12.16 in 2018. The volume data \nused by Volyn in this report is lower than that used in the 2016 Valuation Reports. \n \n654  See also Kaczmarek4/¶¶92-93, 96 {D27/1/30}. \n655  Kaczmarek4/¶96 {D27/1/31}. \n656  Bezant-KaczmarekJR/¶7.17 {D25/1/41}. \n657  This report is found in tabs {K2-B/29} (pp. 1-201), {K2-B/30} (pp. 202-401), and {K2-B/31} (pp. 402-559). \nAA2/15/431\n425 858 Volyn did not use historical fuel volume data from 2015-16. Instead, it performed field \nstudies of comparable petrol stations and rolled the data back to 2016 based on changes to \noverall regional fuel volume data for the Petrol Stations.658 While Volyn did not describe the \ndetail of its field studies, its report set out (across 327 pages) descriptions of each of the 199 \nPetrol Stations, on a region by region basis, taking into account: the population of the district \nin which the Petrol Station is located, the number of petrol stations in that region, the flow-\nthroughs of traffic and proximity to main highways, the total area of the Petrol Station, its \nconstituent parts ( e.g. “operator room ”, “gas module ”), the different types ( e.g. A92, A95) and \nbrands of fuel it sells, and the number of tanks on the site (see e.g. {K2-B/29/61}, {K2-\nB/29/63}, {K2-B/29/64}, {K2-B/29/67}. Whilst Mr Howard KC dismissed this as “ mind-\nnumbing detail ” {Day19/21:18} - {Day19/22:10}, it is this detail that enabled Volyn to apply \nthe results of their field studies to the particular characteristics of each Petrol Station.  \n859 Mr Kaczmarek contends that Volyn’s volume data is unreliable, as it is based on notional \n(rather than actual) figures, and criticises Mr Bezant’s reliance on it.659 Those criticisms are \nmisplaced. Mr Bezant recognises that the volume data in the Volyn Restated PS Report is a \nproxy for actual performance figures.660 But the purported volume data provided to the 2016 \nvaluers is so clearly manipulated that Mr Bezant could not rely on it.661 \n860 In all the circumstances, the volume figures in the Voly"}

Bezant-Assets1/¶4.28{D19/1/53}. \n661  In this regard, we note that all the valuers who valued the Petrol Stations in 2017 and 2018 were provided with \nthe historical data used in the 2016 Valuation Reports, but disregarded or refused to use it: Bezant-\nAssets1/¶¶4.34, 4.37, 4.38, 4.59 {D19/1/54}. \n662  Bezant-Assets1/¶¶4.60-4.62 {D19/1/61}. \nAA2/15/432\n426 “wholesale ” rather than “ retail” sales {AA3/2/18}.663 This belated addition to his case is \nwithout merit.  \n862 We set out below ( i) the relevant Ukrainian legal framework distinguishing between ‘retail’ \nand ‘wholesale’ sales by petrol stations, ( ii) the reliability of the Ukrstat cross-check, and ( iii) \nthe reliability of the Naftogaz cross-check. \n(i) ‘Retail’ / ‘wholesale’ distinction \n863 There is clearly a practice in Ukraine of using prepayment cards to pay for fuel.664 In 2016, \nas a matter of Ukrainian law, any sale of fuel by a petrol station should have been treated as \na ‘retail’ sale subject to excise tax, and that is the case irrespective of whether the fuel is paid \nfor in cash, prepayment card or coupon: see letters from the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine \ndated 18.3.15 {E8/106.1} and 13.10.15 {E11/278.1} and amendments to Article 14.1.212 \nof the Ukrainian Tax Code which took effect in January 2016 {E12/170.1}.665 It is \nimprobable to suppose that sales by prepayment card to consumers were treated as ‘retail’ \nsales for tax purposes in Ukraine in 2016 but otherwise included in ‘wholesale’ industry \nfigures. \n(ii) Ukrstat cross-check \n864 Ukrstat is the State Statistics Service of Ukraine: \n(1) Ukrstat defines retail sales as “ sales in real terms (for cash, bank payment cards, coupons, smart \ncards etc.) directly to the population  via petrol stations for personal (not-for-profit) consumption ” and \nwholesale sales as “ sales… to business entities  via petrol stations for cashless payments (under \nagreements) for their business activities ” {E18/8.01/2}. Consistently with the tax treatment \nof such sales, Ukrstat’s retail sales clearly include sales paid for by “ coupons, smart cards ”, \nwhile wholesales will include sales to corporate entities, pursuant to contracts for sale, \nfor use in their “ business activities ”.  \n(2) Ukrstat publishes data on its website under two headings: “ volume wholesale and retail \ntrade of light petroleum oil and gas from the petrol stations ” and “ volume retail trade light petroleum \n \n663  The point was rather undermined by Mr Kaczmarek explaining in evidence that “ I’m aware that defendant 1 has \nindicated that many of these volumes were sold on coupons or cards that aren’t necessarily captured.

The position was later confirmed in Supreme Court rulings in 2019: see \n{E17/265.4.001} and {E17/338.1}. In the latter judgment, the Supreme Court held that a sale of petrol from \none petrol station company to another was a ‘retail’ sale (despite it being a business-to-business transaction) \nbecause the sale was effected through a petrol station. \nAA2/15/433\n427 oil and gas from the petrol stations ” {E18/25.01}. The ‘retail only’ data shows a total of \n2.8m tonnes sold by Ukrainian petrol stations in 2016 (petrol: 1,624,697 tonnes; diesel: \n1,182,911 tonnes) {E18/25.04/2}; the ‘retail and wholesale’ data shows 3.564m \ntonnes sold by Ukrainian petrol stations in the same period (petrol: 1,839,951 tonnes; \ndiesel: 1,724,193 tonnes) {E18/25.03/2}. It follows that the total wholesale figure for \npetrol and diesel sold through Ukrainian petrol stations in 2016 was 0.75m tonnes \n(3.564 – 2.8 = 0.75). \n865 Ukrstat also reports on the total number of petrol stations in Ukraine ({D19/12P.1}). This \nenables a calculation of the average volume per petrol station, both including and excluding \nthe wholesale sales (described above), which strongly supports the reasonableness of the \nVolyn volumes:  \n \n866 In XX, Mr Kaczmarek acknowledged that he had no reason to question the accuracy of the \nUkrstat figures, but then proceeded to assert that Ukrstat was reliant on “ the willingness of \npeople to report the information ” and the data might be a case of “ garbage in, garbage out ”.666 He \ndoes not appear to have investigated how Ukrstat gather the data they report before querying \nits reliability {Day21/129:15-20}. In fact, in 2015-16, all petrol stations were required by law \nto report their retail and wholesale sales to Ukrstat on a monthly basis and failure to do so \ncould constitute an administrative offence, so he was plainly wrong to suggest it was depend \n \n666  {Day21/126:11-12}; {Day21/127:8-14}; {Day21/129:7-10}. \nAA2/15/434\n428 on people’s “ willingness to report the information ”.667 The Ukrstat data is the product of a \ncontinual nationwide reporting obligation on petrol stations: there is no basis to question its \nreliability. \n(iii) The Naftogaz cross-check \n867 Naftogaz’s 2016 report includes the following diagram {D19/96/43}: \n \n868 The diagram shows Ukraine imported 6.6m tonnes of diesel and gasoline and refined 1.5m \ntonnes (total: 8.1m tonnes), of which 2.8m tonnes was sold as ‘retail’ and 5.3m tonnes sold \nas ‘wholesales’. Mr Bezant rightly pointed out that the Privat network of 1,021 petrol stations \nis said to be responsible for 14% of retail sales totalling 0.4m tonnes, which implies an annual \naverage throughput per petrol station of 384 tonnes. That is more consistent with the Volyn \ndata (average per petrol station: 548 tonnes p.a.) than the UCE/Veritas data (average per \npetrol station: 1,333 tonnes p.a.).668 Furthermore, the total throughput of the 246 Petrol \nStations implied by the UCE/Veritas data is c. 400,000 tonnes: in other words, the \nUCE/Veritas data implies that all of the Privat network’s sales reported by Naftogaz were \nmade by just 24% of the 1,021 Privat petrol stations while the other 778 petrol stations sold \n \n667  See ( i) Article 9 of the State Statistics Law, which p"}

But in any event: \n(1) The vast majority of the 5.3m tonnes of wholesale sales will have nothing to do with \npetrol stations ( e.g. they will be sales via fuel tankers or fuel lines to the army, police, \nfire brigade, ambulance service, bus companies, heavy industry etc.).671  \n(2) If one assumes that 15% of the wholesale figure might be attributable to wholesale \nsales at petrol stations, this gives a figure of 0.795m tonnes. That is consistent with \nthe difference between Ukrstat’s ‘retail’ and ‘wholesale and retail’ figures (0.75m \ntonnes).  \n(3) Naftogaz reports that the Privat network had a 14% share of the ‘retail’ sales totalling \n0.4m tonnes. Assuming the Privat network’s share of the wholesale market is the same \nas its share of retail sales, that would imply the 1,021 Privat stations sold 14% of the \n0.75m tonnes of ‘wholesale’ petrol and diesel, i.e. 0.1m tonnes. The total retail and \nwholesale sales would therefore total 0.5m tonnes, or an average of 489 tonnes per \nPrivat petrol station. That remains consistent with the Volyn data (548 tonnes p.a.), \nbut is still nowhere near the volumes implied by the UCE/Veritas data (1,333 tonnes \np.a.). \n870 Finally, the volume figures for the 994 Privat petrol stations given to Baker Tilly in 2015 (the \n‘Valuation’ data in the Topchy Spreadsheet) showed total volume sales for January 2014 to \nFebruary 2015, excluding gas, of 2.6m tonnes {K2-C/248P/194}. The valuation data given \nto Baker Tilly in 2016 to value the same 994 Privat petrol stations showed total volume sales \nfor 2015, excluding gas, of 2.2m tonnes {K2-C/247}, {D26/1/77} (Table 6-2). On any \nview, it is unrealistic to suppose that the 994 petrol stations in the Privat network sold a \nvolume of fuel in 2014 and 2015 which constituted between 78-92%672 of the entire annual \n \n669  Bezant-Assets2/¶¶6.18-6.19 {D26/1/76}. \n670  D1’s Valuation Submissions/¶55 {AA3/2/17}.

It is quite clear \nthat the volume data provided to the contemporaneous valuers was artificially inflated. \n(iv) Lack of evidence of large wholesale volumes \n871 D1’s case that the Petrol Stations engaged in large-scale sales via prepayment cards which \nwere reported as ‘wholesale’ rather than ‘retail’ sales is not supported by the evidence. None \nof the IK Volume Spreadsheets or contemporaneous valuation reports separately report \n‘retail’ and ‘wholesale’ volumes. Nor has any documentation been disclosed by D1-2 to \nsuggest that was the case.673 Nor has D1 called Topchy, or indeed anyone else in D1-2’s \npetroleum business, to explain the situation.  \n(d) Mr Kaczmarek’s cross-check \n872 Mr Kaczmarek purports to perform his own “ cross-check ”, which he stated in XX was solely \nto determine if his valuation was “ wholly unrealistic ”.674 He calculates the average number of \nvehicles per day which would visit each station based on the different fuel volumes.675 He \nsays the data in the 2016 Valuation Reports suggests the Petrol Stations were “ high performing ” \n(69 vehicles per day) whereas the Volyn Restated PS Report data suggests they were \n“significantly underperforming ” (29 vehicles per day). That is an extraordinary piece of work. As \nMr Kaczmarek accepted, it is based on multiple unevidenced assumptions: ( i) that the \naverage Ukrainian car has a 20-gallon (76-litre) tank (in fact, an average European car has a \nfar smaller fuel tank capacity); ( ii) that every car adds 16 gallons on each visit to the petrol \nstation; and ( iii) that the petrol stations are open 365 days per year for 16 hours a day.676 It \nis also based on Mr Kaczmarek’s own assumptions as to how many vehicles per day would \nconstitute ‘good’ or ‘bad’ performance.677 \n(3) RONIC \n873 The RONIC (‘return on new invested capital’) adjustment included in Mr Bezant’s DCF \nmodel has a c. UAH 0.5 bn (US$20m) impact on his valuation of the Petrol Stations.678 It is \nimportant to note that the issue is not about the Petrol Stations’ net margin on sales – which \nthe experts have both assumed to be 10% throughout their respective DCF valuations, \n \n673  Despite Mr Kaczmarek requesting such documents from D1: {Day21/135:22} - {Day21/136:18}. \n674  {Day21/144:17-18}. \n675  Kaczmarek2/¶¶60-61 {D21/1/24-25}. \n676  Kaczmarek XX {Day21/142:17} - {Day21/144:22}; {Day22/1:5} - {Day22/2:16}. \n677  Cf.

That is \na fundamental misunderstanding of a market economy {Day22/9:17-18}. \n(3) More realistically, Mr Bezant does not consider that the Petrol Stations can maintain \nreturns in excess of the cost of capital in the long run as they do not possess a \ncompetitive advantage. This is because ( i) they supply homogenous goods (as Mr \nKaczmarek agrees);686 (ii) there were multiple competitors in the market or able to \nenter it at the date of valuation;687 and ( iii) there are no significant barriers to entry.688  \n(4) D1’s criticism689 that Mr Bezant “ ignored ” a graph {K2-B/15/88} demonstrating a \ndecrease in the number of petrol stations in Ukraine in 2014 - 2015 is misplaced: ( i) \nwhile the graph shows a decrease in 2014 - H1 2015, the trend in 2016 is clearly \nupwards; and ( ii) as Mr Bezant pointed"}

Equally misplaced was D1’s criticism that Mr Bezant is not \nan expert in the “ competitive environment of retail petroleum stations in Ukraine ” \n{Day19/74:1-4}: nor is Mr Kaczmarek and this observation fails to recognise that \ncompetition is an inherent feature of all businesses, which Mr Bezant is undoubtedly \nqualified to address. \n874 Mr Bezant’s DCF calculation incorporates this competitive pressure by assuming that \ninvestment in the form of capital expenditure will be required to maintain profits over \ntime.690  \n \n686  {Day22/11:25} - {Day22/12:2}. \n687  Bezant-Assets2/¶¶6.38 - 6.75 {D26/1/81}. \n688  Bezant-KaczmarekJS/¶¶7.22-7.23 {D25/1/45}; Bezant-Assets2/¶6.35 {D26/1/80}. \n689  {Day19/84:17} ff. \n690  Although this is for ease of presentation / computational convenience; as explained below, he could equally \nhave assumed that e.g. profit margins would be reduced because competition would prevent increases in price \nor would cause suppliers and staff to demand to be paid more: see Bezant-Assets1/¶4.73 {D19/1/65} and \n{Day19/70:2-9}, {Day19/71:1-10}. \nAA2/15/439\n433 875 Despite agreeing that the market is “ mature and competitive ” {Day22/5:14-15},  Mr Kaczmarek \nconsiders it “ illogical ” that the Petrol Stations would have to make investments which did not \nresult in direct economic returns but sought to stave off competition; he considered that the \nonly required investment would be for maintenance.691 However, despite Mr Kaczmarek’s \nunwillingness to accept the point in XX, his assertion stands in stark contrast to the evidence \nof his own clients – companies owned by D1-2 – in relation to the renovation of the petrol \nstations valued in the Crimean Arbitrations: see {D26/22/109} and {Day22/15:13} - \n{Day22/17:19}).  \n876 Mr Bezant also points out that widely cited works on valuation require RONIC to be taken \ninto account when calculating terminal values or discount rates in a DCF calculation.692 \nIndeed, Mr Kaczmarek appears to have accepted that McKinsey’s “ recommended formula for \nDCF valuation ” {D26/21/2} includes RONIC as an input, but argued that this applies only \n“if there’s new investment that’s going to be made ” ({Day22/18:16} - {Day22/19:2}).  \n877 Mr Kaczmarek’s gripe seems to be that Mr Bezant did not assume that any actual investment \nwould be made ( e.g. for renovations) and that Mr Bezant’s growth in profits is based on \nGDP forecasts and crude oil prices which do not require any further investment \n{Day22/18:4-8}; {Day22/19:13-15}.

The default is to set it equal to the cost of capital [sc. the WACC ]. For 1 in 5 companies where I think that the \ncompetitive advantages are large and significant, I will leave the return on capital above the cost of capital by maybe 2% or 3% ”; \n“economic theory suggests that competition will eventually eliminate abnormal returns, so for many companies, set ROIC [sc. return \non invested capital ] equal to WACC ”. {D26/1/84}. \n693  For example, Mr Bezant could equally have assumed that, if the Petrol Stations did not respond to potential \ncompetition by investing in their business, competitors would have entered the market thereby reducing profit \nmargins achievable (either through decreased prices or increased operating costs). Indeed, rather than Mr \nBezant’s and Mr Kaczmarek’s assumed margin of 10%, all of the contemporaneous petrol station valuations \nin 2017 and 2018 assumed margins of 7% (see Bezant-Assets1/Table A7-6 and Table A7-8 {D19/8/16}; \n{D19/8/23}). Broadly, the effect of a 7% margin compared to a 10% margin is a reduction in value of 30%, \nwhich is larger than the effect of Mr Bezant’s RONIC adjustment. \nAA2/15/440\n434 in profit, since it is not necessarily the case that all of the increase in cost is passed on \nto consumers (indeed, Mr Kaczmarek himself – like Mr Bezant – assumes that only \n50% of the cost will be passed on: {D21/3P/3} (row 43)), such that costs will increase \nor demand will be depressed and further investment may be required to sustain profits.  \n878 Based on his assessment of the cost of capital (17.5%) and a premium of 1%694, Mr Bezant \nassumes that RONIC will decrease progressively to reach 18.5% by the terminal period \n(which he assumes will be reached after c. five years, in 2020).695 As explained above, he \nimplements it by assuming that capital expenditure will increase annually until the RONIC \nhas reached 18.5% (and provided an explanation of the mechanics of his approach on \n{Day20/29:10} - {Day20/31:11}).696  \n(4) Country risk premium (CRP) \n879 The experts agree that the cost of equity calculation in their discount rate methodologies \nrequires an adjustment to account for the incremental risk of the Petrol Stations being \nlocated in Ukraine - the ‘country risk premium’ (the “CRP” ).

And it is telling Mr Kaczmarek did not think to mention that, in the \nCrimean Arbitrations, the tribunal-appointed expert put forward a CRP of 8% or 8.8% for \nUkraine ( i.e. higher than Mr Bezant’s CRP of 7.6%) {D26/22/89}. \n882 Mr Kaczmarek disagrees with the “ blanket application ” of sovereign bond spread to every \nbusiness as a proxy for country risk because “ not all companies will have the same exposure ”,700 \nalthough he acknowledged in XX that the Petrol Stations’ customers, staff and assets are \nlocated in Ukraine and its taxes are paid in Ukraine {Day22/38:13} - {Day22/40:6} ( cf. an \nexport business or one which provides services to international customers).  \n883 Mr Kaczmarek criticises, in particular, Mr Bezant’s application of a ‘lambda’ of 1 – meaning \nthat he considers the Petrol Stations to be no more or less exposed to country risk than the \naverage Ukrainian business – because the application of any ‘lambda’ at all (as suggested by \nProfessor Damodaran, whose work Mr Kaczmarek otherwise relies on) suffers from the \ndefect that “[ t]here’s no scientific way of measuring it ” {Day22/40:11-16}.

It is clear that his analysis ignores any consideration of political, legal or regulatory \nrisk, despite leading valuation practitioners recognising such risks and Mr Kaczmarek \nreferring to them in his expert reports in other proceedings.703 These risks include e.g. the \nrisk of expropriation and the effects of internal or external conflict (tensions between Russia \nand Ukraine were high in 2016), trust in the Ukrainian judiciary and its willingness to address \ncorruption, and Ukraine’s regulatory framework in corporate matters.704  \n887 Indeed, much of Mr Kaczmarek’s evidence on this topic was equally unconvincing. See, e.g.: \n(1) That “ the risk of an outright war between Russia and Ukraine was very remote in most anyone’s \nestimation ” {Day22/26:2-3}, despite media reports to the contrary.705  \n(2) That the risk of a conflict between Russia and Ukraine was not a “ political risk ” but an \n(unexpressed) economic risk {Day22/29:17-24}. \n \n703  Bezant-KaczmarekJS/¶6.9{D25/1/26}; Bezant-Assets2/¶¶6.62-6.68 {D26/1/86-87}. While Mr Bezant \nnotes at Bezant-Assets2/¶6.68 {D26/1/87} that the exclusion of these risks is consistent with the approach \nadopted by Mr Kaczmarek in the Crimean Arbitrations, those proceedings related to expropriation by a state \nand the same considerations would not apply. \n704  Bezant-Assets2/¶¶6.64 - 6.66 {D26/1/87}. \n705  On 17.8.16, the Financial Times reported that the Institute for the Study of War had stated that “[ p]reparations \nfor conventional conflict between Russia and Ukraine are accelerating, and the likelihood of open war is increasing rapidly ”: \n{D26/29}. \nAA2/15/443\n437 (3) That, while having not “ specifically investigated ” widespread mistrust of the Ukrainian \njudiciary in 2016, he had “ more than fully accounted for all of the elements of country risk already \nin [his] 3% premium ”: {Day22/33:17} ff. \n888 Unlike Mr Bezant’s quantitative analysis, Mr Kaczmarek’s is a superficial one without \nexplanation of how he reaches the figure of 3% ba"}

For example, he \nnotes that Duff & Phelps reported CRPs of 7.6% for Ukraine and 3.1% for Russia and finds \nit inexplicable that an otherwise identical petrol station operating in Ukraine or Russia would \nhave substantially different valuations, relying on a hypothetical example of a petrol station \nin Crimea before and after the Russian annexation.710 He considers that “ logically, the same \npetrol station should not be materially higher or lower in value if it operates in Ukraine or Russia as risk \nperceptions would largely be equivalent ”.711 That is, with respect, obviously wrong: they are \n \n706  Bezant-Assets2/¶6.61 {D26/1/86}. \n707  Kaczmarek2/¶158 {D21/1/55}. Mr Kaczmarek does not explain why an 18% reduction is sufficient; cf. Mr \nBezant who explains, by reference to the valuation multiples of listed Ukrainian and FTSE 100 companies, \nthat Ukrainian companies trade at much larger discounts than 18% relative to listed companies in other \ncountries: Bezant-Assets2/¶6.59 {D26/1/86}. Mr Kaczmarek also suggests that Mr Bezant’s CRP would \nresult in 131 days’ worth of lost revenue: this is a meaningless comparison, particularly in view of the absence \nof any justification of why 66 days would be acceptable. \n708  Bezant-Assets2/¶6.58 {D26/1/85}. \n709  {Day22/30:1-3}; {Day22/35:15-18}. \n710  Kaczmarek4/¶113 ff {D27/1/37}. Mr Kaczmarek’s analysis is, in any case, flawed. In Table 12 of Kaczmarek4 \n{D27/1/38}, Mr Kaczmarek applies the CRP to the total discount rate (equivalent to the WACC, which \nincludes the cost of debt and equity); however, at Kaczmarek2/¶153 {D21/1/53}, he acknowledges that \ncountry risk should be incorporated in the discount “ as a premium to the cost of equity ” (and not debt). \n711  Kaczmarek4/¶116 {D27/1/38}. Mr Kaczmarek later contradicted this position in XX, stating that there was \n“[f]ar more risk in Russia than in Ukraine ” {Day22/46:8}. \nAA2/15/444\n438 different countries, with different economies, laws and judiciaries; and the tribunal-\nappointed expert in the Crimean Arbitrations proposed a CRP of 2% for Russia and 8% or \n8.8% for Ukraine.

Events of the past 18 months (the risks of which were clear at the \nvaluation date) amply demonstrate why this was appropriate.712 \n(5) Other Petrol Station valuation issues \n(a) Mr Kaczmarek’s market (comparables) valuation  \n891 Given the fraudulent inflation of the volume data relied on by Mr Kaczmarek for his DCF \nvaluation, D1’s Valuation Submissions promoted his market approach: “ whatever may be said \nfor or against the Experts’ de novo valuations on the Income Approach, it remains the case that the Court \nhas a robust Market Approach calculation provided by Mr Kaczmarek ” {AA3/2/14} (¶50).  \n892 His market approach consisted of 14 transactions between 2012 and 2016 for the sale of a \ntotal of 905 petrol stations; and from that he calculated a ‘price per petrol station’ figure for \neach transaction and a weighted average of US$1.1m.713 But it is by no means “ robust ” and, \nindeed, it  is fundamentally flawed:  \n(1) Mr Kaczmarek did not accurately or fairly present the information available to him, \nwith the result that his ‘prices per station’ are substantially overstated. \n(2) Mr Kaczmarek failed to control for, or adjust, his ‘price per station’ based on the \ndifferences between the 246 Petrol Stations and the petrol stations in the comparable \ntransactions (including, in particular, in relation to volumes of fuel sold by the alleged \ncomparable stations for which he had no information); and  \n(3) Mr Kaczmarek ignored the depreciation of the UAH against the USD between 2014 \nand 2016 which caused him to significantly overstate the 2016 UAH value per petrol \nstation implied by his comparables. \n893 Mr Bezant considers there is insufficient evidence to conduct a market valuation because \nthe information about purportedly comparable transactions is limited to the number of \n \n712  Mr Kaczmarek also suggests that Mr Bezant’s CRP of 7.6% conflicts with the latter’s 25% reduction in trading \nmultiples of comparable companies to account for incremental risks associated with Ukraine in his (now \nunchallenged) report on Share Pledges, in which Mr Bezant explained that this reduction can be viewed as a \n3-4% increase in the discount rate ({D27/1/38} (¶117)). Mr Kaczmarek alleges that this is consistent with his \nCRP of 3%: ibid. However, the CRP is a measure of the incremental risk against a significantly lower-risk \ncountry such as the US; whereas the figure of 25% in the Share Pledges Report reflects incremental risks of \noperating in Ukraine compared to the countries in which the comparable companies were located (mostly \nEastern Europe). \n713  Kaczmarek2/¶168 and Table 14 {D21/1/60-61}. \nAA2/15/445\n439 petrol stations sold and the aggregate price, and does not include information on, for \nexample, the volumes of fuel that were being sold.714 \n(i) Mr Kaczmarek’s comparable petrol station network transactions \n894 We address Mr Kaczmarek’s 14 comparable transactions in Appendix N2 . A recurring issue \nis Mr Kaczmarek’s failure to take into account other assets sold as part of the transaction, \nsuch as OSFs and land, thereby overstating the average ‘price per petrol station’ which he \nderives. In other instances, Mr Kaczmarek has used an incorrect transaction price, double-\ncounted a transaction, or used the reported sales prices from a previous transaction in 2005. \nWhen presented with these failures in XX, Mr Kaczmarek doubled down and asserted that \nhis report was not misleading and, if given the chance again, he would not have presented \nthe information any differently {Day22/66:13} - {Day22/71:4}.

These are not the answers \nof an independent witness seeking to assist the Court. By way of example, Mr Kaczmarek \npresented:  \n(1) A 28.5.10 transaction between TNK-BP and Vik Oil as an “ informative ” sale of 118 \npetrol stations in Ukraine at a ‘price per station’ of US$2.65m, calculated as the \nreported aggregate price divided by the number of petrol stations: US$313m / 118 = \nUS$2.65m. In fact, the $313m purchase price included eight OSFs, 49 tankers, 122 \nland plots in various stages of development, “ debt securities ” of the ‘Vik Oil’ group and \n“oil product inventory ” ({D21/36/12-13}). On any view, therefore, the price per station \nwas not US$2.65m – a point Mr Kaczmarek did not identify in his report.  \n(2) A 31.7.15 transaction between MOL and ENI is said to be a sale of 208 petrol stations \nin Romania, the Czech Republic and Slovakia for US$180m (HUF 50bn) at a price per \nstation of US$867,000 (US$180m / 208 = US$867,000 per station) {D21/1/61}. In \nfact, MOL’s accounts record that “ the acquisition also included the companies’ wholesale \nactivities in all three countries and the aviation business in Czech Republic and Slovakia as well ” \nand that the ‘fair value’ of the property plant and equipment included in the acquisition \nwas HUF 33bn. The balance of the HUF 50 bn figure used by Mr Kaczmarek included \nHUF 13.6bn of deferred tax assets, HUF 5.9bn of “ trade and other receivables ”, and HUF \n3.1bn of “ cash and cash equivalent balances acquired ”: {D21/38/183}. The price per station \ncalculated by Mr Kaczmarek was again not fairly presented and was overstated. \n \n714  Bezant-KaczmarekJS/¶7.25 {D25/1/48}; Bezant-Assets1/¶4.85 {D19/1/69}. \n{AA2/24/3}\nAA2/15/446\n440 (3) In the body of his report, Mr Kaczmarek presents a January 2016 transaction for the \nsale of 70 petrol stations in the Czech Republic as giving a price per station of \nUS$2.3m {D21/1/61}. Note 14 to Mr Kaczmarek’s table at {D21/4P/2}, however, \nshows that he has taken a transaction from 2016 by which OMV reportedly sold 68 \npetrol stations, a wind park and cushion gas with a combined fair value of €260m and \nattributed a value to the 68 petrol stations based on a reported value attributed to 70 \npetrol stations sold by BP to OMV in 2005; it also says “ it is not possible to untangle the \nFair Values for these 3 asset groups ”, rendering the comparable useless. Indeed, the true \nposition is even worse: ( i) there is no evidence of the combined €260m fair value Mr \nKaczmarek attributes to the cushion gas, wind park and 68 petrol stations in 2016; ( ii) \nthere is no evidence of the value attributed to the 70 petrol stations in 2005 – Mr \nKaczmarek’s source is a press article which reads “ the value of the deal was not disclosed \nhowever figures from Reuters suggest it could be as much as $161 million ” {D21/36/55}; and \n(iii) there is no evidence that the 68 petrol stations sold in 2016 are the same as those \nacquired by OMV in 2005: {Day22/78:17} - {Day22/79:5}. \n(ii) Failure to adjust for differences between the petrol stations in the comparable transactions \nand the 246 Petrol Stations \n895 Mr Kaczmarek accepted in XX that he had not adjusted for the different characteristics of \nthe petrol stations involved in his comparable transactions and the 246 Petrol Stations, \nnotwithstanding that such adjustments are generally required under all the relevant standards \n{Day22/61:15} - {Day22/62:2}.

Nor did he seek to adjust \nthe price per station where it was clear that the transaction involved a petrol station(s) in \nurban centres (he thus included the one petrol station sold in Belgrade for $3.8m (twice), \nwithout adjustment), or to account for the fact that some of the comparables belonged to \npremium brand networks {Day22/73:14} - {Day22/74:11}. It was symptomatic of his \nunfair presentation of the evidence that he did not even comment on these matters in his \nreport, or suggest the possibility that transactions in EU Member States might lead to higher \nprices than those in Ukraine (by contrast, he was keen to point out extenuating \nAA2/15/447\n441 circumstances which might have explained the lowest ‘price per station’ transactions: \nKaczmarek2/¶¶178-180 {D21/1/63-64}). \n897 As a result, Mr Kaczmarek purported to value 246 Petrol Stations located predominantly in \nUkrainian villages by reference to (for example) the sale price of a petrol station located in \nBelgrade city centre and 190 stations which were mainly located in the much more densely \npopulated (and economically developed) Hungary.715 \n(iii) Currency \n898 Mr Kaczmarek converts his comparable transactions into a USD price per petrol station as \nat the transaction dates, and then generates a weighted average of US$1.1m and a simple \naverage of US$1.6m. He then uses those averages to ascertain a Fair Value per petrol station \nof US$1.25m which he converts to UAH using the 31.12.16 exchange rate, generating a price \nper station of UAH 33m.716 That is a fundamentally flawed exercise:  \n(1) The UAH depreciated significantly against the dollar in the period in which the \ncomparable transactions took place.  \n(2) The effect of Mr Kaczmarek’s approach is to generate a weighted average price of \nUS$1.1m (UAH 30m as at 31.12.16), whereas if the comparable transactions were all \nconverted to UAH as at each transaction date (spanning the period 2012 to 2016), the \nweighted average is c. UAH 18m.717  \n(3) The currency conversion should be done as at the transaction date to avoid the decline \nin the value of the UAH from distorting the UAH price of the petrol stations in the \ncomparable transactions. If that is done, it shows that the price per station is closer to \nMr Bezant’s value (even ignoring the manifold comparables issues described above). \n899 Mr Bezant explained in XX that the Petrol Stations “ generate hryvnia-based revenues, they generate \nhryvnia-based profits. They’re hryvnia-based businesses even if some of their inputs may derive from dollar-\nbased activity. That’s why I think you have to value them in that currency …” {Day19/130:14-24}. \nThat proposition was not seriously challenged.  \n900 Instead, D1 advanced two propositions: as the price in dollars at which petrol stations \npurchased fuel went up (as a result of the depreciation of the UAH) (i) the petrol stations \nwould be able to pass on the entirety of their (dollar-based) costs to their customers, thereby \n \n715  Bezant-Assets2/¶¶7.37-7.53 {D26/1/101-105}. \n716  Kaczmarek2/¶182 {D21/1/64}. \n717  Bezant-Assets2/¶¶7.29-7.36 {D26/1/96}, ¶¶7.57-7.58 {D26/1/106}. \nAA2/15/448\n442 increasing their revenues and (ii) the prof"}

Accordingly, D1 \nsuggested that “ an asset like a petrol station, if you’re looking at it in hryvnia, actually becomes more \nvaluable because the likelihood is that the turnover will go up as the hryvnia declines. The value in US dollar \nterms will stay the same but the value in hryvnia will go up… ” {Day19/138:22} - {Day19/139:1}. \nThat, and D1’s, position was based on a series of false premises: \n(1) As Mr Bezant explained, it is “ unnatural ” {Day19/141:18-20} to suppose that the \npetrol stations could pass on the entirety of their rising costs to consumers, whose \npurchasing power was denominated in UAH. There is evidence that petrol stations \nabsorb c. 50% of the increased costs.718 \n(2) Contrary to Mr Howard KC’s suggestion that petrol is a necessity and so will retain \nits demand regardless of price fluctuations {Day19/133:25} - {Day19/134:7}, there \nis clear evidence that demand for petrol declined between 2014 and 2016 as the UAH \ndepreciated: see {K2-B/15/89} (Veritas 2016 PS Report), {K2-B/4/41} (BT 2016 \nPS Report). The Volyn Restated PS Report records: “[ i]n 2014, due to the devaluation of \nhryvnia and reduction of the purchasing ability, the fuel consumption in Ukraine went down by 11%. \nIn 2015, the gasoline consumption decreased by as much as 27.6%... ” {K2-B/31/13}. The \nnotion that people might use different methods of transport, or not travel at all, if the \nprice of petrol goes up is not in the least surprising. \n(3) There is no evidence that the Petrol Stations charge a fixed percentage mark-up on \ntheir costs such that when their costs rise, they become more profitable. The experts \nhave agreed an average margin for petrol stations is c. 10%, but that is not evidence as \nto how that margin is generated and other valuers have used a lower margin of 7%. \nD1-2 owned these 246 Petrol Stations prior to their transfer and could have provided \nevidence as to whether they charged a percentage margin on their costs; but they \nelected not to produce such evidence. \n901 In the end, this is a simple point. A Ukrainian petrol station generates hryvnia revenues and \nhryvnia profits. Between 2014 and 2016, the Ukrainian economy shrank by 8%; demand for \npetrol fell; and the country was fighting a war against Russia.719 It is unrealistic to suppose \nthat a petrol station would be three times more profitable (and therefore valuable) in 2016 \n \n718  Bezant-Assets1/¶¶A8.15-A8.16 {D19/9/4}; Mr Kaczmarek makes the same assumption {D21/3P/3} (row \n43), referred to by Mr Bezant in evidence at {Day19/143:23} - {Day19/144:1}, {Day20/28:20} - \n{Day20/29:9}.  \n719  {D19/31} (123.9/134.3 – 1 = 8%) \nAA2/15/449\n443 compared to 2014. As Mr Bezant puts it, “ Mr Kaczmarek’s approach implies that, holding all else \nconstant, a Ukrainian petrol station can be worth over three times more in UAH in 2016 than 2013, \ndespite the economic conditions that would have contributed to the extreme currency depreciation.

That is a world away from the values implied by Mr Kaczmarek’s comparables \nand casts serious doubt on his methodology: his assertion that his research was “ more \ncomprehensive than what is done by Volyn here ” is belied by his inaccurate presentation of \ncomparables {Day22/84:8-14}. \n(v) The Crimean comparables \n903 Mr Kaczmarek refers to the value of 47 petrol stations located in Crimea determined in the \nCrimean Arbitrations. He notes that the average value per petrol station awarded by the \ntribunal was US$2.7m (Ukrnafta) and US$1.1m (Stabil).723 Those values are significantly \nhigher than Mr Bezant’s value per Petrol Station (US$300,000) and are closer to Mr \nKaczmarek’s valuation. This is not a proper cross-check: \n \n720  Bezant-Assets2/¶7.35 {D26/1/100}. It is particularly implausible in circumstances in which average fuel sales \nacross Ukraine declined in the period 2014 to 2016: Bezant-Assets1/App. 8/Table A8-3 {D19/9/7} and \nBezant-Assets1/Table 4-6 {D19/1/62}. \n721  Volyn used a DCF for 198 petrol stations but relied on a comparables methodology for three petrol stations \nfor which it did not have supporting data: Bezant-Assets1/¶A7.45 {D19/8/13}; Volyn Restated PS report pp. \n522, 533 and 536 {K2-B/31/121} (row 48); {K2-B/31/132} (row 160); {K2-B/31/135} (row 197). \n722  Veritas 2016 PS Report, p.84 {K2-B/15/84}; Bezant-Assets2/¶7.3 {D26/1/91}.

Those values \nbookend Mr Bezant’s average valuation of the Petrol Stations (UAH 7.6m); and are \nfar lower than Mr Kaczmarek’s average of UAH 34.3m.726 \n(b) Use of hindsight \n904 We addressed the use of hindsight at ¶47 of the Bank’s Valuation Submissions {AA2/5/30}. \nMr Kaczmarek considered it a “ cardinal rule ” of valuation that a valuer may only use \ninformation which was known or knowable as at the valuation date,727 but was prepared to \naccept in XX that, while “ very rare ”, considering post-valuation date information was a \n“possibility ” if there was a “ lack of evidence ” {Day22/48:21} - {Day22/49:2}. \n(6) Conclusion \n905 For the reasons given above, the Court should adopt Mr Bezant’s valuation for the 246 \nPetrol Stations of UAH 1,869m (a c. 70% discount to the Credit Value of UAH 6,341m). \nThe Court should reject Mr Kaczmarek’s valuation of UAH 8,444m (a c. 33% premium to \nthe Credit Value).  \nN4 OSF S \nAsset Credit Value  Restated 2016 \nValue Bezant \nvaluation Kaczmarek \nvaluation Difference \n(Bank / D1 \nvaluation"}

Baker Tilly \ndelivered its reports on 15.10.15 and 11.4.16 (the “BT 2015/2016 OSF Report” ). The \nCredit Values of the OSFs were based on the valuations in the BT 2016 OSF Report. \n907 Mr Bezant valued the OSFs at UAH 538m (91% lower than their Credit Value of UAH \n5,891m); Mr Kaczmarek at UAH 2,499m (58% lower than their Credit Value). \n908 The major issue which divided the experts at the time of their reports was whether the OSFs \nwere operational when transferred to the Bank: \n(1) Mr Kaczmarek valued the OSFs on the basis that they were operational because 70 of \nthe 74 OSFs had throughput volume ascribed to them in the BT 2016 OSF Report.728 \nHe performed a DCF valuation on that basis,729 and provided four cross-checks of his \nvaluation (including against a market comparables approach included in Baker Tilly’s \nreports).730 In XX, Mr Kaczmarek eventually accepted that he had “ doubt” as to the \nOSF’s operationality, said that the Bank may have provided Baker Tilly with “ possible ” \nthroughput volumes (“… I’m not sure if the numbers as presented in the Baker Tilly report are \nactual throughput or potential throughput for the OSF ”) and claimed that, even if they were \nnot operational, they may have been “ capable of operating ”.731 \n(2) Mr Bezant, on the other hand, considered that the level of uncertainty as to the \noperational status of the OSFs was such that a DCF valuation could not be performed. \nInstead, he valued the OSFs by reference to the values at which a sub-set of them \nwere sold by the Bank at auction in 2019. \n909 In its written Valuation Submissions, the Bank set out cogent evidence demonstrating that \nthe data provided to Baker Tilly as to the operational status of the OSFs was falsified within \nBOK by Chernyshov and Plyska (no doubt ultimately on D1-2’s instructions). This, together \nwith other evidence, demonstrated that the OSFs were non-operational. In response: \n(1) D1’s (subsequently filed) Valuation Submissions did not engage with this material at \nall, stating only that Baker Tilly must have been satisfied that the information provided \nby the Bank was reliable {AA3/2/26} ( ¶¶87-88).

The suggested alternative bases are ( i) Mr Bezant’s \napproach based on the subsequent auctions; and ( ii) Mr Kaczmarek’s “ ‘cross-check’ based \nupon Baker Tilly’s market valuation ”. The latter suggestion is clearly a desperate attempt \nto sidestep the overwhelming evidence that the OSFs were not operational. \n(2) D1’s XX of Mr Bezant did not touch upon the operationality documents, nor did it \naddress Mr Kaczmarek’s DCF calculation. Instead, it focused on elevating Mr \nKaczmarek’s market comparables “ cross-check ”, put forward in D1’s Valuation \nSubmissions as an “ alternative basis ”, into a standalone valuation. \n910 The Court should conclude that the OSFs were not operational and that the data relied on \nby Baker Tilly is unreliable. It follows that Mr Kaczmarek’s DCF valuation falls away. In \ndeciding between the two “ alternative bases ”, the problems with Mr Kaczmarek’s market \ncomparables cross-check are, as we explain below, insuperable. In contrast, Mr Bezant’s \nauction-based valuation is robust and might even be said to be generous to D1-2. \n911 In what follows, we address ( i) operationality; ( ii) the issues with Mr Kaczmarek’s DCF \nvaluation and cross-checks; and ( iii) why Mr Bezant’s valuation should be preferred. \n(2) The OSFs were not operational in 2016 \n912 It is clear on the evidence that the vast majority of the OSFs were not operational at the \ntime they were transferred to the Bank. In particular:  \n(1) The vast majority were described as “ non-operational ” in spreadsheets produced by Bank \nemployees in 2015. \n(2) Baker Tilly had significant doubts as to the accuracy of the information provided by \nthe Bank as to the status and capacity of the OSFs, and produced a report that was so \nheavily caveated that it was almost meaningless ( e.g. their valuation “ in no case can be \nconsidered as market value ”). \n(3) The NBU conducted inspections of a sample set of the OSFs shortly after they were \ntransferred to the Bank, concluding in early July 2016 that many were not operating. \nMs Rozhkova’s unchallenged evidence is that they were “ in ruins ” {B1/5/43} ( ¶173). \n(4) Inspections conducted by the Bank’s staff in early 2017 confirmed that virtually all of \nthe OSFs were non-operational. \nAA2/15/453\n447 913 At the beginning of his XX on Day 21 (and having read the Bank’s Valuation Submissions), \nMr Kaczmarek (re-)confirmed his belief that “ there is no reason to doubt that the OSFs were \noperational ” {Day21/9:7-21}. The Bank’s proceeded to put 10 documents to Mr Kaczmarek \nrelating to the operational status of the OSFs. Mr Kaczmarek then conceded that there was, \nin fact, “ doubt” as to whether they were operational. \n914 At ¶¶54-64 of the Bank’s Valuation Submissions {AA2/5/33-45}, we explained that Baker \nTilly was given falsified information about the OSFs in 2015 and 2016.

Some of the falsified \ninformation was manifestly absurd (for example, Baker Tilly expressly pointed out in 2016 \nthat “ the ‘free residual volume of petroleum products in the [Ukrainian ] market is 2 million tonnes, while \nthe Customer provides 5 million tonnes as source data ” and “ the fuel transhipment volume significantly \nexceeds the volume of the tank farm (10 to 500 times), which is not technically possible ” {K2-F/49/1}). \nBOK employees lied to Baker Tilly and the NBU in a bid to conceal the obviously falsified \ndata ( “ if there are any other ideas you can also write them, and then we will discuss, well,  [sales to ] firefighters \nor army! ” {K6/70.02/1}; the OSFs were not operating with the NBU inspected them \nbecause of “ abnormal  high air temperature ” {E14/299}). Subsequent valuation reports and \ninspections by the NBU {E14/309.2}, Veritas {K2-A/5/109} and post-nationalisation \ninspectors {AA2/11} showed that the bulk of the OSFs were non-operational and, in many \ncases, dilapidated. \n915 A good example is the OSF at 111 Polovki Street, Poltava Region: \n(1) Baker Tilly valued this OSF in the BT 2016 OSF Report at UAH 149,174,134 on the \nbasis that it had a dispatch volume for the 11 months of 2015 of 75,102 tonnes and \nwas in “ satisfactory ” condition: {K2-A/4/15} (#146) {K2-A/4/40} (#145). \n(2) The March 2015 OSF Spreadsheet, however, says that the OSF is “ not operating ” and \nascribes no dispatch volume to it for the period January 2014 to February 2015 {K2-\nC/255P/94-95}. It is similarly recorded in the December 2015 OSF Spreadsheet \n(covering the period March 2015 to November 2015) as “ not operating ” with both \nstorage and throughput volumes being zero {K2-C/250P/235-237}. \n(3) The Bank’s 2017 Inspection Report states that the OSF “ has been out of operation for over \n23 years ”, “the roof has fallen off ”, “trees and bushes are growing in the middle  [of the sheds ]”, \n“equipment is rusty ” and “ the pipeline is partially missing ” {K2-F/28.2/1}.  Photos attached \nto that report make the point abundantly clear {K2-F/28.9}, {K2-F/28.11}, {K2-\nF/28.16}, notwithstanding Mr Kaczmarek’s protestations that his “ own Google search ” \nyielded different (but unevidenced) results {Day21/41:16-22}.  \nAA2/15/454\n448 (3) Mr Kaczmarek accepts that there are “ doubts ” about the OSFs’ operationality \n916 At the start of his XX, Mr Kaczmarek confirmed that, having read the Bank’s Valuation \nSubmissions, that he continued to believe that the “ data provided to Baker Tilly… clearly indicates \nthe OSFs were operational ” and that Mr Bezant had adopted an “ excessive level of scepticism ”.732 \nThis significantly undermined his credibility. \n917 Mr Kaczmarek initially tried to maintain this line during his XX, but eventually relented \nwhen the Court intervened:  \n(1) He refused to agree that only seven of the 74 OSFs were recorded as operating in the \nMarch 2015 OSF Spreadsheet, suggesting that those which recorded stored fuel (but \nnot throughput) and which were recorded as non-operational should be considered as \n“operating businesses ” {Day21/12:10}; {Day21/13:7-8}. But Mr Kaczmarek provided \nno evidence as to revenue for fuel storage (if any) and his DCF valuation is based on \nthroughput not storage. Further, the March 2015 Spreadsheet records only six OSFs \nas storing fuel without any throughput; in each of those cases, the volume of fuel \nstored represents between 0.13% and 2.92% of the OSF’s purported capacity.733 \n(2) Similar points were made by Mr Kaczmarek in respect of the December 2015 OSF \nSpreadsheet: he refused to agree that – on its face – it "}

He said (implausibly) \nthat he did not draw the Court’s attention to this extraordinary caveat because the \nreport “ speaks for itself `” {Day21/33:24-25}, and raised (for the first time) the \npossibility that the Bank had provided Baker Tilly with “ possible ” throughput volumes: \n“…I’m not sure if the numbers as presented in the Baker Tilly report are actual throughput or \npotential throughput for the OSF ” {Day21/30:5-14}.  \n(6) Though he initially hedged it with qualifications, Mr Kaczmarek finally accepted that \nthere were doubts as to operationality:  \n“Q. You seem to be focusing this morning on ‘capable of operating’. That phrase has \ncome around a few times, ‘The OSFs were capable of operating’. But actually, if one \ngoes back to your first report, {D27/1/51}, you say, top of the page: ‘ Accordingly, I \nbelieve there is no reason to doubt that the OSFs were operational  ...’  \nA.

And his \nindependence is further undermined by his specious argument that, because the Petrol \nStations were operating, the OSFs must have been too.736 The point is obviously wrong:  \n(1) There is no evidence that, prior to the Asset Transfer, the 74 OSFs were used as \nstorage facilities by the 246 Petrol Stations.737  \n(2) Whether the Petrol Stations needed to use the OSFs for fuel storage would depend \nupon factors including ( i) the storage facilities available at the Petrol Stations \n \n735  {Day21/26:3-5}; {Day21/26:20} - {Day21/27:1}. \n736  Kaczmarek2/¶¶42, 102 {D21/1/18}, {D21/1/37}. \n737  Bezant-Assets2/¶9.16 {D26/1/124}. \nAA2/15/456\n450 themselves, and ( ii) the distance between the OSFs and the Petrol Stations. In fact, \nthe OSFs and the Petrol Stations were geographically dispersed, which would suggest \nthat the Petrol Stations did not rely on the OSFs for fuel supplies (whereas they could \nhave obtained fuel from other OSFs which were not transferred to the Bank).738 \n(3) Mr Kaczmarek asserts that it “ defies rational economic behaviour ” if the Petrol Stations \n(owned by the Bank) obtained their fuel from OSFs other than those which were also \nowned by the Bank.739 But the OSFs and the Petrol Stations were not operated by the \nBank after the Asset Transfer: they were leased out to D1-2’s companies {E14/177.1} \n{E14/177.2P}. \n(4) Mr Kaczmarek’s point did not withstand challenge in XX. He accepted that the 2017 \nInspection Reports showed that the transferred Petrol Stations in various regions were \noperational notwithstanding the dilapidated state of the OSFs.740 He also accepted that \nit was possible that fuel could be delivered directly from a refinery in Poltava – a factor \nhe acknowledged he had left out from his report {Day21/53:2-20} – or from a \npipeline from Belarus, both of which would obviate or reduce the need for the OSFs \nto ensure the operation of the Petrol Stations. \n(5) Mr Kaczmarek was also unable to identify the minimum number of OSFs necessary \nto service the 246 Petrol Stations but acknowledged that “ in theory, depending on the size \nof them ”, just five OSFs could potentially do so ({Day21/59:10-14}).  \n(4) Mr Kaczmarek’s DCF and cross-checks \n919 It is clear that the vast majority of OSFs were not operational in 2016 and, indeed, had \nalready been out of action for a number of years. Mr Kaczmarek’s DCF is therefore \nuntenable because it is based on ( i) false throughput data and ( ii) an assumption that the \nOSFs were operational. \n920 This is not the only flaw in his DCF approach: ( i) he also uses assumptions as to EBITDA \nmargin (49%) and maintenance capital expenditure which are not supported by proper \n \n738  Bezant-Assets2/¶¶9.18 – 9.26 {D26/1/124}. \n739  Kaczmarek2/¶102 {D21/1/37}. \n740  {Day21/54:17}. The inspection reports record in a number of instances that petrol stations were being \noperated by their lessees, whereas the OSFs were not: see e.g. (i) 23.3.17 inspection report {K2-F/29.01} (13 \nOSFs leased to six separate lessees recorded as not operating; five petrol stations leased to Slima Trade LLC \nrecorded as operating) and ( ii) 25.3.17 inspection report {K2-F/29.2} (three OSFs leased to Strong Bridge \nAlliance LLC recorded as not operating; five petrol stations leased to Strong Bridge Ltd recorded as operating). \nIt is inherently improbable that the lessees independently chose to operate th"}

These are: ( i) a \ncomparison of his implied EV/EBITDA multiple with an industry average; ( ii) his valuation \nof two OSFs in the Crimean Arbitrations; ( iii) a 52% downward adjustment made by EY; \nand ( iv) Baker Tilly’s comparables approach.742 As noted above, in light of the overwhelming \nevidence that the OSFs were not operational, D1 has now suggested that the last of these \ncross-checks ( i.e. BT’s comparables approach) could be used as an alternative basis to value \nall 74 OSFs. We address these cross-checks below. \n(a) EV/EBITDA multiples \n922 Mr Kaczmarek’s calculation of earnings was based on the throughput data in the BT 2016 \nOSF Report. If that data is wrong, so too is his earnings calculation and any multiple derived \nfrom it. Indeed, he accepted this: “[ i]t’s the principle of garbage in, garbage out ” {Day21/63:5-6}. \n(b) Valuation of the OSFs in the Crimean Arbitrations \n923 In his report, Mr Kaczmarek stated that: “[ m]y Fair Value conclusion also implies an average value \nper-OSF value of US$ 1,210,959. This per-facility value is consistent with the range I previously calculated \nwhen valuing storage facilities in Crimea at approximately US$ 1.17 million per facility ”.743 Mr \nKaczmarek did not go on to explain that, in the Crimean Arbitration involving the Stabil \npetrol stations, the tribunal had not accepted his valuation and had instead awarded \nUS$871,000 for each of the two OSFs being valued ( i.e. 25% less): see {D26/22/125}. \n924 Mr Kaczmarek’s approach in this regard significantly undermined his credibility.  \n(1) The Stabil award was not publicly available at the time of Mr Kaczmarek’s report, such \nthat neither the Court nor the Bank could have known that Mr Kaczmarek’s valuation \nhad not been accepted. \n(2) Mr Kaczmarek confirmed that he had previously received and read the award.744 In \nXX, Mr Kaczmarek did not accept that the passage from his report set out above was \nmisleading or that it was a significant error not to draw the tribunal’s downward \nadjustment to his own valuation to the Court’s attention.745  \n \n741  Bezant-Assets2/¶¶9.42-9.48 {D26/1/131}. \n742  Kaczmarek2/¶¶208-209 {D21/1/73-74}. \n743  Kaczmarek2/¶208 {D21/1/73}. \n744  {Day21/64:2-12}. \n745  {Day21/68:22-24}; {Day21/69:8-11}. \nAA2/15/458\n452 (3) Indeed, when asked whether he should have done so, his evidence was: “[ t]hat presumes \nI agree with the tribunal’s ultimate decision on the valuation, which in most cases I don’t. […] I \nindicated here in this paragraph what I presented to the tribunal as my absolute opinion on what those \nfacilities were worth ” {Day21/67:19} - {Day21/68:5}. \n925 This is a further example of Mr Kaczmarek failing to comply with his duty as an expert. \n(c) EY’s downward adjustment \n926 Mr Kaczmarek noted that his valuation was 58% lower than the Credit Value ascribed to \nthe OSFs, which was “ in line with the 52 percent downward adjustment made in the EY Report ”. \nWhen it was pointed out to him that EY had concluded that the value of the OSFs was “ 50-\n85% less than the value determined at the time of the last valuation ” {E16/179/43}, Mr Kaczmarek \nacknowledged that “ an 85% adj"}

We set out the entirety of Mr Kaczmarek’s analysis below: \n“As a final reasonableness check, I note that Baker Tilly used the comparable transaction \napproach to value two assets for which no throughput data was provided. Baker Tilly \ndetermined that buyers of comparable assets could be expected to pay US$ 136 per tonne of \nstorage tank capacity. The 72 OSFs that were transferred to the Bank had a total tank capacity \nof 522,775 tonnes. Therefore, Baker Tilly’s comparable transaction analysis implies a value of \nUS$ 71.1 million for the OSFs, which is within 18 percent of the Fair Value conclusion I \nreached using the Income Approach.”  {D21/1/73} \n928 D1’s belated attempt to turn these four sentences of text into the bedrock of his OSF \nvaluation is hopeless. \n929 First, Baker Tilly’s analysis takes the advertised sale prices for five OSFs and seeks to arrive \nat a cost per tonne of storage capacity for a 9,000 tonne OSF in Kyiv which had the benefit \nof railway tracks {K2-A/4/37}. This is not remotely comparable to the OSFs in our case: \n(1) The OSFs were in a state of disarray. Compare Baker Tilly’s comparables, which \ninclude small deductions of between 3% and 5% for their “ Technical Condition ”. \n \n746  {Day21/78:16-17}; {Day21/79:21-23}. \nAA2/15/459\n453 (2) D1’s reliance on the Baker Tilly analysis also assumes that there was a market for the \nstorage capacity offered by the OSFs. This is highly doubtful: they were presumably \nmothballed and left to rack and ruin because there was no demand for them.  \n(3) They were geographically dispersed, and not in the capital. \n930 Secondly, Mr Kaczmarek accepted that the Baker Tilly comparables were anything but \nrobust: \n(1) He accepted that he did not know whether Baker Tilly’s comparable OSFs were \noperational or non-operational and, in the latter case, whether any work would be \nrequired to put them into operation {Day21/71:15-24}. \n(2) He also acknowledged that Baker Tilly’s reports do not provide any information as to \nthe throughput of the comparable OSFs {Day21/72:2}. The purported throughput \nfor 11 months of 2015 for the OSFs in the BT 2016 OSF Report varies from 2% of \ntheir capacity up to an improbable 25 times their capacity.747 Clearly, a comparable that \nmakes use of its full capacity would not be appropriate for an OSF that processes at \nmost 2% of its capacity over 11 months (and vice versa ). \n(3) He accepted that the comparables were offers for sale and not concluded transactions \n{Day21/73:17-19}. While the BT 2016 OSF Report (dated April 2016) records the \ndate of the offers as December 2015 and includes a 20% “ auction ” (sc. negotiation) \ndiscount (but a 0% adjustment for “ offer date ”), the BT 2015 OSF Reports (valuing the \nOSFs as at 1.4.15) include the same five comparable OSFs with an offer date of March \n2015 and the same 20% discount: e.g. {K2-A/1/45}. If the OSFs remained on the \nmarket for 13 months, it can be safely assumed that they were priced too high. \n(4) Mr Bezant was unable fully to understand “ precise scorings and percentages ” by which BT \nadjusted the comparables {Day19/155:19} ff and Mr Kaczm"}

Thus, Petroleum Tank Farm_1_1 is given a value of \nUS$107/tonne on account of its poor location and storage capacity {K2-A/4/37}. \nIndeed, in the three BT 2015 OSF Reports in the trial bundle, a number are valued on \nthe basis of US$101, US$103 and US$105/tonne of capacity: {K2-A/1/45}, {K2-\nA/2/71} and {K2-A/3/92}. \n(2) Mr Kaczmarek agreed that Baker Tilly had made such adjustments, and that he had \nnot: “ No, my Lord. I’ve just used the 136 in that paragraph 208 that I referred to. I’ve never made \nadjustments like this ” {Day21/77:5-7}. \n(3) Mr Bezant summarised the problems with the Baker Tilly/Kaczmarek analyses thus: \n“Q. ... 136 per tonne of capacity is at least a reasonable proxy, .... What would you say \nto that?  \nA. So I would say a number of things. I would say this is a set of five offers that never \nresulted in an actual transaction price and so, to that extent, notwithstanding that Baker \nTilly is trying to allow for that, they’re not actual transaction data, they’re guide prices. \nI would say that there’s five of them. They hadn’t sold in the last year or so, based on \nan earlier report. I would say that you then need to take the median and, as I said, re-\nperform this exercise -- and this is what Baker Tilly do, I think -- for each of the other \nsubject assets to recalibrate. The median is as applies to Kyiv. It’s not as applies to all \nof the other subject assets where you have to go through the same exercise. So that’s \nwhat you would need to do rather than use the 136.” {Day19/158:13} -\n{Day19/159:14}. \n(5) Mr Bezant’s use of auction prices to value the OSFs \n932 In light of ( i) the absence of reliable information about the operational status of the OSFs \n(which makes a DCF valuation impossible), ( ii) the experts’ agreement that there are no \nappropriate company comparables (such that it is not possible to conduct a market \nvaluation),748 and ( iii) the shortcomings of a transactions comparables approach set out \nabove, Mr Bezant has valued the OSFs by reference to the price of a subset of them that \nwere sold at auction in 2019. Importantly, he refers to actual transactions (his approach is \ndescribed at ¶¶67-71 of the Bank’s Valuation Submissions {AA2/5/47-50}). \n933 The results of Mr Bezant’s valuation exercise can be compared to the other reported \nvaluations of the OSFs:  \nAsset Credit Value Restated 2016 \nValue Bezant \nValue Kaczmarek \nValue \nOriginal 72 OSFs UAH 5,685m UAH 312m UAH 521m UAH 2,426m \n \n748  Bezant-KaczmarekJR/¶8.6 {D25/1/55}. \nAA2/15/461\n455 Further 2 OSFs UAH 206m UAH 13m UAH 18m UAH 73m \n934 At ¶¶70-71 of the Bank’s Valuation Submissions {AA2/5/49}, we set out the limitations of \nMr Bezant’s approach and responded to Mr Kaczmarek’s crit"}

D1’s challenge \nof Mr Bezant’s approach was significantly more limited: \n(1) Mr Howard KC put to Mr Bezant that the data he had was “ imperfect ”. Mr Bezant had \nalready said as much (“ I recognise that my valuation is subject to important limitations ” \n{D19/1/96}); and confirmed in XX that it had limitations {Day19/158:12}. \n(2) Mr Howard KC did not suggest that the auction prices were wrong, or should be \nexcluded because they post-dated the valuation date: “[ w]hat I suggest to you is that it’s too \nnarrow a view to simply look at the auctions in 2019, even if that is a relevant piece of data to look \nat, but one also needs to look at the data you can glean from Baker Tilly and from Veritas ” \n{Day19/161:11-16}.  \n(3) As Mr Bezant pointed out, those reports are inconsistent as between themselves  \n{Day19/161:25} - {Day19/162:4} and, while his valuation is lower than the valuation \nsuggested by the comparables approach in the reports from those two valuers, it is \nconsistent with other valuations of the OSFs which have been performed since 2017 \n{Day19/162:11-14}. Critically, it also reflects actual transactions: the fact that these \nwere amounts paid for the OSFs in issue in these proceedings is not in dispute.  \n935 Indeed, Mr Bezant’s analysis is rigorous and fair: he applies a 470% premium to the price \nper unit capacity multiple at which the 23 OSFs were sold at auction before the pandemic \nwhen valuing the remaining OSFs (to account for potential differences between the different \nsets of OSFs): {AA2/5/48-49} (¶68(5)-(6)). This means that the Bank will (generally) give \ncredit for a higher sum than it has actually received from the post-pandemic auctions (and \nwhere an OSF sold for more than the value ascribed to it by Mr Bezant, the Bank has agreed \nto give credit for the auction proceeds: Reply/¶28K.4 {A1/25/57})  \n(6) Conclusion \n936 For the reasons set out above, the Court should adopt Mr Bezant’s valuation of UAH 538m \nfor the 74 OSFs and reject Mr Kaczmarek’s DCF valuation, which assumes that the OSFs \nwere operational, of UAH 2,499m. \nAA2/15/462\n456 N5 REAL ESTATE (STADIUM , TRAINING CENTRE , HOTELS , OFFICES AND AIRFIELD ) \n(1) Mr Kaczmarek’s reliance on the NBU Values \n937 D1 and Mr Kaczmarek put a great deal of weight on the NBU’s ‘verification’ of the value of \nthe Stadium, the Training Centre, the Dnipro and Kyiv Offices and the Airfield.749 There are \nat least five problems with this approach. \n938 First, the position of Mr Kaczmarek (and D1 more generally) is fundamentally inconsistent: \n(1) Mr Kaczmarek adopts NBU ‘verified’ values in relation to the Stadium, the Kyiv and \nDnipro Offices, the Training Centre and the Airfield. But he rejects the NBU ‘verified’ \nvalue for Hotel Zirka, on account of “ clear errors present in the valuation analysi s” and relies \ninstead on Mr Bezant’s DCF valuation {D20/1/67} (¶214-215). The report in \nquestion was produced by Veritas. \n(2) More generally, D1’s aircraft valuer Mr Seymour also rejects various Veritas reports \non which the NBU’s ‘verified’ value for the Aircraft appears to be based. As the \nAircraft Joint Statement explains, Veritas’ methodology “ which assess [es] the Aircraft in \nparts and not as a whole, is against the accepted industry practice and produces an unreliable \nvaluation ” {D15/2/25} (¶8.2). \n(3) Yet Mr Kaczmarek is content to adopt NBU ‘verified’ values in relation to other \nproperties.

They include the Stadium and Training Centre, where those ‘verified’ \nvalues are also based on Veritas reports. \n939 Secondly, there are manifest errors in the reports relied upon for the NBU’s ‘verified’ values. \nMost obviously, the 2016 valuers valued the Stadium, Training Centre and Airfield using \nexclusively the cost approach without adjusting for economic obsolescence or impairment, \nwhich Mr Kaczmarek accepted was a necessary factor to take into account. 750 The reports \nalso contained clear absurdities: the Kreston Airfield report valued 138 hectares of scrubland \nas if it were a huge warehouse; and the Veritas Stadium report valued an eight-year-old \nSamsung 40-inch TV at US$110,000. Indeed, Mr Kaczmarek’s approach was to emphasise \nthe professionalism of the 2016 valuers when it suited him {Day22/138:15-21} but \n \n749  See D1’s Valuation Submissions/¶¶3-20 {AA3/2/2}; Kaczmarek1/¶255 {D20/1/79}; Kaczmarek3/¶¶10-12 \n{D24/1/8}; Thomas XX {Day20/44:6} - {Day20/47:2}; Kaczmarek XX {Day22/101:2-5}. \n750  IFRS 13, on which Mr Kaczmarek relies, provides: “ From the perspective of a market participant seller, the price that \nwould be received for the asset is based on the cost to a market participant buyer to acquire or construct a substitute asset of \ncomparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence. That is because a market participant buyer would not pay more for an asset than the \namount for which it could replace the service capacity of that asset. […] Obsolescence encompasses physical deterioration, functional \n(technological) obsolescence and economic (external) obsolescence... ” (emphasis added) quoted at Thomas2/¶4.32 \n{D23/1/18}. \nAA2/15/463\n457 otherwise to disparage their experience in comparison to his own (“ I have far more experience \ninternationally, I’m sure, than these local valuation firms ” {Day22/64:20-21}). \n940 Thirdly, the NBU never formed a concluded view as to value of these assets: ( i) Resolution \n103/BT required the assets transferred to the Bank to be “ subject to verification ” of their fair \nvalue by the NBU {E12/313/2}; ( ii) Ms Rozhkova’s unchallenged evidence is that \nverification involved the NBU accepting a report produced by a firm of valuers approved \nby the NBU: {B1/5/42} (¶168) (that is consistent with the EY Report, which states that \n“Validation was performed through receipt of reports of independent valuers under tripartite agreements ” \n{E16/179/13}); ( iii) the IMF September 2016 Memorandum provided that the NBU would \nneed to complete verification of the transferred assets by the end of September 2016 to \nensure “ proper valuation: the value of assets received as loan repayments or new loan collateral reflects true \nmarket prices ” {E15/125/81-82}; and ( iv) in late September 2016, the NBU decided that the \nBank should appoint an international auditor to review its compliance with the Restructuring \nPlan, including the value of the transferred assets: {B1/5/54}(¶220). Resolution 323-rsh/BT \ndated 5.10.16 provided that the purpose of EY’s appointment was inter alia  “verification of the \nadequacy and quality of the measures taken by the Bank to comply with ... Resolution 103/BT ” \n{E15/303/1} and EY prepared desktop valuations of the Transferred Assets as part of its \nreport. \n941 So, by early October 2016, the NBU was clearly not prepared to accept the assets’ valuations \neven if they were included in a tripartite valuation report.

This can be seen most obviously \nfrom the fact that the EY Report did not confirm any of the Credit Values or NBU ‘verified’ \nvalues {E16/179/40-45}. Instead, they opined as follows: \nAsset NBU ‘verified’ figures and EY’s comments \nStadium The Credit Value was UAH 1,517m; the NBU ‘verified’ figure was UAH \n1,544m;751 EY recommended a revaluation, which “ must include the income-base [d] \napproach ” {E16/179/45}. \nKyiv Office  The Credit Value was UAH 322m; the NBU ‘verified’ figure was UAH 245m; \nhere, EY said that “[ a]ccording to the desk review results the value range was corrected to \nUAH 201-235 million ” {E16/179/43}. \nDnipro \nOffice The Credit Value was UAH 452m; the NBU ‘verified’ figure was UAH 212m; EY \n“corrected ” the value range to UAH 181-194m {E16/179/43}. \nTraining \nCentre The Credit Value was UAH 671m; the NBU ‘verified’ figure was UAH 332m; EY \nrecommended a revaluation, which “ must include an income approach ” \n{E16/179/45}. \n \n751  The EY report records the NBU ‘verified’ value for Stadium as both UAH 1,544m and UAH 1,543m \n{E16/179/45}, {E16/179/89}. The discrepancy appears to be due to inconsistency in rounding.  \nAA2/15/464\n458 Airfield The Credit Value was UAH 366m; the NBU ‘verified’ figure was UAH 34m; EY \nsaid that it was unable to comment, as ( inter alia ) “the income approach needs to be used \nas a check for depreciation ” {E16/179/45}. \n942 Against that background, it is unsurprising that EY’s qualification to the Bank’s 2016 \nfinancial statements states that “ we were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence in respect \nof the fair value of repossessed properties ” {K1/6/4}. \n943 D1 and Mr Kaczmarek are therefore right to say that the NBU took its role in checking the \nvalue of the assets seriously. That is what led it to require the appointment of EY. In those \ncircumstances, the proposition that the Court should place weight on the NBU ‘verification’ \nprocess or simply accept the NBU ‘verified’ values – irrespective of the concerns expressed \nby EY – is misconceived. \n944 Fourthly, the experts agree that they have little information on what ‘verification’ the NBU, \nin fact, undertook, beyond the receipt of the valuation reports on which the NBU was \ncontractually entitled to rely ({D22/1/10}  (¶6.1), {D25/1/8} (¶3.7)). Indeed, in respect of \nthe Kyiv Office, Mr Kaczmarek adopts the NBU ‘verified’ value which is 18% higher than \nthe contemporaneous valuation commissioned by the Bank and the NBU, despite having \nseen no analysis explaining this uplift {D27/1/16} (¶39). Mr Kaczmarek’s reliance on the \nNBU values sits uneasily with his emphasis on the need for valuations to be based on \nobservable inputs: {D20/1/12-13} (¶¶29-30), {D20/1/27-32} (¶¶80-99 esp. 93-4, 98). \n945 Fifthly, Mr Kaczmarek has not undertaken the task that was envisaged by Mann J in June \n2020 in any meaningful way, viz. to address issues of the “ value of the assets transferred to the \nBank by the Asset Transfer ” {A6/46/4} (¶15(2)). Adopting (in some, but not all, cases) a value \n‘verified’ by an entity other than the Bank, and when the ‘verifying’ party clearly had ongoing \nconcerns, sheds no light on the question that arises for determination here. This is especially \nso where many of the verified figures emanated from Veritas, a valuer whose August 2016 \nconclusions have been accepted by Messrs Kaczmarek and Seymour to be seriously \ndeficient. \n(2) The Stadium \nAsset Credit Value  Restated \n2016 Value Thomas \nvaluation Kaczmarek \nvaluation Difference \n(Bank / D1 \nvaluations) \nStadium UAH 1,517m UAH 16m UAH 125m UAH 1,544m UAH "}

If the seller gets no \noffers for UAH 1.5bn, he will not sell the asset. That is not the definition of a willing \nseller.753 More generally, Mr Kaczmarek considered the hypothetical transaction as one \nin which the buyer would “ win” if the price was less than the construction cost \n{Day22/134:9} - {Day22/135:12}. In a hypothetical transaction, there is no “ winner ” \nor “loser”: the value of the asset is the price and if the value/price is lower than the \ncost of construction (which it may, in any case, have been irrational to incur) then that \nis simply a function of a free market. \n(2) The second assertion was based on the premise that a football club has to own a \nstadium in order to generate revenue from merchandising and television revenue. That \nproposition formed the basis of much of Mr Thomas’s XX (see {Day20/66:6-13}, \n{Day20/69:16-21}) but it was subsequently disclaimed by Mr Kaczmarek \n \n752  Thomas-KaczmarekJR/¶¶2.4-2.5 {D22/1/4}, Kaczmarek1/¶¶72-74 {D20/1/25}. \n753  IVS 2013 defines a willing seller as “ neither an over eager nor a forced seller prepared to sell at any price, nor one prepared \nto hold out for a price not considered reasonable in the current market. The willing seller is motivated to sell the asset at market \nterms for the best price attainable in the open market after proper marketing, whatever that price may be ” {D23/6/15}. \nAA2/15/466\n460 {Day22/129:2-9}.

It was quite obviously a false basis on which to put questions to \nMr Thomas: Premier League teams, such as Tottenham Hotspur, have rented their \nstadiums: {Day22/128:22-25}.754  \n(3) That false premise was the basis for a further assertion that the Stadium would have \nspecial or synergistic value for someone who already owned a football club because it \nwould allow the club owner to generate revenues which would otherwise be \nunavailable to him. That is wrong as a matter of fact; but even if it were right, the \nhypothetical purchaser for whom the Stadium has special or synergistic value is a \nspecial purchaser. As the IVS guidance makes clear, “ market value requires disregard of any \nelement of special value because at any given date it is only assumed there is a willing buyer, not a \nparticular willing buyer ” {D8/44/16}, a statement with which Mr Kaczmarek agreed \n{Day22/130:2-20}755. \n949 Mr Howard KC and Mr Kaczmarek sought to buttress their approach by asserting that it \nwould be irrational to build a stadium for €65m if its value immediately after construction \nwas only US$5m: {Day20/60:1-7}, {Day22/135:17-24}. But ( i) as Mr Kaczmarek accepted, \nit can often be the case that property costs more to build than it is subsequently sold for ( e.g. \nwhere the builder is forced to sell in a recession: see {Day22/136:20-25}); and ( ii) the \nStadium may have been worth €65m immediately after construction if it could sell every seat \nevery weekend of the season at sustainably high ticket prices and host multiple non-football \nevents. No statistics are available going back to 2008, but by 2015-16 the Stadium only sold \n25% of its capacity for matches (down from 56% in 2012-13). See {K2-E/32/24} (ticket \nprices and revenue denominated in UAH): \n \n \n754  See e.g. https://www.propertyweek.com/news-analysis/who-owns-premier-league-stadiums/5090883.article. \n755  See also Kaczmarek1/¶74 {D20/1/25}, where Mr Kaczmarek explains that Fair Value is also a ‘market based’ \nmeasure so does not take account of “ the perspective of a specific buyer or seller ”.  \nAA2/15/467\n461 (b) The Veritas valuation  \n950 Mr Kaczmarek’s valuation adopts the costs approach used in the Veritas report at {K2-\nE/32} which he describes as a “ robust and well-supported implementation of the Cost Approach ” \n{D24/1/42} (Kaczmarek3/¶118) – a view he doubled-down on in XX (“ I believe it is very \nrobust ” {Day22/101:2}). In fact, the Veritas valuation is fundamentally flawed:  \n(1) Veritas used a long list of purported invoices or contracts for the original construction \nof the Stadium (which Mr Kaczmarek has not seen {Day22/91:10-13}) and indexed \n(by a factor of 370%) those original costs from 2007-8 to 2016 to generate a notional \nfigure for the reconstruction of the Stadium of UAH 1.125bn. Mr Kaczmarek accepts \nthat these are Level 3 ( i.e. unobservable) inputs to the valuation: Kaczmarek3/¶30 \n{D24/1/14}. As Mr Thomas points out, an indexation factor of 370% is inherently \nunreliable because “ too much of the value comes from the indexation process ” {Day20/105:19} \n- {Day20/106:1}. \n(2) Veritas then used a long list of purported 2006-8 invoices or contracts with Hochtief \nConstruction for the ‘cost of equipment’ at the Stadium and indexed those up to 2016 \nto generate a notional cost of replacing the equipment {K2-E/32/40}. That process \nresults in some obvious absurdities, such as the UAH 120,584 (US$5k) potato peeler \n{K2-E/32/54} and the UAH 2.8m ($110k) 8-year old 40-inch Samsung TV {K2-\nE/32/66}. \n(3) Veritas purported to account for physical, functional and economic depreciation {K2-\nE/32/68}. They did so by reference to Marshall & Swift depreciation tables, which \nmandate a 5% depreciation rate for eight-year-old non-residential real estate with a \nstandard service life of 50 years.

Mr Kaczmarek’s unrealistic \nattempt to support Veritas’s approach on this issue on the basis that 5% was an overall \ndepreciation rate ignored the fact that Veritas should have depreciated different \nelements of the cost differently: {Day22/99:17} - {Day22/101:15}. \n951 More importantly, the Marshall & Swift depreciation rates do not take into account \neconomic depreciation: see {D23/6/25} (accepted by Mr Kaczmarek {Day22/101:21-22}). \nOn economic depreciation (or obsolescence):  \nAA2/15/468\n462 (1) There is no dispute that a costs approach valuation must be adjusted to reflect \neconomic obsolescence.756 Mr Kaczmarek agreed in XX that the Veritas report does \nnot include a reduction in value for economic depreciation (a fact which he had not \nmentioned in his written report: Kaczmarek3/¶¶112-113 {D24/1/39}). He said that \n“the fact that [Veritas ] didn’t account for it could simply mean they didn’t believe any economic \nobsolescence was appropriate ” {Day22/103:4-7}. It is clear, however, that Veritas \nerroneously thought they were accounting for economic obsolescence by using \nMarshall & Swift’s tables: see “ In order to take account the impact of ... economic depreciation \n... the Appraiser considers it correct ... to use the data from ... Marshall and Swift ” {K2-\nE/32/68}. \n(2) There are a number of factors which contributed to the Stadium’s economic \nobsolescence in 2016 in particular ( i) declining attendance, declining ticket prices, and \ndeclining revenues (see the table and graphs at {K2-E/32/24}); ( ii) UEFA’s ban on \nusing the Stadium for European matches; and ( iii) the war in eastern Ukraine.757 Mr \nKaczmarek appeared to accept that ( i) and ( ii) were relevant to the asset’s impairment \n{Day22/107:12} - {Day22/108:12}, {Day22/110:18-21} but suggested that the war \nin eastern Ukraine could have enhanced the Stadium’s value. That is a surprising \nproposition for which there was no evidence beyond Mr Kaczmarek’s speculation that \ndisplaced teams from the Donbas may have wished to relocate to Dnipro. \n(3) Mr Kaczmarek accepted as a matter of principle that where an asset such as a hotel \nhad a much-reduced occupancy rate, that would “ obviously cause a decline in value ” which \nwould lead the asset to be impaired {Day22/104:18-23}. He also accepted that, on \nthe cost approach, it is necessary to take account of economic depreciation or \nimpairment: {Day22/108:23} - {Day22/109:2}. But he was extremely evasive when \npressed as to how a valuer would take impairment or economic obsolescence into \naccount on such an approach: {Day22/106:4-20}, {Day22/111:5} - {Day22/114:6}. \nHis assertion that economic obsolescence is “ subjective ” did not assist the Court to \nunderstand the methodology by which economic obsolescence should be quantified. \n(4) The reason for Mr Kaczmarek’s evasiveness was clear: the proper way to assess \neconomic obsolescence or impairment of an asset is to value it on a market \n \n756  See IFRS 13 and fn. above. \n757  As Mr Thomas pointed out to Mr Howard KC, Russia “ already had invaded Ukraine [in 2014 ] and UEFA took a \ndecision that football teams from the UEFA league were not allowed as a matter of security to play in Dnipro Stadium ” \n{Day20/67:21} - {Day20/68:10}. \nAA2/15/469\n463 (comparables) or income approach to check that its depreciated cost fairly reflects its \ntrue market value.

In circumstances in which a comparables approach is not possible, \nthat means economic obsolescence or impairment must be assessed by carrying out \nan income approach valuation. That is Mr Thomas’ view: Thomas2/¶4.37 \n{D23/1/21}, {Day20/56:22} -{Day20/57:13}758 and it was EY’s view (“ EY is of the \nview that the cost approach with an asset impairment test should be used as the primary basis for this \nvaluation…given the difficulty with selecting comparables, in our view, the income approach is the \nbetter fit ” {E16/179/260}). And Mr Kaczmarek himself accepted that an income \napproach would, by its very nature, capture any economic obsolescence \n{Day22/105:22} - {Day22/106:3}. \n(5) Mr Kaczmarek’s willingness to stand by Veritas’ cost approach – without any attempt \nto cross-check it against notional income streams – was all the more surprising in light \nof (i) the extensive professional guidance cautioning against the use of the cost \napproach as the sole valuation technique;759 and ( ii) professional guidance indicating \nthat properties such as the Stadium are generally valued on an income approach.760 \n952 Mr Kaczmarek’s assertion that the Veritas report is a “ robust ” implementation of the cost \napproach cannot survive his acceptance that the Stadium was an impaired asset; that \nimpairment should be reflected in the valuation; and that the Veritas report did not factor \nin economic obsolescence or impairment. The Veritas report should be disregarded. \n(c) Income approach \n953 It is agreed between the experts that ( i) the highest and best use of the Stadium is as a sports \nstadium;761 and ( ii) the main revenues and costs of operating the Stadium are those taken \ninto account in Mr Thomas’ DCF valuation at Thomas1/¶4.66 {D18/1/52} (revenues: \nticket sales, advertising, parking, rent of office space/storage, non-sporting events; costs: \nstaff, maintenance, utilities).762 Mr Thomas has derived his key inputs – the ticket revenues \nand the costs – from verifiable sources: ticket sales are derived from advertised ticket prices \n \n758  Mr Thomas was cross-examined over a number of pages of transcript on the false basis that he had not \nexplained how economic obsolescence should be assessed by reference to an DCF / income-based valuation: \nsee {Day20/92:15} - {Day20/97:23}. \n759  See IVS 2013 para C22 {D23/6/17}; IVS 2020 para 10.4-10.6 {D26/34/1}; RICS Red Book Global 2022 \n{K2-F/51/79}. \n760  See PwC Report at {D26/36/44} (para 3.6.4); EY ‘IFRS Real Estate Survey’ {D26/37/3}; and RICS VPGA \n4  para 1.3 {K2-F/51/103}. \n761  Mr Kaczmarek accepted this in XX {Day22/120:8-10}, apparently abandoning those parts of his written \nevidence which suggested it should be converted into a hospital, hotel or “ alternative real estate project ” \nKaczmarek3/¶¶198-199 {D24/1/62}. \n762  Kaczmarek XX {Day22/120:11} - {Day22/121:8}, {Day22/126:11-20}. \nAA2/15/470\n464 and publicly available data on match attendance, and operating costs are reported in a letter \nfrom SC Dnipro-1 – D1-2’s phoenix club and the tenant of the Stadium from c. 2017 \nonwards (see Thomas1/¶¶4.24-4.32, 4.64 {D18/1/40-43}, {D18/1/50}). \n954 There was no attempt in XX to suggest that Mr Thomas’ revenue figures in his DCF \nvaluation were underestimated such that his EBITDA was far too low.

Mr Kaczmarek \nsuggested two additional revenue streams763 – naming rights (for which there is no market \nin Ukraine764) and further non-football events (which have a de minimis  impact on the \nvaluation765). Finally, the tentative suggestion in XX that the Stadium could keep all ticket \nreceipts and earn rent from a football team is commercially improbable:766 clearly, if a club \nrents the Stadium for a match, the club will either pay rent and expect all of the gate receipts \nor enter into an agreement whereby ticket sales are shared with the Stadium owner. Either \nway, it will not significantly increase the revenue streams estimated by Mr Thomas. \n955 In those circumstances, the Court should accept that Mr Thomas’ EBITDA estimate is \nbroadly correct and that his DCF valuation is therefore reasonable. Not only is the income \napproach the right way to value an income-generating asset, but it is a necessary part of \nestimating the impairment / obsolescence adjustment in any cost approach valuation. Mr \nThomas’ valuation is the best guide to the market value of the Stadium in 2016. \n(d) Chernomorets cross-check \n956 The Chernomorets stadium is a 34,000 seater stadium built in 2011 and sold in 2020 by the \nDeposit Guarantee Fund of Ukraine for UAH 193m: {D18/6/148}. It is a stadium of \nsimilar size and age, being sold in similar circumstances (that is, without ownership of a \nresident football team). It was not a forced sale: the DGF made up to 20 attempts to sell the \nstadium before finally concluding a sale at a Dutch auction. Although Mr Kaczmarek \nreferred to it as a “ terrible cross-check ”, that appeared to be based on unsubstantiated press \nspeculation as to the motives of the purchaser {Day22/148:16} - {Day22/149:1}. It is \nimprobable to suppose that the Dnipro Stadium would have sold for c. eight times the value \nat which the Chernomorets stadium sold four years later. It is a “ general cross-check ”.767  \n \n763  Kaczmarek1/¶253 {D20/1/78}; Kaczmarek3/¶¶196-197 {D24/1/61-62}. \n764  Thomas2/¶¶8.4 - 8.6 {D23/1/27}. \n765  Even if Mr Thomas were to increase the number of non-football events to ten, that would only result in a 9% \nincrease in his valuation from UAH 125m to UAH 137m: Thomas2/¶8.10 {D23/1/29}. \n766  Kaczmarek XX {Day22/121:13} - {Day22/122:14}. \n767  Thomas1/¶¶4.68 - 4.69 {D18/1/52}, Thomas2/¶¶8.12-8.13 {D23/1/30}. \nAA2/15/471\n465 (3) The Training Centre \nAsset Credit \nValue Restated \n2016 Value Thomas \nvaluation Kaczmarek \nvaluation Difference \n(Bank / D1 \nvaluations) \nTraining \nCentre UAH 670m  UAH 142m UAH 105m  UAH 332m UAH 227m \nUSD equiv.  USD 27m USD 6m USD 4m USD 13m USD 9m \n957 The issues between the experts are similar to those in relation to the Stadium. \n(a) Willing buyer / willing seller \n958 D1’s case, as put to Mr Thomas, boiled down to the following: “...  if the seller says ‘I don’t care \nwho is in the market, I’m only prepared to sell at cost’, and FC Dnipro or another football owner needs a \nfootball training centre, then the reality is they will have to pay that cost if they want a football training \ncentre… ” {Day20/124:16-22}. That is not the relevant hypothetical transaction because ( i) it \nassumes the potential purchasers are individuals who own football clubs in Dnipro and ( ii) \nit assumes the seller is not a willing seller but the individual who constructed the Training \nCentre and/or one who is not prepared to sell for anything less than the construction cost. \n959 Indeed, it was also a false premise to suggest that a Dnipro football club would either have \nto purchase the Training Centre or pay the same amount to build a new training base.

A \nthird option would be for the football club to rent the Training Centre, which is exactly what \nSC Dnipro-1 have done since 2017 for UAH 4.8m p.a.: see {K2-E/30/161}. \n(b) The Veritas report \n960 Mr Kaczmarek relies on the Veritas report as a “ proper implementation of the Cost Approach ”.768 \nIn fact, Veritas’ methodology – starting at {K2-E/28/56} – was extraordinary: \n(1) Veritas calculated ‘original’ construction costs based on generic cost-per-square-metre \nfigures taken from government letters or (where the building was constructed in \n1969/71) from a USSR-era costs manual {K2-E/28/56}.769 The ‘original’ (entirely \nnotional) cost was then indexed up from 1969 to 1984 (column ‘K2’) and 1991 to \n2016 (column ‘K3’).770 There is no indication that where the ‘original’ cost was \ncalculated in rubles it was converted to hryvnia, and there is no justification for the \n \n768  Kaczmarek3/¶144 {D24/1/49}. \n769  Thomas2/¶4.28 {D23/1/17}. In the Veritas report, the costs manual is referred to as “aggregate replacement \ncost indicator”. \n770  As Mr Thomas explains, the index used by Veritas does not appear to include any adjustment for the years \nbetween 1984-1991 (see {K2-E/28/49} and Thomas XX {Day20/112:22} - {Day20/113:7}). The same issue \napplies to Veritas’ Stadium report: {K2-E/32/32}. \nAA2/15/472\n466 26% ‘developer profit’ which was then added to generate the notional replacement \ncost. \n(2) The notional replacement cost was then depreciated by reference to Marshall & Swift \ntables {K2-E/28/52}. In addition to the problems identified above, Mr Kaczmarek \naccepted that, inexplicably, certain assets were only subject to 30% depreciation even \nthough they were four years past their effective life {Day22/152:16} - \n{Day22/153:3}. \n(3) There was no adjustment for economic obsolescence or impairment (a point agreed \nbetween the experts771). Given the age and idiosyncratic nature of the Training Centre, \nit was fundamental to assess whether there was a demand for the use of such an asset. \nMr Kaczmarek’s assertion that it is to be inferred from the absence of any adjustment \nthat Veritas considered “ no adjustment was necessary ” reflected his partisan and self-\nserving refusal to accept reality: Veritas had simply failed to account at all for economic \nobsolescence: {Day22/153:15} - {Day22/154:21}. \n961 In the circumstances, the Court can have no confidence in the Veritas report. The cost \napproach is not (by itself) a reasonable approach to an income-generating asset772 and, in any \nevent, the Veritas report is not a proper or supportable implementation of the cost approach. \nIndeed, for the reasons set out above in relation to the Stadium, it is wrong to suggest that \nthe asset would only ever be sold or bought for its depreciated replacement cost. \n(c) Income approach \n962 Mr Thomas’s income approach treats the highest and best use of the Training Centre as a \nsports tourism complex with on-site accommodation.773 Mr Kaczmarek’s slight variation on \nthat is to propose a highest and best use as a “ membership-oriented sports club ” which would \n“generate a steady flow of membership fees on a monthly basis ”,774 while Mr Howard KC’s highest and \nbest use appears to be use as the training ground for a Dnipro-based football club. As to \nthose competing uses:  \n(1) Mr Thomas has conducted a reasonable DCF valuation assuming use for sports \ntourism. He calculates a median price per person per day and a normalised annual \noccupancy rate by reference to comparable properties (acknowledging that this \n \n771  Thomas-KaczmarekJR"}

His \npurported reason for doing so – that the Veritas report complies with IFRS 13 \n{Day22/158:14-21} – is undermined by the flaws in the Veritas report set out above. \nAs the Bank pointed out in XX, Mr Kaczmarek could have done some proper market \nresearch and produced a valuation based on notional income streams see \n{Day22/158:14} - {Day22/161:23}).

It follows that \nthe factual question for the Court is whether the staff occupying the auxiliary building paid \nrent by way of a distinct income stream, rather than as deductions to their wages, which was \nnot reflected in Mr Bezant’s valuation.785 They did not: \n(1) Mr Bezant’s DCF calculation captures all Hotel Zirka’s reported, historic revenue \nstreams.786 Hotel Zirka’s financial statements do not include a separate revenue line \nfor rental income from the staff building.787 If the staff paid rent which was (for \nunexplained reasons) not included in Hotel Zirka’s financial statements, D1-2 could \nhave disclosed the documents to show that was so. Indeed, D2 received regular \nreports on Hotel Zirka’s financial performance, occupancy rates, etc. from Novikov788 \nsuch that it is to be inferred he would have been able to obtain the relevant documents \nshowing an income stream from the auxiliary building if such documents existed.  \n \n780  Bezant-Assets1/¶¶7.27-7.30 {D19/1/133}; 7.31-7.60 (DCF analysis) {D19/1/133-145}; 7.61-7.68 (valuation \nmultiples) {D19/1/145-148}. \n781  Bezant-Assets1/¶¶7.27 ff {D19/1/133}. \n782  Kaczmarek1/¶214 {D20/1/67}. \n783  Mr Kaczmarek reaches this figure by taking the UAH 355m attributed to the auxiliary building by Veritas and \nreducing it by an arbitrary 30%: Kaczmarek1/¶216 {D20/1/67-68}. He ignores the fact that the UAH 355m \nfigure is generated by Veritas based on a price per square metre derived from existing hotels (see {K2-E/6/51}. \nBut the auxiliary block was not a hotel, and the use of these comparables to value the auxiliary building was \nplainly inappropriate. \n784  Kaczmarek1/¶216 {D20/1/67}. \n785  Mr Bezant accepted that it is a factual question: {Day20/6:18-23} \n786  Bezant-Assets2/¶10.16(1) {D26/1/149}; App. 8/¶A8.13 {D26/10/5}. \n787  Bezant-Assets2/App. 8/¶A8.14(1) {D26/10/6}. \n788  See 3.12.13 {E1/272.1}; 22.5.13 {E1/342.01}; 30.10.13 {E2/170.1}. These emails demonstrate that Mr \nBezant’s assumed occupancy rate of 42.4 - 51.5% (Bezant1/¶7.35 {D19/1/134}) was likely to be generous. \nAA2/15/475\n469 (2) Veritas is the only valuation report (out of seven) which records a separate value for \nthe auxiliary building.789 Even then, Veritas did not value the auxiliary building on the \nbasis of income from rent payments from staff.790 Furthermore, the author of the 2016 \nVeritas Hotel Zirka Report later authored a report by Asset Expertise, valuing Hotel \nZirka as at 31.12.16 (just six months after the Veritas valuation date of 30.6.16),  which \nattributed no additional value to the staff building on the basis that the two buildings \n“operate as a single, high-level hotel service facility ”.791 \n(3) The hotel and the auxiliary building form a single economic unit: the auxiliary building \nprovides indispensable services to the main hotel including offices, laundry, storage, \nand staff accommodation (see the description at {K2-E/6/21}). It is inherently \nunlikely that the auxiliary building generated a revenue stream which was not included \nin Hotel Zirka’s financial statements. \n(4) It is common for remote hotels to offer free accommodation to staff (as EY recorded \nat {E16/179/183}). \n(5) Hotel Mir \n966 Hotel Mir is a hotel and office complex with two main buildings.792 The Bank contends that \nit is not required to give credit for Hotel Mir because it has lost title to it in proceedings \nbrought by D1-2’s companies {AA2/1/241-242} (¶¶616-618).

That \nis absurd. \n976 Given that the Bank does not have title at all to the 138 hectares of scrubland, and the \nabsurdity of Kreston’s valuation of that land as a warehouse, the Court should not attribute \nany value to it. \n \n806  Bezant-Assets2/¶10.26 {D26/1/152}. \n807  {E16/179/201}; Kaczmarek1/¶196 {D20/1/62}; Bezant-Assets2/¶10.27 {D26/1/152}. \n808  Thomas1/¶¶5.1 – 5.54 {D18/1/53-66}. \n809  Kaczmarek1/¶¶275 {D20/1/84}, 277 {D20/1/85}, 289 {D20/1/88}. \n810  Thomas1/¶5.10 {D18/1/54}, {K2-E/25/10-11}. \n811  Thomas-KaczmarekJR/¶7.32 {D22/1/23}; Kaczmarek3/¶210 {D24/1/66}. \nAA2/15/479\n473 N6 THE AIRCRAFT  \nAsset Credit \nValue Razzhivina \nvaluation Seymour \nvaluation D1 revised \nvaluation812 Difference \n(Bank / D1 \nrevised \nvaluations) \n9 Aircraft US$163m US$69.3m US$84.8m US$86.8m US$17.5m \n(1) Introduction \n977 As explained in Section H above, the Bank’s primary position is that its loss is not reduced \nby reference to the value of the Aircraft but instead is reduced by repayments of principal \nactually made by Dilorsano (US$12.3m as at 16.6.23), the D1-2 company to which the Bank \nsold the Aircraft in August 2016. The true value of the Aircraft therefore only assumes \nsignificance if the Court does not accept the Bank’s primary position. \n978 The nine Aircraft transferred to the Bank by Perser had a Credit Value of US$163m. This \nvalue appears to have been based on 2016 reports by Veritas which the experts agree are \n“unreliable ” because they apply a methodology that is “ against accepted industry practice ”.813 \n979 The experts agree on the following methodology for valuing the Aircraft:814 \n(1) First, they adopt initial values that were published in August 2016  (the “Published \nValues” ).815 \n(2) Secondly, they identify a value for an aircraft of the same age as that being valued, \nassumed to be in ‘half-life’ condition, using their Published Values, but adjusted to \nreflect the actual specification of the Aircraft ( i.e. the “Half-Life Market Value” ). \n(3) Thirdly, they adjust the Half-Life Market Value to reflect the maintenance condition \nof the Aircraft (the “Maintenance Adjustment” ). \n \n812  D1’s valuation of the Aircraft has increased by c.

Further issues are identified at Razzhivina1/App. D {D13/6}. \n814  The experts were instructed to assess the ‘market value’ of the Aircraft and agree on the use of a comparative \nvaluation methodology (AicraftJR2/¶4.1{D15/2/8}). While they have been instructed to use different ‘market \nvalue’ standards and different valuation dates (Ms Razzhivina: 22.8.16; Mr Seymour: 16.8.16), they agree that \nthese matters do not result in any differences in their valuations (AicraftJR2/¶¶5.1-5.2{D15/2/11}). \n815  The Published Values were published on the OrielVIP online valuation platform by Ms Razzhivina; in IBA’s \n‘Aircraft Values Book’ by Mr Seymour – see AircraftJR2/¶6.4 {D15/2/12}. \n{AA2/15/206}\nAA2/15/480\n474 980 Of the nine Aircraft, there is agreement between the parties as to the value of four of them.816 \nThe remaining US$17.5m disagreement concerns two Airbuses and three Embraers, as \nfollows: \nAircraft Differences in the experts’ valuations817 \nHalf-Life Market \nValues Maintenance \nAdjustment Damage \nadjustment Total \ndifference \nAirbus  \n(MSN 2462) US$5.91m US$654,000 US$1.87m US$8.434m \nAdditional Airbus  \n(MSN 2682) US$5.45m US$124,000 – US$5.574m \nEmbraer  \n(MSN 145-250) US$990,000 US$290,000 – US$1.28m \nEmbraer 290  \n(MSN 145-290) US$990,000 (US$6,000) – US$984,000 \nEmbraer 394  \n(MSN 145-394) US$1.19m US$95,000 – US$1.285m \nTotal US$14.53m US$1.15m US$1.87m US$17.5m \n981 The principal dispute, accounting for US$11.36m of the net US$17.5m difference, relates to \nthe Half-Life Market Value of the Airbus and the Additional Airbus. The remainder relates \nto the Half-Life Market Value of the Embraer aircraft (US$3.17m), the experts’ Maintenance \nAdjustments (US$1.15m) and whether any adjustment is required to reflect damage \nsustained by the Airbus (US$1.87m).  \n982 The Bank submits that Ms Razzhivina is the more credible expert and her valuations are to \nbe preferred because: ( i) Mr Seymour’s valuations are littered with what he accepts are “ basic \nerrors”, (ii) Mr Seymour has been the subject of extensive and repeated judicial criticism, and \n(iii) Ms Razzhivina has provided more insight on the data points used in her calculations of \nher Half-Life Market Values (Mr Seymour, by contrast, has provided none). \n(a) Mr Seymour’s valuations contained “ basic errors ” \n983 On Day 18, Mr Seymour accepted that he had made several “ fairly basic ” errors in his first \nreport and that criticism of those errors was “ legitimate ” {Day18/104:11} - {Day18/105:2}. \n \n816  The Bank accepted Mr Seymour’s valuation of one Boeing following service of his first report, and D1 accepted \nMs Razzhivina’s valuations of the remaining three Boeings (all of which were higher than Mr Seymour’s values) \non Day 18: {Day18/6:1-6}.  \n817  Calculated as Mr Seymour’s values less Ms Razzhivina’s values. Parentheses indicate where Ms Razzhivina’s \nvalues are higher than Mr Seymour’s i.e. for the Maintenance Adjustment for the Embraer 290. \nAA2/15/481\n475 In total, Mr Seymour has had to amend five of his nine valuations. They are summarised \nbelow: \n(1) Failure to assume half-life condition where data unavailable: Where the condition of \nan aircraft component is unknown, the experts agree that it is “ accepted industry practice ” \nto assume the component is in half-life condition and apply no adjustment.818 In his \noriginal valuations, Mr Seymour failed to follow this practice for the two Airbuses. \n(2) Accounting for both the six- and 12-year checks: Airbus aircraft have major \nmaintenance checks every six and 12 years, with the latter being more extensiv"}

If an \naircraft has recently undergone a 12-year check it is standard appraisal practice to \nassume that this supersedes any requirement for a six-year check. Notwithstanding \nthis, Mr Seymour’s original valuations for the Airbuses wrongly adjusted for both \nchecks. This was corrected to comply with “ accepted industry practice ”.819 \n(3) Failure to value the correct engines: The experts agree it is accepted industry practice \nto value aircraft by reference to their title, rather than fitted, engines.820 In his original \nvaluations, Mr Seymour’s valued the fitted (rather than title) engines for one Boeing \nand two Embraer Aircraft. Indeed, he accidentally valued the same engine (ESN \n331216) in his valuations of two different Embraer Aircraft {Day18/101:1} - \n{Day18/102:6}.821 In the Joint Report, Mr Seymour agreed to correct his valuations \nto comply with “ accepted industry practice ”.822 \n(4) Using the incorrect information: On four occasions, Mr Seymour failed to use the \ncorrect information as to the subject Aircraft’s components or maintenance condition: \n(a) For two of the Embraers, Mr Seymour wrongly assumed the interval time \nrequired for the landing gear overhaul was 120 months rather than 144 months. \nMr Seymour corrected for these errors in the 2nd Joint Report.823  \n(b) For the Additional Airbus and Boeing 737, Mr Seymour assumed the wrong \nmaximum take-off weight (MTOW).824 Mr Seymour corrected this for the \n \n818  AircraftJR2/¶¶7.6 {D15/2/14}, 7.28 {D15/2/22}. \n819  AircraftJR2/¶¶7.5 {D15/2/14}, 7.26 {D15/2/21}. \n820  AircraftJR2/¶¶7.12 {D15/2/17}; 7.31 {D15/2/22}; 7.37 {D15/2/24}. \n821  See also Razzhivina2/¶¶145-146 and fn109 {D13/15/44}. \n822  AircraftJR2/¶¶7.13 {D15/2/17}, 7.32 {D15/2/23}, 7.38-39 {D15/2/24}. \n823  AircraftJR2/¶¶7.33 {D15/2/23}, 7.40 {D15/2/24}. \n824  For the Additional Airbus (MSN 2682) Mr Seymour assumed an MTOW of 89,000 kg when it was in fact \n93,000kg {D15/2/21}.

But the experts agree that they both rely on values initially published in August \n2016 ( viz. their Published Values), which prevents the use of hindsight {D15/2/12}.  \n(3) D1 appeared to suggest that Ms Razzhivina’s evidence was in some way lacking as it \nonly addressed ‘Market Value’ and not ‘Base Value’ {Day18/19:18} - \n{Day18/20:3}.829 This is a red herring: ( i) the experts agree that Base Value is a \n“theoretical concept ”, which Mr Seymour calls “ a proxy for… depreciation ”;830 (ii) it is Market \nValue that represents “ the most likely trading price that may be generated for an aircraft under \nthe market circumstances that are perceived to exist at the time in question ”;831 (iii) both experts \nwere instructed to assess Market Value not Base Value;832 and ( iv) it is Market Value \nwhich underlies both experts’ Published Values.833 \n988 By contrast, Mr Seymour’s approach is plainly unsatisfactory:  \n(1) He acknowledges that he opted not to provide “ any data points whatsoever ” \n{Day18/158:15-16} and instead relies on a “ single resultant figure ” published in his firm’s \nAircraft Values Book.834 That approach gives Ms Razzhivina – and the Court - nothing \nto go on.  \n(2) Mr Seymour accepted that he could have anonymised his data points (as Ms \nRazzhivina had done), which would have assisted the Court and protected his sources \n{Day18/121:17-25}.

Here, Mr Seymour questions Ms Razzhivina’s assumption \nthat ‘pre-delivery payments’ would have constituted 30% of the purchase price. \nBut Mr Seymour accepted in XX that ( i) pre-delivery payments were generally \naround “ 20% to 30% [of the purchase price ]” {Day18/146:19-21}; and ( ii) by \nassuming they were at the top end of this range ( i.e. 30%), Ms Razzhivina’s \nassumption results in a higher valuation which is therefore favourable to D1 \n{Day18/147:8-16}. \n992 Finally, it was put to Ms Razzhivina that ( i) her 11 data points supported Mr Seymour’s Half-\nLife Market Values; and ( ii) the trendline on which she plots Half-Life Market Values did \nnot in fact match up to her data points for Airbuses between 10-15 years old  {Day18/60:3} \n- {Day18/62:4}.841 Those are bad points: \n(1) The comparison undertaken was overly simplistic. As Ms Razzhivina explained:  \n“As I describe in my report, there is different value to different data points […] and \none has to consider all different influences of financing or possible existing lease[s]. \n[…] So you have to analyse data points in the hierarchy and some of them would be \nstronger data points, some of them would be less strong data points. So my analysis of \nthe data points could be different to that of IBA because I might be giving certain data \npoints more or less weight.”  {Day18/57:25} - {Day18/58:11} (see too {D13/5}) \n \n839  Seymour1/¶10.5 {D14/1/24}. \n840  Ms Razzhivina says that ECA guarantee financing is common, and “ provide [s] valuable transaction data points, often \nreported in the public domain and it is standard industry practice to rely on them where appropriate ” Razzhivina3/¶38 \n{D16/1/12}, {Day18/141:13} - {Day18/142:3} \n841  For Ms Razzhivina’s graph, see Chart I2 at {D13/11/11}. \nAA2/15/486\n480 (2) By contrast, D1’s comparison exercise ( i) ignored the fact that three of Ms \nRazzhivina’s data points represented sales with leases attached, which would increase \ntheir value;842 (ii) in two instances – data points 2 and 3 – used only the upper bound \nof Ms Razzhivina’s data points (US$52.4m and US$56.7m),843 ignoring the lower \nbounds (US$36.7m and US$39.05m); ( iii) on a separate occasion, proceeded on the \nbasis that Ms Razzhivina’s data point of US$43.75m for a 1 to 3 year-old aircraft was \nconsistent with Mr Seymour’s range of US$43.24m to US$50.17m for the same age \nbracket (in effect assuming that the aircraft was at the oldest end of that bracket);844 \n(iv) did not take into account any adjustments for differences in actual specifications \nbetween the aircraft in the data points and the ‘basic specification’ of Mr Seymour’s \nPublished Values; ( v) compared one data point for an Airbus sold new in 2015 with \nMr Seymour’s Published Value for an Airbus that was one-year old in 2015;845 and ( vi) \ncontained no consideration of how the data points interact with each other and their \nrelative weight. \n(3) Mr Seymour accepts that it is sensible valuation practice to obtain market values across \ndifferent vintages and plot them on a trendline.846 As for the datapoints for older \naircraft (10+years) which D1 suggested did not align with Ms Razzhivina’s values: \n(a) Two of the three that sit above Ms Razzhivina’s trendline – Airbus data points \n4 and 7 (in red) – reflect sales with leases to airlines with 5+ years remaining.847  \n(b) The third – Airbus data point 5 (in green) – was said by D1 to be “ totally \ninconsistent with [Ms Raz"}

That \nis not correct: ( i) the aircraft underlying Airbus data point 5 was between 10 and \n14 years old ( i.e. it may have been younger than 11 years)848 and ( ii) this is only \none data point of Ms Razzhivina’s 17 datapoints.  \n \n842  Airbus data point 4 {Day18/49:24} - {Day18/50:4}; Airbus data point 6 {Day18/45:3-6}; Airbus data point \n7 {Day18/54:24} - {Day18/55:1}. \n843  Airbus data point 2 (Razzhivina1/¶I20 {D13/11/6}, {Day18/42:11-19}); Airbus data point 4 \n(Razzhivina1/¶I27 {D13/11/7}, {Day18/43:2-7}).

That is wrong.850 On XX, Mr \nSeymour conceded that the stigma of such damage in this instance would lead to a reduction \nin value, albeit that he was only prepared to apply an unrealistically low 1-2% reduction ( cp. \nthe range of up to 30% in his report851): {Day18/165:15-21}. Ms Razzhivina applies a 10% \nreduction, which is plainly more sensible given the extent of the damage, and should be \npreferred. \n(iii) Maintenance Adjustments (US$654,000) \n995 The most significant area of disagreement relates to the negative maintenance adjustment \nfor the Airbus’s second engine (Ms Razzhivina: US$1.58m; Mr Seymour: US$701,000).852 \nMs Razzhivina pointed out errors in Mr Seymour’s calculations (he professed to rely on his \nfirm’s ‘Engine Value Book’ but does not use the assumptions set out therein) which, when \nfactored into the other maintenance adjustments, results in a total Maintenance Adjustment \n \n849  {K2-D/11/4-5} (¶2.2). \n850  Cp.

Further with respect to the Embraer in particular: \n \n853  Razzhivina3/Table 7 {D16/1/26}. \n854  Razzhivina3/¶87 {D16/1/27}. \n855  Ms Razzhivina also explained that the EVB relies on data for the higher performing “SelectOne” engines, \nwhereas the Airbus had the standard model: {D13/7/4}. \n856  AircraftJR2/¶7.27 {D15/2/21}. \nAA2/15/489\n483 (1) Mr Seymour’s Published Value in his firm’s AVB ranges from US$1.99m to \nUS$4.44m, which is said to be supported by “ feedback from traders ”. But those traders \nstate that “ the typical used trade prices  [of Embraer ERJ-145LR and ERJ-145EP aircraft ] \nranged between US$2,000,000 and US$3,330,000 ”.857 Mr Seymour does not explain how \nthe range increased from US$2m – US$3.3m to US$2m – US$4.44m, save to say that \nthe traders’ feedback “ would have been used in assessing the values incorporated into [his] \nAVB ”.858 \n(2) Mr Seymour’s valuation sits unhappily with his acceptance that there was a “ large \noversupply ” of Embraer ERJ-145s in August 2016.859 Indeed, Mr Seymour accepted that \noversupply of Embraers in 2016 sent prices “ plummeting ”.860 \n(3) It was put to Ms Razzhivina that her Embraer data points 1, 2 and 4 were more \nconsistent with Mr Seymour’s Half-Life Market Values than her own.861 As with the \nAirbuses, D1’s comparison was overly simplistic.862 \n999 As for the Maintenance Adjustment, Mr Seymour accepted Ms Razzhivina’s corrections to \nhis calculations: {Day18/173:4} - {Day18/176:5}.

US$1.6bn \nand c. UAH 8.8bn), as the Bank contends in the alternative; or ( iii) UAH ( c. UAH 17bn), as \nDs contend. A subsidiary question relates to the date of conversion of repayment by UAH-\ndenominated assets of USD-denominated drawdowns. Once these issues have been decided \nby the Court, the experts will be able to calculate the Bank’s loss: see Mr Thompson’s Loss \nMatrix at Thomspon4/App. 4-2 {D1/521P}. \n1003 Section O1 explains that the appropriate currency is a matter of Ukrainian law and not, as \nD1 contends, the lex fori . Section O2 sets out the Bank’s case that it will only receive full \ncompensation if it is awarded judgment in USD.

They mandate that the appropriate currency is \nthe one in which the claimant “ felt its loss ” and which would allow the claimant to be \ncompensated in accordance with the principle of restitution. They do not, as D1 appears to \nsuggest, provide any support for the proposition that a claimant can only feel a loss in its \n“presentational ” currency (the currency in which the Bank’s financial statements are presented, \ni.e. UAH) or “ functional ” currency  (the currency “ of the primary economic environment in which the \nentity operates ”, also UAH).869 \n1007 Instead, the appropriate currency is one which achieves restitutio in integro  to the claimant of \nthe misappropriated property.

In each case, it must be remembered than an award of damages is designed to achieve \nrestitutio in integrum  for the claimant, and this should include an award reflecting the currency \nin which the claimant has effectively felt or borne the loss. The ascertainment of the proper \nmoney of account should thus be regarded as part of the process which is designed to achieve \nthat end.

Although Mr Davidson maintained at the start of XX that the Bank’s loss \n“should be calculated in hryvnia across the board, including in respect of relevant drawdowns made in dollars ” \n{Day25/126:23} - {Day25/127:3}, he subsequently accepted that the effect of the fraud \nwas that the Bank had a “ massive net exposure to dollars ” and “ the only sensible way of calculating loss \non the dollar loans is in dollars ” {Day25/150:4-10}.  \n \n871  Mann and Proctor on the Law of Money (8th ed., 2022), ¶5.36 {M1/34/13-14}. \n872  See e.g. Uniks’ Relevant Loan 4Yu12462D {E4/191} and its bank statement for the period 28.7.14 – 31.12.14  \n{K7-B/18}). \nAA2/15/493\n487 1011 While that unequivocal yet unsurprising volte face is sufficient to dispose of the point in \nrelation to USD-denominated Relevant Drawdowns, we briefly address Ds’ and Mr \nDavidson’s discredited arguments below.873 \n(1) The Bank’s functional and presentational currency. (D1Def/¶83G {A1/8/49}, D1 \nOpening/¶¶313, 315-324 {AA3/1/106-110}). It now appears to be common ground \nthat the Bank’s presentational currency, referred to in D1’s Defence, is irrelevant (as \nD1’s counsel explained, “ some confusion in terminology may have crept in…presentation in this \ncase is something of a red herring ”…) {Day24/23:23} ff. But D1’s surviving point that the \nBank’s functional currency is UAH also goes nowhere. As a matter of principle, loss \ncan be suffered in a currency other than the primary currency in which an entity \nconducts its business. This simple misapprehension appeared to underpin D1’s \ncounsel’s XX of Mr Thompson on the topic: {Day24/17:22} - {Day24/25:5}.874  \n(2) The New Loans. Ds contend that the Relevant Drawdowns were ultimately repaid by \nthe UAH-denominated New Loans. This is irrelevant: ( i) the New Loans were further \nfraudulent lending intended to conceal the Misappropriation and they did not validly \nrepay the Relevant Loans; ( ii) the Bank’s loss occurred at the time of the Relevant \nDrawdowns, not later; and ( iii) in any case, the New Loans (including those which \nrepaid the Relevant Drawdowns) were impaired after nationalisation. As we have set \nout in Section H4(3) , the effect of the Transformation was to worsen the Bank’s \nposition by creating a mismatch between its USD-denominated assets and liabilities \n(albeit the position previously presented in the Bank’s financial statements was \nmisleading in that its USD-denominated assets, which included the worthless USD \nRelevant Loans, were vastly overstated). \n(3) The Bank’ “ accounted ” for transactions in UAH. Mr Davidson’s written evidence was \nthat the Bank’s “ assets and accounts are denominated entirely in UAH ”, making it “ striking ” \nthat it would seek to recover a USD loss: Davidson3/¶¶1.20, 2.41(1)-(2) {D2/20/12}. \nThis was a bad point as Mr Davidson accepted in XX:  \n(a) Mr Davidson accepted that the Bank’s USD assets are not “ denominated ” in \nUAH, and t"}

But this says nothing about \nthe nature or extent of the Bank’s loss resulting from the Relevant Drawdowns. \n{AA2/15/221}\nAA2/15/494\n488 sheet (in the latter case, including USD-denominated Eurobonds and \nsubordinated debt875) {Day25/130:1} - {Day25/131:3}. Indeed, Mr Davidson \naccepted that the Bank had “ very, very substantial dollar operations ” and “ a very \nsignificant proportion of its business was transacted in dollars ” {Day25/131:4-24}.876 \n(b) When faced with the hypothetical example of a theft of US$1m in cash (which \nwould also initially be recorded in UAH at the daily spot rate) followed by a \ndramatic depreciation of UAH, Mr Davidson agreed that – far from the amount \nin UAH being “ of relevance ” – “the Bank would claim in US dollars to ensure that it got \nback $1 million ” {Day25/134:16} - {Day25/138:2}. \n(c) Mr Davidson also accepted that, while USD-denominated loans were initially \nrecognised at the UAH-USD spot rate on the date of the transaction \n{Day25/139:21} - {Day25/140:4}, at the end of each financial year, the Bank \nwas required to convert the USD balance into UAH using the closing rate ( i.e. \nthe rate on 31 December) {Day25/140:20-24}. He recognised that his own \nanalysis failed to reflect this because it fixed the UAH value of USD Relevant \nDrawdowns as at the date of drawdown, while the UAH value in the Bank’s \nfinancial statements, adjusted at the end of each financial year, would have \nincreased year-on-year as the UAH depreciated: {Day25/141:3} - \n{Day25/142:21}.877 The effect of this, as Mr Davidson accepted, was that “ the \naccounting standards […] effectively maintain the value of the asset in its original \ncurrency…whereas, on [his] approach to calculating loss, [he] fix[es] the value of the loss on a \nparticular historic date and then it devalues in its original, its dollar currency ” \n{Day25/143:2-10}. He therefore had no choice but to accept that his written \nevidence that “[ t]he Bank’s approach is entirely contradictory to the way in which the Bank \naccounted for transactions ” {D2/20/29} (¶2.46) was “ misleading ” and that the Bank’s \napproach was in fact consistent with accounting standards {Day25/144:5-18}. \n(4) The Bank did not carry risk in USD. Mr Davidson’s written evidence was that the \nBank’s UAH loan book “ did not appear to increase ” year-on-year, which he said was \n \n875  See {K1/4/49-50} (Bank’s 2014 financial statements) and {K1/5/49-50}  (Bank’s 2015 financial statements). \n876  E.g. {K1/5/70}: in 2014: UAH 78bn of monetary financial assets in USD and UAH 131bn in UAH; in 2015: \nUAH 148bn in UAH and UAH 99.5bn in USD. \n877  See the example put to Mr Davidson at {Day25/141:7} ff: AEF’s Relevant Drawdown of US$11m on 27.12.13 \nwould have been recognised as at 31.12.13 at c.

This too was a bad point:  \n(a) Mr Davidson accepted that he simply looked at the aggregate value of the loan \nbook which is “ the product of multiple features, not just currency mix, repayment, and \ndrawdowns of other balances ” and that this was  “quite a broad brush approach to identifying \na prime facie starting point ” {Day25/145:7-16}. \n(b) He also accepted that Mr Thompson’s more rigorous analysis and the graphs at \nThompson4/App. 3-1 {D1/465/3-6} showed that in 2012-15, ( i) USD-\ndenominated monetary financial assets (including the loan book) nearly doubled \nin UAH terms while their value in USD decreased significantly, and ( ii) this \nsuggested that the Bank had significant USD exposure {Day25/146:4} - \n{Day25/147:21}. \n(c) As a result, Mr Davidson agreed that his argument about how the Bank carried \nrisk on its loan book was “ wrong ” and that the Bank’s corporate loan book was \nin fact increasing significantly as a result of exposure to currency \n{Day25/147:14-22}. \n1012 Finally, Mr Davidson agreed that the Bank’s open currency position was restricted under \nUkrainian law such that there was a “ very close match ” between USD-denominated assets and \nliabilities ( i.e. it had a balanced currency position with sufficient USD assets to match its \nUSD liabilities) {Day25/148:4-25}. He further accepted that ( i) if these financial assets were \nfraudulent and worthless, the Bank would not, in fact, have a balanced currency position \nand would have a “ massive net exposure to dollars ” and ( ii) as a result of depreciation, the Bank \nwould be required to spend much more UAH to purchase sufficient dollars to meet those \nliabilities {Day25/149:1} - {Day25/150:6}. The result of this was Mr Davidson’s belated \nacceptance that “ the only sensible way of calculating loss on the dollar loans is in dollars ” \n{Day25/150:4-10}. \n1013 Drawing the above points together, there was simply no credible basis for Mr Davidson ever \nto have put forward the evidence he did in Davidson3, which he has now completely \nabandoned. There is no evidence at all that the Bank funded the USD Relevant Drawdowns \nwith UAH and D1’s submission that this should be “ assumed ” and “ inferred ” (D1 \nOpening/¶¶316, 319 {AA3/1/109}) is clearly wrong (indeed, the evidence shows that the \nAA2/15/496\n490 Bank maintained significant USD reserves, funded through USD-denominated deposits, \nEurobonds and subordinated debt). \n(2) UAH-denominated Relevant Drawdowns \n1014 The Bank does not accept that it would receive full compensation for the UAH Relevant \nDrawdowns if it received damages in UAH. \n1015 First, as explained above, the Misappropriation was a coordinated scheme to extract USD \nfrom Ukraine involving the circumvention of currency control regulations which required \nreturn of foreign currency payments within 90 days. In particular:  \n(1) Between 1.11.13 and 13.2.14, all of the Relevant Drawdowns were denominated in \nUSD and transferred directly to Suppliers in that currency. It was not until 14.2.14 \nthat the first Relevant Drawdowns was denominated in UAH, and from 19.3.14, \nfollowing the Russian invasion of Crimea, they were primarily denominated in UAH \n(with a small number of USD-denominated Relevant Drawdowns, including Uniks’ \n{AA1/10/10-"}

In \nother words, UAH Relevant Drawdowns and their immediate conversion into USD \n \n878  Thompson4/¶3.76 {D1/461/26}; AccountancyJR2/¶5.3(2) {D4/2/13}. Between 7.2.14 and 1.5.14, the NBU \nimposed a requirement that the UAH amount be deposited in an account for five operational days before it \ncould be used to purchase USD: Reply/¶47.3 {A1/25/77}. \nAA2/15/497\n491 were used as a temporary substitute or proxy for USD Relevant Drawdowns.879 This \nunderlines the fact that this was a currency fraud directed at the extraction of USD \nfrom Ukraine which continued uninterrupted when it was no longer possible to extract \nUSD from the Bank using USD-denominated Relevant Loans. \n1016 Secondly, while the Borrowers’ primary obligation under UAH-denominated Relevant \nLoans was to return the UAH sum in that currency, those loan agreements also included a \n“loan commitment ” fee by which the Borrower undertook to return to the Bank an indexation \nfee to compensate for any move in the USD-UAH exchange rate ( e.g. {F2/38/1}, clause \nA.10): Reply/¶47.2 {A1/25/77}. As Mr Davidson accepted, the loan commitment fee was \nan embedded “ protection for the Bank that ensures that it gets back […] what would be an equivalent \namount in dollars ” {Day25/151:8-12} and the effect of the fee was to adjust what the \nBorrower had to repay from UAH to USD {Day25/152:20-23}. Mr Davidson accepted that \nthe fee “ represents the difference between the value of capital and interest payments in hryvnia and what \nwould have been paid if the loan had been denominated in dollars ” {Day25/151:1-7}. He further \naccepted that the need to hedge “ could be ” that the Bank wanted to hedge its foreign currency \nrisk associated with the UAH Relevant Drawdowns {Day25/153:14-22}, which risk would \narise if they were being funded by the Bank’s USD reserves. \n1017 D1’s response is that the Bank has not sought to recover that (contractual) loss and that it \ncannot rely on the terms of what it alleges are the void Relevant Loans: D1 Opening/¶314(1) \n{AA3/1/107}. But the indexation fees are relevant not because the Bank has claimed to \nrecover them but because they show that the purpose of the UAH Relevant Drawdowns \nwas ( i) that they would be converted into USD immediately as part of the currency fraud \nand ( ii) if the Borrower made any purported repayment to the Bank, it would be for the \nUSD-equivalent value of the UAH drawdown. \n(3) Repayment \n1018 A further currency-related issue is D1’s argument, again through Mr Davidson in Davidson3, \nthat credit for (valid) repayment should be calculated by reference to the exchange rate at \nthe date of the Relevant Drawdowns rather than the date of repayment. As to that: \n(1) The Bank’s position is that, where Transferred Assets were valued in UAH ( i.e. all of \nthe Transferred Assets other than the Aircraft), it will convert the true value of those \n \n879  The Bank accepts (and has pleaded: Reply/¶47.3 {A1/25/78}) that the process by which the UAH drawdowns \nwere converted to USD involved the Borrower selling the UAH funds back to the Bank, the Bank purchasing \nUSD on the Interbank Foreign Exchange Market of Ukraine (at the exchange rate applicable on the date of \nthe Releva"}

The Bank’s transaction data shows that, \nwhere a USD drawdown was repaid with a UAH-denominated asset, the value of the \nasset was converted from UAH to USD at the exchange rate on the date of repayment \nbefore being applied to reduce the outstanding balance. D1 has previously admitted \nthe same: D1 RRFI {A2/27/3}.880 \n(3) As set out above, the Bank contends that its loss resulting from UAH-denominated \ndrawdowns is also to be quantified in USD. Converting the value of UAH-\ndenominated assets at the 2013-14 exchange rate, rather than at the depreciated 2016 \nexchange rate, would prevent the Bank from being fully compensated for its loss \n(because the assets were, by 2016, worth c. three times less in USD terms).  \n1019 D1’s argument that the Bank’s approach gives rise to an “ artificial loss ” is premised on the \nappropriate currency of the Bank’s claim being solely UAH (which it is not, for the reasons \nset out above).881 Mr Thompson’s unchallenged evidence is that whatever approach is \nadopted in relation to the exchange rates applicable to repayments generate anomalies:882 if \n(as D1 argues) the value of a UAH-denominated asset is converted to USD as at the date of \nthe USD Relevant Drawdown it repays, the result is an apparent overpayment. Mr Davidson \naccepted that this was the case: in his analysis, the overpayment simply disappears into the \nether: see {Day25/155:21} - {Day25/158:5}.883  \n \n880  Footnote 2: “ Where the loan repaid was denominated in USD, a currency exchange occurred resulting in a debit of UAH … \nand a credit in USD … Account … which was then debited to repay the loan .” \n881  See Davidson3/¶¶3.84-3.102 {D2/20/52}. To take a simple example, if a UAH 100m drawdown is made in \n2013 and was converted by the Bank to US$12.5m in 2013 (at the prevailing rate of c. 8:1), when it is repaid by \na UAH 100m asset in 2016, that asset is converted (at the 2016 rate of c. 27:1) so it only repays US$3.7m of \nthe Bank’s USD-denominated loss. D1 says that this is artificial because, if the drawdown and repayment are \nall addressed in UAH, the asset should reduce the loss to nil. \n882  The only exception is where the loss is denominated in the currency of the original drawdown and direct \nrepayments (as opposed to ultimate sources of repayment) are treated as valid reductions of the Bank’s loss. \nSee Thompson4/App. 4-2 {D1/474P}. \n883  To take a simple example: a Borrower draws down US$10m on 1.9.14 (equivalent to UAH 131m) which is \nrepaid in 2016 with assets; at that point, in order to repay the US$10m loan, a total of UAH 248m is required. \nIf the Bank’s loss is calculated by converting the USD drawdown into UAH on the date of drawdown, it \ngenerates an apparent over repayment of UAH 117m (UAH 248m – UAH 131m). Thompson4/¶¶4.66-4.72 \n{D1/461/52}. The same mismatches arise even where the Relevant Drawdown and the ultimate source of \nrepayment are denominated in the same currency, if the Relevant Drawdown has been the subject of \nintermediary repayments in a different currency: see Thompson4/¶4.71 and fn. 131 {D1/461/5"}

The Transferred Assets were received in 2016 and that \nit is when the Bank’s loss was reduced by their then true value. \nO3 QUANTIFICATION OF THE BANK’S LOSS  \n1021 Mr Thompson’s Loss Matrix at {D1/521P} illustrates the different permutations of the \nBank’s claim in the event the Bank’s loss is denominated in USD, a combination of USD \nand UAH (by currency of drawdown: viz., USD 1,558,599,352 and UAH 8,803,056,367: \nReply/¶51 {A1/25/79}) or UAH only. \n• • • \nP INTEREST  \n1022 The Bank’s primary case is that it is entitled to pre-judgment compound interest ( i) as \ndamages under Ukrainian law; alternatively ( ii) pursuant to the Court’s equitable jurisdiction. \nIn the further alternative, the Bank claims pre-judgment simple interest ( i) as damages; \nalternatively ( ii) in Ukrainian law under Art. 625 CC; alternatively ( iii) under s. 35A of the \nSenior Courts Act ( “SCA” ) 1981. \n1023 The calculation of interest is likely to be complex and will depend upon ( i) the principal sum \nin damages awarded and the currency in which it is awarded; ( ii) the rate awarded;  (iii) the \ndate(s) from which interest should run; ( iv) (if interest is compounded) the appropriate rest \nperiods; and ( v) the date of judgment. These matters are addressed, as issues of principle, \nbelow: further calculations will be required before any judgment is entered that cannot \npresently be conducted given the uncertainties described above. \nP1 COMPOUND INTEREST  \n1024 As Foxton J has noted, “ compound interest reflects the commercial value of money – it is both the cost \npaid by those having to borrow it, and the return expected by those investing or saving it, whether they are \ntrading entities or not ”.884 It appears to be common ground885 that the Court has the power to \naward such interest in exercise of its equitable jurisdiction in light of a defendant’s fraud if \nsuch a power exists as a matter of Ukrainian law.886 The question for the Court is therefore \n \n884  Hotel Portfolio ll UK Ltd (In Liquidation) v Ruhan [2022] EWHC 1695 (Comm) at [42] {M1/29.02/14}. See \nalso Kuwait Oil Tanker v Al Bader (No 3) [2000] 2 All ER (Comm) 271 at [210], where Nourse LJ explained \ncompound interest as justified on a similar basis, viz. it ensures “ full compensation where the wrongdoer deprives a \nperson or company of monies employed in trading operations ” {M1/8/74}. \n885  See POC/¶63A {A1/2/35}; D1Def/¶83B {A1/8/48}; D2Def/¶70A {A1/18/33}; D3-8Def/¶68(3) \n{A1/20/34}. \n886  Kazakstan Kagazy plc v Zhunus [2018] EWHC 369 (Comm) at [96] {M1/19/40}, [108] {M1/19/44} ( per \nPicken J).  \nAA2/15/500\n494 whether, as a matter of Ukrainian law, the Bank can recover compound interest as damages \nfor its loss. Ds’ experts say that there is no power to award compound interest as damages;887 \nMr Beketov says that there is. \n1025 Mr Beketov’s view is to be preferred:  \n(1) While Mr Beketov acknowledges that there is no express power relating to compound \ninterest {Day28/64:19-22}, he considers that an award of compound interest as \ndamages would reflect the principle of full compensation and be analogous with the \ncompensatory nature of interest and inflation-linked losses payable under Art. 625 \nCC.888 This was not challenged in XX, where D1’s counsel simply asked Mr Beketov \nabout the need to plead and prove a loss {Day28/65:7} - {Day28/66:"}

The Bank \nhas pleaded its claim to compound interest (POC/¶63A {A1/2/35}; Reply/¶¶52, 54 \n{A1/25/80-82}) and relies on the matters set out below. \n(2) Mr Alyoshin accepted in his report that a claimant can claim loss of profits (including \ncompound interest) under Arts. 22 and 1166 CC provided it can prove those losses,889 \nbut adopted the opposite position in XX {Day32/17:21} - {Day32/18:5}. Assuming \nthe former proposition represents his actual view, he failed to explain during XX why \na claimant cannot claim a loss represented by (i) lost opportunity to profit by lending \nmoney at a compound rate or (ii) additional borrowing at compound rates \n{Day32/17:21} - {Day32/18:13}.  \n(3) Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida’s view that there is no entitlement to compound \ninterest as damages and no ability to award pre-judgment simple interest (see below) \nwould suggest a strikingly unjust lacuna in Ukrainian law which is inconsistent with \nthe full compensation principle (and with English public policy). In the absence of any \nprovision of Ukrainian law prohibiting compound interest, the better view is that it \nmay be awarded to provide full compensation. \n1026 If compound interest may be awarded in Ukrainian law, the Bank must show that it has \nsuffered such a loss as a result of Ds’ conduct. To do so, it may rely on the circumstances \nof the case including the undisputed and obvious facts as to the nature of its business.890 The \n \n887  Alyoshin1/¶310 {C2/1/114}; Alyoshin2/¶¶256, 322-329 {C7/1/104-106};  Nahnybida3/¶¶272-273 \n{C4/1/52}; Nahnybida4/¶147 {C9/1/32}.  \n888  Beketov9/¶434 {C6/1/164}. \n889  Alyoshin2/¶¶324-329 {C7/1/104-106}. \n890  As a matter of English law, “ the question of what evidence is required from which a court can infer that a plaintiff has suffered \na financial loss in the form of the incurring of borrowing costs will depend on the circumstances of the particular case ”: Sagicor \nBank Jamaica v YP Seaton [2022] UKPC 48 at [33] {M1/25/17}. \nAA2/15/501\n495 Bank’s position is that, as a result of the Misappropriation, it was required to finance c. \nUS$1.9bn (or its UAH equivalent) on compound interest terms to plug the hole in its balance \nsheet. Like any retail bank, the Bank’s core business involved using funds from depositors \nand others to lend to customers (mainly D1-2 companies). Substantially all of the Bank’s \nfinancing was undertaken on a compound interest basis because it required the Bank to pay \nmonthly interest to the depositor/lender. In particular:  \n(1) The Bank’s main source of financing in the period 2013 onwards was customer \ndeposits denominated in UAH and USD, in respect of which the Bank paid interest \non a monthly (and necessarily compound) basis;891 and  \n(2) The Bank’s other primary source of funding was lending from the NBU. Around the \nperiod in which the UAH Relevant Drawdowns were made totalling UAH 8.8bn \n(February/March 2014 to 1.9.14), the Bank entered into loan facilities with the NBU \nwith a face value of UAH 10bn {E3/172.1} {E3/172.2}. And between 31.12.13 and \n31.12.15, its total borrowing from the NBU increased from UAH 3.4bn (31.12.13) \n{K1/4/5} to UAH 18.3bn (31.12.14) ( ibid.) to UAH 27bn (31.12.15) {K1/5/5}. All \nof the NBU loans provided for interest to be paid monthly (and necessarily on a \ncompound basis) until maturity (see e.g. clause 2.5 at {E3/172.1/2}).  \n1027 The Bank claims compound interest as damages in Ukrainian law (or under the English \ncourt’s equitable jurisdiction8"}

All \nof the NBU loans provided for interest to be paid monthly (and necessarily on a \ncompound basis) until maturity (see e.g. clause 2.5 at {E3/172.1/2}).  \n1027 The Bank claims compound interest as damages in Ukrainian law (or under the English \ncourt’s equitable jurisdiction892) whether its damages are awarded in USD or UAH as follows: \n1028 Dates: the Bank’s loss was suffered on the date of each Relevant Drawdown and the Bank’s \ninterest loss likewise runs from each of those drawdowns, less genuine recoveries received \n(in relation to which interest loss would accrue for the period between the date of harm and \ndate of genuine recovery). \n1029 Rates: the Bank’s primary case is that the appropriate rate is 10.875%, being the rate at which \nthe Bank borrowed USD under loan participation notes issued in 2013 (POC/¶64(a) \n{A1/2/35}, {E1/255/3}). Alternatively, the rate should be the rate payable by the Bank on \nits most expensive USD or UAH borrowing, the rate payable on the NBU loans, or its \nweighted average cost of USD and/or UAH borrowing: Reply/¶¶52-54 {A1/25/79}. The \ncalculations for the Bank’s most expensive and weighted average cost of borrowing in USD \n \n891  See customer account terms at {E1/172.3}, {E1/239.2.2}, {E3/26.1}, {E4/324.1}, {E11/129.1}, \n{E12/21.1}, {E12/224.1} and {E17/150.3}.  \n892  The approach to awarding compound interest under English law is largely the same as under Ukrainian law, \nviz, “fairly to compensate the recipient of interest for being deprived of money which he should have had …”: Fiona Trust \nHolding v Privalov [2011] EWHC 664 (Comm) at [13] {M1/15/6}.  \nAA2/15/502\n496 and UAH are summarised in Reply/Annex H {A1/33}. Where those rates fell below 3% \np.a., the Bank’s claim is for interest at 3% p.a. as a presumed rate of return which the Bank \nwould have made on the misappropriated funds: Reply/¶52.2.4 {A1/25/80}. \n1030 Rests: substantially all of the Bank’s borrowing required the Bank to pay interest on a \nmonthly basis. The Bank therefore claims compound interest with monthly rests. \nP2 SIMPLE INTEREST  \n1031 Simple interest as damages. If the Court finds that the Bank did not suffer a compound \ninterest loss, the Bank contends in the alternative that it suffered a simple interest loss (in \nUSD and/or UAH) from the dates and at the rates outlined above: Reply/¶¶53-55 \n{A1/25/81-82}. \n1032 Art. 625 CC: inflation and interest. The experts agree that, as a matter of Ukrainian law, a \nclaimant is entitled to simple interest at 3% p.a. and that, if the loss is denominated in UAH, \nthe principal amount of the debt will be adjusted upward for inflation: UkrJR/¶111 \n{C5/1/43}.893 The main issue between the experts is whether an award made pursuant to \nArt. 625 for interest and inflation losses runs from the date of infliction of harm / \nenrichment (Mr Beketov894) or the date of judgment (Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida895):  \n(1) In his first report, Mr Beketov acknowledged a tension in the Ukrainian case law896 \nbut explained that his view was consistent with Supreme Court authority (see \nBeketov9/¶¶411-416 {C6/1/157}), the compensatory nature of interest pursuant to \nArt. 625 CC, and the principle of full compensation.897 \n(2) On 2.8.23, the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court clarified the position in \nIntermet.898 Referring to, and summarising, its earlier decision in Person 1 v Head \n \n893  Mr Beketov has explained how an award for inflation loss is calculated at Beketov11/¶¶251-264 {C9.2/1/94}. \n894  Beketov8/¶330 {C1/1/109}; UkrJR/¶112.1 {C5/1/44}. \n895  UkrJR/¶112.2 {C5/1/44}; Alyoshin1/¶¶307-308 {C2/1/112-113}; Nahnybida3/¶¶261, 265-271 {C4/1/48-\n52}.

See also Nahnybida3/¶¶282 {C4/1/54}. \n896  Beketov9/¶431 {C6/1/164}.Mr Beketov noted that Mr Nahnybida’s reliance on the decision of the Supreme \nCourtdated 27.5.20 in Case No. 916/1961/19 at Nahnybida3/¶270 is misplaced, because it related to \ndisgorgement of the defendant’s profits pursuant to Art. 1214(1) CC rather than return of funds which had \nbeen acquired without sufficient legal grounds pursuant to Art. 1212 CC: Beketov9/¶¶425-429 {C6/1/162-\n163}. Mr Beketov also notes that a third approach was adopted by the Supreme Court in its Resolution of \n23.4.19 (Nº 918/47/18) where interest accrued from the date falling 7 days after the claimant’s demand for \npayment: Beketov9/¶430 {C6/1/164}. \n897  See the example given at Beketov9/¶¶423-424 {C6/1/162}, which is consistent with the decision of the \nSupreme Court dated 17.10.18 in Case No. 908/2552/18. \n898  Intermet, decision of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court dated 2.8.23 in Case No. 904/6760/21 \n{C9.12/4/4}. \nAA2/15/503\n497 Office of the Pension Fund of Ukraine in the Cherkasy Region899 (which Mr Beketov \nhad cited in support of his view at Beketov9/¶¶412-413 {C6/1/158}), the Grand \nChamber concluded at [42] – [43] {C9.12/4/8}: \n“42. […] In view of the above, it can be concluded that upon entry into force of a court \ndecision on compensation for damage, the debtor is obliged to pay a precisely defined \namount of damage, but the obligation itself arose between the parties from the infliction of damage . \nThe Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court considers erroneous the conclusions of the \ncourts that the parties have monetary obligations based on the court decision. \nThe obligation is not one that arose from a court decision. This is an obligation to compensate for \ndamage, in which the court decision determines the specific amount of damage and states that there is \nan obligation between the parties. \nSince compensation for damages is also possible in monetary form, in this case a monetary obligation \narose between the parties, as one party is obliged to pay a certain specified amount of money to the \nclaimant. \n43. In other words, the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court has already expressed \nits legal position that the monetary obligation to compensate for damage arises between \nthe parties from the infliction of damage, and not from a court decision. The provisions of part \n2 of Article 625 of the Civil Code of Ukraine should be applied taking into account the \nabove opinion of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court.” (italics in original, \nunderlining added) \n(3) D1’s counsel attempted to characterise Intermet and Person 1 v Head Office of the \nPension Fund of Ukraine in the Cherkasy Region as “ simply clarifying that an obligation in \ntort arose when the tort was committed ” {Day28/70:10-12}900 and “ the monetary obligation arises \nbetween the parties from the infliction of damage ” {Day28/75:19-22}, putting to Mr Beketov \nthat the obligation under Art. 625 only arose “ from the point at which the extent of a monetary \nobligation is known ” {Day28/80:20-25}. But ( i) it is clear from the passage quoted above \nthat the Grand Chamber was dealing squarely with Art. 625; ( ii) D1’s counsel’s issue \nwith Mr Beketov’s position (“ a defendant could be liable or treated as liable for default on an \nobligation even though, until judgment, no one knows what the extent of the judgment actually is ”) is \nan illusory one (the claimant can claim an amount and the Court can adjust it as \nnecessary);  and ( iii) Mr Beketov’s evidence was clear: “ my opinion on this whole case is that \nthe Grand Chamber of the Su"}

As Mr Beketov explained in Beketov9/¶413 \n{C6/1/158}: “ But, because the claimant had not asked to recover interest from any other date, such as when the moral damage \nwas suffered, the Grand Chamber did not change the lower courts’ award ”. \nAA2/15/504\n498 the interest must accrue from the moment of damage, not from the court decision ” {Day28/76:14} \n- {Day28/77:4}.901 \n(4) As for Mr Alyoshin, and despite having been shown the passage above, he maintained \nthat Art. 625 is to be applied from the date of judgment {Day32/16:5-11}. \n(5) Mr Beketov’s interpretation of Intermet is clearly the right one. Whilst Mr Beketov \nwas asked about a referral to the Grand Chamber in relation to unjust enrichment \nclaims in which the panel referring the issue expressed a contrary view {Day29/84:19} \n- {Day29/90:7},902 that referral predated Intermet, the Grand Chamber has yet to hear \nthe case,903 and Mr Nahnybida later accepted that any interpretation of the Grand \nChamber in relation to Art. 625 would be “ applied both to the tort and unjust enrichment \nclaims ” {Day33/56:7-14}.  \n1033 The Bank therefore seeks interest and (in relation to any loss denominated in UAH) inflation \nlosses from the date of each Relevant Drawdown. Importantly, as Mr Beketov shows, any \njudgment given in UAH should be indexed to UAH inflation from the date harm was caused \nto the date of judgment,904 plus 3% interest.  \n1034 Section 35A SCA 1981. The “ practical significance of [the availability of pre-judgment interest under the \nlex causae ] … is much reduced ” 905 due to the discretion conferred upon the English Court \npursuant to s. 35A SCA906 to award pre-judgment simple interest. This is a matter of \nprocedure and therefore of the lex fori ;907 the availability of interest in the lex causae  may \ninform – but is not determinative of – the Court’s exercise of its discretion.908 If simple \ninterest is awarded under s. 35A, the Bank claims interest from the date of each Relevant \n \n901  Mr Beketov was also cross-examined on two further decisions which adopted a different approach. As for the \nfirst, a decision of the Supreme Court dated 16.6.21 in Case No. 910/14341/18 {C9.9/4}, ( i) he had already \ndrawn the Court’s attention to this authority which was inconsistent with his view in Beketov9/¶417 \n{C6/1/159}; and ( ii) he explained at {Day28/72:20-25} that this previous tension in the authorities had been \nresolved by the Grand Chamber’s decision in Intermet. The second was a decision of the Commercial Court \nof the Donetsk Region dated 25.9.23 {C9.13/7} and, as Mr Beketov explained at {Day28/79:8} - \n{Day28/80:17}, this was a first-instance decision, not yet in force because it is susceptible to being appealed \nand that was inconsistent with the Grand Chamber’s decision in Intermet. \n902   Ukrtransgaz, decision of the Supreme Court dated 29.5.23 in Case No. 910/3831/22 {C9.12/2/8}. \n903   Mr  Beketov  explained  that  the  Grand  Chamber  was  due  to  hear  that  case  around  the  time  of  his  XX \n{Day29/85:18}.
