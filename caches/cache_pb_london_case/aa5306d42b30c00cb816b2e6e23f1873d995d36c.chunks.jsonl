I am a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered \nAccountants in England and Wales and a Senior Managing Director in the \nLondon office of FTI Consulting, a global expert services firm specialising, \ninter alia , in litigation support and f inancial investigations.  I have extensive \nexperience of financial investigations and forensic accounting engagements. \nI attach a copy of my qualifications and relevant experience at  Appendix  1-1 \nto this report.  \n1.2 I have been instructed by Hogan Lovells Inter national LLP , the English \nsolicitors retained in these proceedings by the Bank, to provide independent \nexpert evidence in these proceedings in the field of forensic accountancy.  \nMy instructions  \n1.3 I am instructed by Hogan Lovells to address the following ( my letter of \ninstruction is attached  at Appendix 1-2): \na)the accuracy and completeness of the Bank’s causation analysis ( to\nwhich I refer  hereafter  as the Bank’s case);\nb)the accuracy  and completeness of  the First Defendant ’s “Tracing\nExercise” ;\nc)a comparison of the Bank’s case and the First Defendant’s “Tracing\nExercise” ;\nd)the First Defendant’s case on repayment;\ne)the loss alleged to have been suffered by the Bank ; and\nf)whether the Bank’s transactional data supports the Defendant\nSuppliers’ case .\n1.4 My report is arranged in nine  sections, as follows:  \na)Introduction;\nb)Executive Summary;\nc)The Bank’s case ;\nD1/1/20\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 21 d) The First Defendant’s case on repayment ; \ne) The First Defendant’s “Tracing Exercise ”; \nf) Comparison of the Bank ’s and the First Defendant’s cas es; \ng) The loss suffered by the Bank;  \nh) The Defendant  Supplier s’ case ; and \ni) Expert’s Declaration.  \nSources of information  \n1.5 In Appendix 1-3 I set out the documentation which has been provided to me \nand on which I have relied in the preparation of this report.  \nAssis tance from FTI Consulting employees  \n1.6 I have prepared this report assisted by FTI Consulting employees working \nunder my direction and review.

(See further at paragraphs  \n3.18  to 3.22 , and 3.164 ). \nb) apart from overlooking 30 de minimis  Additional Relevant \nDrawdowns  (which amount to approximately USD 1.4 6 million  and \ndo not affect my analysis ), I consider that the Bank’s case on how the \nRelevant Drawdowns funded the Unreturned Prepayments  is \ncomplete . (See  furthe r at paragraphs  3.175  to 3.183 ); \nc) I agree with the First Defendant’s analysis of the direct  source of \npurported repayment of Relevant Loans  and Intermediary Loans  to a \nvery large extent . However, he does not consider how the Relevant \nDrawdowns were ultimately  (i.e. indirectly) repaid . (See further at \nparagraphs  4.1 to 4.62 ); \n \n4  When discussing the Bank’s case in this report, and in accordance with financial \nterminology , I use the word “funded” rather than “caused” to describe the Bank’s \ncase on how the Rele vant Drawdowns can be traced to the Unreturned \nPrepayments (and how the Relevant Drawdowns were purportedly repaid). In \ndoing so, I am referring to linking transactions ( i.e. Prepayments and Returns of \nPrepayment) by Supply Agreement references in the Bank ’s transactional data, as \nwell as following fund flows where there are no narrative descriptions to link. \nAccordingly, when using this terminology, I am not necessarily referring to the \navailable monies in the entity’s account at the time of the transactio n. \nD1/1/23\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 24 d) under the Bank’s Methodology ,5 at least  94% of the Relevant \nDrawdowns were  ultimately repaid by the Transformation  (45%) , by \nAsset Transfer  (33%)  or by Relevant Drawdow ns themselves  (16%) , \nand not with cash from external sources . (See further at paragraphs  \n4.63  to 4.75 ); \ne) the First Defendant’s “Tracing Exercise” does not appear to follow a \nconsistent or coherent methodology .

(See further at paragraphs  \n4.63  to 4.75 ); \ne) the First Defendant’s “Tracing Exercise” does not appear to follow a \nconsistent or coherent methodology . Indeed, owing to its \ninconsistencies, I consider it would not be possible to reproduc e his \n“Tracing Exercise” in the absence of the Lafferty Spreadsheets . For \nexample :  \ni. what is presented as the “next” payment in a particular  \nPayment Chain appears to have been  selected in several \ndifferent ways  without explanation . (See further at \nparagraphs 5.39  to 5.48 ); \nii. it is unclear on what basis Payment Chains are said to contain \n(or not contain) a “gap in the chain [of payments] ”6 (which is \nreferred to as a Break Point ), nor why a particular point  in th e \nPayment Chain has been identified as a  Break Point with  \nassociated Compensation Payment(s) . Further, ignoring the \nBreak Point result s in a different outcome  from that \ncontended in the Lafferty Spreadsheets . (See further at \nparagraphs 5.49  to 5.55  and 5.121  to 5.134 ); and \niii. I cannot always determine what  approach the Firs t \nDefendant has taken . (See further at paragraphs 5.57  to \n5.61 ). \nf) the First Defendant’s “Tracing Exercise” also  contains significant  \ninaccuracies and inconsistencies , even if the Bank’s transactional \ndata is analysed in the way the First Defendant purports  to analys e \nit. Therefore, I do not consider it is accurate. For example : \n \n5  As explained at paragraph 4.68 , we also analysed the ultimate sources of \nrepayment of Relevant Drawdowns using an Alternative Methodology. The findings \nwere la rgely the same in each case (i.e. only 0.1% of the Relevant Drawdowns were \npurportedly repaid with cash from external sources).  \n6  Lafferty 2, paragraph 70.  \nD1/1/24\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 25 i. drawdowns were incorrec tly traced to a loan repayment. \nThey either repaid another loan, were paid into another \naccount of the same borrower, or were paid to an  Other \nNamed Customer . (See further at paragraphs 5.66  to 5.83 ); \nii. entities in almost all th e Payment Chains  which contain  a \nBreak Point  (i.e. 39 of 43  Payment Chains ) were either under - \nor over -“compensated”. (See further at paragraphs 5.97  to \n5.99 ); and \niii. Compensation Payments were made as many as 62 days after \nthe Break Point  to which they are said to relate . It is \nparticularly  unclea r how these payments can be considered \npart of the same Payment Chain. (See further at paragraph \n5.100 ). \ng) I do not consider that the Payment Chains serve any commercial \npurpose. To the contrary, the majority contain one or more features \nwhich the Financial Action Task Force identifies as indicat ors of \nTrade -Based Money Laundering.  (See further at paragraphs 5.135  to \n5.165 ); \nh) the First Defendant’s “Tracing Exercise” also contains significant \nomissions , even if the Bank’s transactional data is analysed in the \nway the First Defendant purports to analyse it . Therefore, I do not \nconsider it is complete. For example:  \ni. the Payment Chain is incomplete (e.g. it is missing a \nrepayment which, on the First Defendant’s case, would be \nthe final step). (See further at paragraphs 5.171  to 5.188 ); \nii. the Lafferty Spreadsheets do not explain that certain loans \nrepaid were not issued by th e Bank . (See further at \nparagraphs 5.189  to 5.193 ); and  \niii. the “tracing” purportedly depicted is unclear , such that  \nadditional information would be required to verify that the \nfunds repaid the loan identified . (See further at paragraphs \n5.201  to 5.228 ). \nD1/1/25\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 26 i"}

The Net Credit V alue s of those assets in the \nBank’s transa ctional data  are relied on by the First Defendant  but are \ndisputed by the Bank. The Bank’s case is that it s loss should be \nreduced7 by reference  to th e portion of the “true ” value of the assets  \nwhich w ere ultimately applied in purported repayment of  the \nRelevant Drawdowns ;8 \nj) assuming that the amount for which the Bank ’s loss  should be \nreduced  on account of the Asset Transfer was USD  129,514,026 ,9 the \nBank suffered a loss of USD 1,776,579, 061 (excluding interest) . I can \nprovide calculation s based on other assumed asset  values  if the court \nso wishes . (See further at paragraphs  7.1 to 7.15 ).  \n \n7  I am instructed that any such reduction is predicated on the Bank having good title \nto these ass ets and/or having sold them at auction. Accordingly, I have been \ninstructed to exclude the assets referred to in paragraph 28 M of the RAR. To the \nextent that the Bank’s title to any other Transferred Assets is successfully \nchallenged, I understand that the  Bank’s loss should not be reduced in respect  of \nthese assets .  \n8  RAR, paragraph 28L.  \n9  This excludes the assets referred to at paragraph 28M of the RAR. This figure uses \nthe “true” values of the Transferred Assets as set out in Appendix 7 -2 which, save \nfor the three assets I address at paragraph 7.11 , are based on figures in the expert \nreports of Mr. Bezant (on the Transferred Assets ), Ms.  Razzhivina and Mr. Thomas . \nThese reports have been provided to me in final but unsigned form for the purposes \nof this report.  \nD1/1/26\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 27 3 The Bank’s case  \nWhat is the Bank’s case ? \nOverview  \n3.1 The Bank alleges that the First and Second Defendant s orchestrated the \nmisappropriat ion of  USD  1,911,877,385  between April 2013 and September \n2014, while the Bank was under their ownership and control .10 It is alleged \nthat the misappropriation was undertake n using companies the First and \nSecond Defendant s controlled, including the Third to Eighth Defendants.11 \n3.2 In simplified form , the essential elements of the Bank’s case are as follows \n(as illustrated in Figure 3-1 below , supported by a Key in Appendix 3-1-1): \na) 50 companies12 owned and/or controlled by the First and Second \nDefendants (the Borrowers ) entered into sham revolving credit \nfacilities13, 14 with the Bank ( the Relevant Loans ), pursuant to which \nthe Bank  paid the Borrowers USD 2. 33 billion  (the \nRelevant  Drawdowns );15 \n \n10  RRAPOC, paragraph 5.  \n11  RRAPOC, paragraphs 6 -12. \n12  47 of which were  customers of the Bank’s  Ukraine  head office, and  three of which \nwere  customers of the Bank’s  Cyprus  Branch.  \n13 RRAPOC, paragraph 52(2).  \n14  Hereafter referred to as loans (including Relevant Loans, Intermediary Loans and \nother loans).  \n15  Annex B to the Bank’s RRFI  sets out USD - and UAH -denominated  Relevant \nDrawdowns , totallin g approximately  USD 2.3 3 billion .

The Prepayments were \nmade under sham  Supply Agreements , purportedly for the supply of \nvarious goods ; 16 \nc) certain of the Prepayments were returned to  the 46 Borrowers \napproximately 90 days later in purported compliance  with currency \ncontrol regulations  (Returns of Prepayments ), but were followed by \na further Prepayment to a Defendant Supplier;  \nd) of the USD 2.33 billion  of Relevant Drawdowns, U SD 1.91 billion was \nprepaid by the 46 Borrowers to the Defendant Suppliers  under the \nRelevant Supply Agreements ; however, no goods were delivered , \nand the Prepayments were not returned to the Borrowers ;  \ne) Returns of Prepayments are identified where the Bank ’s \ntransactional data records a repayment (from a Suppli er to a \nBorrow er) made with reference to the same Supply Agreement as \nthe preceding Prepayment  (from the same Borrower to the same \nSupplier) .17 However, where a Prepayment  is made pursuant  to a \nRelevant  Supply Agreement  but there is no repayment referring to \nthe same Relevant  Supply Agreement , that is an Unreturned \nPrepayment ; and \nf) at least USD 1.91 billion of the Relevant Drawdowns has not been \nvalidly repaid .\n \n16  RRAPOC, paragraph 12.  \n17  There are some minor discrepancies between references in the Bank’s transactional \ndata which appear to refer to the same Supply Agreement. For example, a ‘dash’ \nwhich is present in the Prepayment reference  may be omitted in the Return of \nPrepayment reference; additional spaces may be added \n(e.g.  “0605A -2 DD 06.05.2014 ”, compared with “ 0605A -2 DD06.05.2014 ”); dates \nmay be preceded by “ DD”, “OT” or “ dated ”; and date format may vary (e.g. \n30.07.2014 , compared with  30.07.14). However, notwithstanding these \ndiscrepancies, they clearly  refer to the same Supply Agreement.  \nD1/1/28\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 29 Figure 3-1: Overview of the Bank’s case\n \nNote: There are 12 instances where a Relevant Drawdown directly  funded (either in full or in part) an Unreturned Prepayment under a Relevant \nSupply Agreement.

The reason \nwhy the Prepayment was returned  90-days later appears to relate to \ncurrency control ;20 \n \n18  129 Prepayments were made, each using an individual Supply Agreement \nreference. Of these Prepayments, 75 were fully returned. (See Appendix 3 -1-2, \ncolum ns F and H).  Those that were not returned in full were Unreturned \nPrepayments.  \n19  As noted in Figure 3 -1, there are 12 instances in which a Relevant Drawdown \ndirectly  funded (in full or in part) an Unreturned Prepayment under a Relevant \nSupply Agreement ( i.e. in Step  2). In these instances, the First Defendant appears \nto agree with this element of the Bank’s analysis. (See Appendix 3 -1-2, column G). \nIn these instances, there are no steps after Step  2. \n20  Mr Beketov’s eighth expert report dated 23 November 2021 , paragraph 365.  \nD1/1/30\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 31 Step 4a:  following  the Return of Prepayment and prior to  the \nsubsequent Prepayment , in most instances some or all of the \nfunds were converted from USD to UAH and back to USD,21, \n22, as explained in paragraphs 3.11  to 3.12 . Some  funds were \n“lost” in this process, as explained in paragraph  3.13 . \nHowever, the additional Relevant Drawdown made in Step 3 , \nto which I refer  as an FX Top -up, compensated for this “loss”;  \ne) Step 5:  in certain instances,23 part of the Return of Prepayment  \nrepaid a Borrower’s loan.24 This created a shortfall in the funds \navailable to make the subsequent Prepayment. The additional \nRelevant Drawdown in Step 3 made up the difference;  \nf) Step 6:  this is the same as Step 2 (i.e. a Prepayment was made from  \na Borrower to a Supplier);  \ng) Step 7:  this is the same as Step 4 (i.e. a Return of Prepayment was \nmade from a Supplier to a Borrower);  \nStep 7a:  this is the same as Step 4a (i.e. a currency \nconversion);  \nh) Step 8:  this is the same as Step 3 (i.e. the Borrower ma de another \nRelevant Drawdown); and  \n \n21  All 75 Returns of Prepayments were subject to currency conversion (either in full or \nin part) before making the subsequent Prepayment.

This loss was compensated by further  drawdowns in\nsmall amounts , which were exactly equal to the amount “lost” in\nconversion. I refer to these  as FX Top -ups, and list them  in Appendix\n3-3-3. Of the 104 FX Top -ups we identified, 51 occurred  before  the\nReturn of Prepayment was paid into the Borrower’s account (which\nwas at least partly converted from USD to UAH and back to USD to\nfund the subsequent Prepayment).34 The timing of the se FX Top-ups\nimplies  that the Borrower was preparing to make the subsequent\nPrepayment before it received the Return of Prepayment.\n3.14 I address each of these points in Appendix 3 -3-4, which explains currency \nconversion, PF Charges and FX Top -ups in more detail . \n33Mr Beketov’s eighth expert report dated 23 November 2021 , paragraph 377.  \n34Appendix 3 -3-3, column M.  \nD1/1/34\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 35 Figure 3-2: Particulars of the Bank’s case  \n \nNote: The precise number and order of steps varies by transaction, as illustrated in Appendi ces 3-2-1 to 3-2-46.\nD1/1/35\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 36 Is the Bank’s case on how the Relevant Drawdowns funded  the \nUnreturned Prepayments accurate?  \nScope of work  \n3.15 In order to assess the accuracy of the Bank’s case, we r eviewed the accounts \nof the 46 Borrowers from which the Bank claims Unreturned Prepayments \nwere paid to Defendant Suppliers .

(See further at paragraphs  3.160  to \n3.168 ). \n3.17 We established that all the Unreturned Prepayments were funded by \nRelevant Drawdowns. (See further at paragraphs  3.18  to 3.22 , and 3.16 4). \nRelevant Drawdowns  \nOverview  \n3.18 The Bank’s case is that  Relevant Drawdowns under Relevant Loans  funded \nUnreturned Prepayments to Defendant Suppliers (and have not been validly \nrepaid).  \n3.19 The Bank made loans to the Borrowers between at least 2 August 20 10 and \n16 December 2016 .40 Drawdowns under c ertain of these loans funded \nPrepayments to Suppliers. Drawdowns under a  subset of these loans, \nnamely the Relevant Loans, funded Unreturned Prepayments to the \nDefendant Suppliers.  \n \n38  The Bank’s transactional data and the work we undertook in relation to it  is \ndescribed at Appendix 3-3-5. \n39  Payments between customers of the Bank’s Ukraine head office and those of the \nBank’s Cyprus Branch were not made directly from one customer account  to \nanother. Instead, they were made from a paying customer’s account to a Bank \ninternal account, and subsequently from a different  Bank internal account to the \nreceiving customer’s account. As described above, we matched Prepayments and \nReturns of Prepaym ents between Borrowers and Suppliers in accounts of the \nBorrowers. However, we verified that Prepayments made by Borrowers were \nreceived in accounts of the Suppliers at the Bank’s Cyprus Branch. Similarly, we \nverified that Returns of Prepayments received b y Borrowers were made from \naccounts of the Suppliers at the Bank’s Cyprus Branch.  \n40  According to the Bank’s transactional data . \nD1/1/37\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 38 3.20 The drawdowns under these Relev ant Loans which funded the Unreturned \nPrepayments are the Relevant Drawdowns.  \n3.21 We identified 270 Relevant Drawdowns under 134 Relevant Loans, totalling \nUSD 2,335,943,519 .

This is illustrated in Figure 3-3 below, \nwhich sets out a hypothetical example using Steps 1 to 6 of the Bank’s case.41  \n3.25 As illustrated below, Steps 1 and 3 compris e Relevant Drawdowns of \nUSD  50 million and USD 30 million respectively.42 However, the total value \nof Relevant Drawdowns (i.e. USD  80 million) is  greater than the value of the  \nPrepayment s and Returns of Prepayments which the Relevant Drawdowns \nfunded (i.e. USD 50 million).43 This is because part of the Return of \nPrepayment (Step 4) funded a loan repayment of USD 30 million (Step 5).  In \nthis example , a Relevant Drawdown  partly  repaid a n earlier  Relevant \nDrawdown (for which the Bank does not claim).   \n3.26 This scenario accounts for the vast majority of the difference between the \nvalue of Relevant Drawdowns and the value of Unreturned Prepayments . \nThe remaining difference ( i.e. USD 11. 8 million) arises largely from Relevant \nDrawdowns which were FX Top -ups. A li st of FX Top -ups is set out in \nAppendix 3-3-3.44 \n \n41  The values in this example do not correspond to a specific Borrower but were \nchosen to explain the difference between the va lue of Relevant Drawdowns and \nthe value of Unreturned Prepayments.  \n42  In Figure 3-2, Step 8 is also a Relevant Drawdown.  \n43  USD 80 million = USD 50 million (Step 1) + U SD 30 million (Step 3).  \n44  Other small differences arise from  FX currency conversions from UAH to USD.   \nD1/1/39\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 40 Figure 3-3: Steps 1 to 6 of the Bank’s case ( hypothetical example)  \nBorrowers\nStep 5 : Repayment of loans \nand interest\nUSD 30mStep 3 : Relevant \nDrawdowns \nUSD 30mStep 2 : Prepayments\nUSD 50m\nStep 4 : Returns of Prepayments\n(approximately 90 days later)\nUSD 50m\nStep 6 : Prepayments\nUSD 50mBank SuppliersStep 1 : Relevant \nDrawdowns\nUSD 50m\nUSD \n20mUSD \n30m\nD1/1/40\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 41 Prepayments  \n3.27 Relevant Drawdowns were used to make Prepayments  to a Supplier’s \naccount at the Bank’s Cyprus Branch .45  \n3.28 Prepayments which are  relevant to the Bank’s case were made under 129 \nSupply Agreements.

This is an example of Relevant Drawdo wns directly funding an \nUnreturned Prepayment.\n \n51  The six worked examples are representative of the other examples in the Bank’s \ncase.

It is therefore an \nUnreturned  Prepayment . \n3.157  The Unreturned Prepayment of USD 28,770,600 from Alfatrader to Collyer \nwas funded with half the payment of USD  58,000,000  from Adriana United \nto Alfatrader (i.e.  that which did not fund the payment to Glasgow \nCommercial).

In the remaining instance, the date differs by three days.  \n135  The Prepayments were made by Borrowers, some of the remaining  193 Borrowers \nand other borrowers.  \nD1/1/99\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 100 b) the lower part shows the total by “ Base No ” (see paragraph  \n3.188 ).136,137 It also groups the totals and codes them by colour. \nHowever, it is unclear what the colour coding means.  \n3.188  The third row sets out details of each Prepayment, as follows:  \na) column A, headed “ Base No ”, records the customer number;138  \nb) column B, headed “ Resident ”, records the name of the Ukrainian \nborrower;  \nc) column C, headed “ Attribution ”, records a category for each \nUkrainian borrower. It is unclear what this category relates to;139 \nd) column D, headed “ Amount, USD ”, records the amount of the \nPrepayment which was outs tanding under a Supply Agreement \nreference  at the date of the worksheet, in USD;140, 141 \ne) column E, headed “ Date of payment ”, records the date the \nPrepayment was made;142 \n \n136  “Base No” is a customer number. However, it is diffe rent to the field “ CRF” in the \nBank’s transactional data, which records a customer reference number.  \n137  In certain instances, the total is adjusted. For example, in the worksheet entitled \n“140314 ”, an amount is deducted from the total set out in row 79.

(See the footnote below).  \n142  Where there was more than one Prepayment with the same Supply Agreement \nreference over several days, the worksheet groups them together and sets out the \nearliest payment date. If there was an additional Prepayment with the same Supply \nAgreement reference several weeks later, the worksheet sets out this payment in \na different row. For example, in the worksheet entitled “ 110414 ”, the Prepayments \nof USD 28,77 0,600 and USD 10,000,000 from Alfatrader to Lemiserf Investments \nwere both made under Supply Agreement reference 1302LA -1, dated 13 February \n2014.

A Prepayment does not appear on \nworksheets dated after it was returned in full (i.e. each sheet only records \nPrepayments which were  unreturned at the relevant date).  \n3.191  The total amount of Prepayments, both the “ Amount, USD ”, and the \n“Amount repayable at 85 day term, USD ” are set out in row 2 at the top of \nthe table. At 30 December 2013 (i.e. the date of the first worksheet), the \nPrepaym ents total USD 1,199,381,370. At 1 September 2014 (i.e. the date of \nthe last worksheet), the Prepayments total USD 1,911,877,385  (i.e. exactly \nthe same amount as the Unreturned Prepayments at paragraphs 3.1 and \n3.35  above . \n3.192  Certain worksheets contain Prepayments which are formatted in blue \nfont,145 which fall into two categories:  \na) in blue and non -bold type , which are part ly returned Prepayments; \nand \nb) in blue and bold type , which are described as “ Currency revenue ” \nPrepayments.  \n3.193  In the case of blue and non -bold Prepayments, we confirmed by reference \nto the Bank’s transactional data that they were par tly returned by reference \nto their Supply Agreements at the date of the worksheet.146, 147 \n \n145  I do not provide  an exhaustive list. However, almost all the workshe ets contain \nsome  Prepayments in blue font.  \n146  In all but two instances , the outstanding Prepayment amount is set out in the \n“Amount, USD ” and the “ Amount repayable at 85 day term, USD ” columns. In the \ncase of a Prepayment of USD 53,045,000 from Forsa to Co rmack on 17  December \n2013, the “ Amount, USD ” column sets out the full Prepayment amount rather than \nthe outstanding amount at the date of the worksheet. This appears in two \nworksheets, entitled “ 190314 ” and “ 240314 ”.  \n147  As set out above, Prepayments made under the same Supply Agreement reference \nover several weeks were recorded in different rows. In those cases where a partial \nReturn of Prepayment related only to one of the rows, the remaining row was not \nformatted in blue font.  \nD1/1/103\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 104 3.194  For example, the worksheet entitled “ 190514 ” records a Prepayment of \nUSD  13,000,000 from Vialint to Spircom Investments under Supply \nAgreement refere nce 1202SV/1 , dated 12 February 2014.

Other \ncolumns may have been calculated using formulae and the numbers hardcoded  in \nthe spreadsheet. We have not verified the arithmetic accuracy of the Gurieva \nSpreadsheet.

This repayment was recorded in the Bank’s transactional data at \n19 November 2014, but was not reflected in the Guri eva Spreadsheet.  \n162  Similar to the Kazantsev Spreadsheet, the Gurieva Spreadsheet sets out a part of \nthe transaction narrative in column AE, entitled “ Contract scope ”. We only \ncompared the Supply Agreement reference and date  in this column to the Bank’s \ntransactional data.  \n163  The worksheet entitled “ 010914 ”.  \nD1/1/109\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 110 3.211  Both the Kazantsev and Gurieva Sprea dsheets record the Supply Agreement \nreferences for specific Prepayments and Returns of Prepayments  between \nBorrowers and Suppliers.164 \n3.212  Prepayments appear to have been removed from the Kazantsev \nSpreadsheet when they were returned under the same Supply Agree ment \nreference. The worksheets in the Kazantsev Spreadsheet indicate that this \noccurred regularly (i.e. Prepayments were removed every few days).  \n3.213  Both the Kazantsev Spreadsheet and the Gurieva Spreadsheet show the \nsame Unreturned Prepayments from Borrowers  to Defendant Suppliers by \nreference to the Relevant Supply Agreements  the last time they were \nupdated (i.e.  1 September 2014 in the case of the Kazantsev Spreadsheet \nand 19  November 2014 in the case of the Gurieva Spreadsheet).  \n3.214  Hence, read together, these  spreadsheets indicate that there were \nno Returns of Prepayments under the Relevant Supply Agreements in the \n79 days between the dates of the two documents  (which is consistent with \nthe Bank’s transactional data).

This loan is also set out in his analysis of \nRelevant Loans. Hence, it is duplicated and should only appear in his analysis \nof Relevant Loans.  \nScope of work \n4.8 We reviewed the First Defendant’s analysis and established that he only \nconsidered the direct  source of repayment s of Relevant Loans  and \nIntermediary  Loans  (i.e. he only identified the account from which \nrepayments were made, as recorded in the Bank’s tran sactional data , and \ndid not alwa ys identify where the funds in that account originated) .174, 175  \n4.9 In contrast to the First Defendant’s approach, we went on to identify the \nultimate  source of repayment  of Relevant Drawdowns , whether  this was \n“cash”, the Asset Transfer , the Transformation , or otherwise.  The Asset \nTransfer is described further in paragraphs 4.25  to 4.50  and the \nTransformation in paragraphs 4.51  to 4.62 . We limited our analysis to \nRelevant Drawdowns rather than Relevant Loans in their entirety, because \nit is Relevant Drawdowns which funded the Unreturned Prepayments .176  \n \n174  When I talk about repayment I refer to the amount by which the Bank’s \ntransactional data implies that the relevant outstanding loan balances were \nreduced at the applicable time.  \n175  Where the First Defendant says that Relevant Loans were directly repaid by Asset \nTransfer or via the Transformation, he does identif y from  where the funds in the \nBorrower’s account originated (i.e. from one of these two sources).  \n176  For the avoidance of doubt, where I consider the repayment of Relevant \nDrawdowns, it is the repayment of principal, and not interest, on the Relevant \nLoans.  \nD1/1/115\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 116 4.10 I do not express an opinion on whether the se purported repayments of \nRelevant Drawdowns  were valid, or whether purported  repayment with \n“cash” , by Asset Transfer or  via the Transformation would reduce the Bank’s \nloss as a matter of law .

In Section 7 I go on to consider the eff ect \non the loss suffered by the Bank of the “true” value of the assets, as I understand \nwill be addressed in the expert reports of Mr. Bezant, Ms. Razzhivina  and Mr. \nThomas  (each of which ha s been provided to me in final but unsigned form) . \n178  We identifie d some minor discrepancies between the way in which assets are \ndescribed in the Bank’s transactional data and the schedules to D1’s RRAD. \nHowever,  these discrepancies do  not affect the amount  of loans repaid.  \nD1/1/116\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 117 4.13 In respect of Relevant Drawdowns, w e established that  substantially all  the \n“cash ” repayments originated  from Intermediary Drawdowns . Apart  from \ninstances where Relevant Drawdowns repaid either themselves and/ or \nother  Relevant Drawdowns ( and a handful of other instances described  \nbelow ), we determined that “ cash ” repayments  were  ultimately  funded by \nAsset Transfer  and/or the Transformation .179 This is because , although \n“cash ” originated from Intermediary Drawdowns, those Intermediary \nDrawdowns were themselves repaid by  Asset Transfer  and/or the \nTransformation .180 Figure 4-1 below depicts such  an example.  \n \n179  i.e. although an Intermediary Loan may have repaid a Relevant Drawdown, the \nIntermediary Loan was itself repaid by Asset Transfer or via the Transformation.  \n180  I note that there are many instances in which there are several “layers” of \nIntermediary Drawdowns. For example, one of Tamersa’s Relevant D rawdowns has \n13 layers of Intermediary Drawdowns before the ultimate source of repayment is \nidentified (and, therefore, has 1 4 layers in total). (See Appendix 4 -5, which provides \nmore detail in respect of r epayment of Relevant Drawdowns with “cash” ). \nD1/1/117\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 118 Figure 4-1: Example of “cash” repayments originating from Intermediary \nDrawdowns where the ultimate source of funding is by Asset Transfer and \nvia the Transformation  \n4.14 Indeed, t he Asset  Transfer  and the Transformation  account for  \napproximately 78%  of the ultimate repayment  of Relevant Drawdowns .181 \nFurther, only 0.1% of total repayments can be shown to come from  cash \nfrom external sources .

This asset  appears  to have been \ntransferred in two separate transactions by two different entities.  \nThe Cypriot Assets  \n4.29 At the date the Cypriot Assets we re transferred to the Bank (i.e. 22 August \n2016), the Bank’s transactional data records 10 transactions, totalling \nUSD  163.9 million, which purportedly repaid outstanding balances on 10 \nloans. Seven of these transactions repaid Relevant Loans, and the remaining \nthree repaid “other” loans. These transactions are summarised in Appendix \n4-2-2.

(See items 1 -7 in \nAppendix 4 -2-2). In Schedule 2, the First D efendant individually identifies  \nfive aircraft in the column entitled “ Asset Description ” of these seven \ntransactions. Hence, the First Defendant’s case appears to be that five \naircraft were transferred at a value of USD 161.7 million.  \n4.31 The Bank’s transacti onal data also shows that nine  aircraft were sold to \nDilorsano Consulting in nine  transactions between 23 and 25 August 2016. \nThese transactions amount to USD 163.9 million (i.e. the same figure as the \n10 transactions recorded when the aircraft were transf erred to the Bank), \nand are summarised in Appendix 4 -2-3.

They a mount to USD 96.2 million. (See items 1 -5 in Appendix 4 -2-3). \n4.32 Hence, according to the Bank’s transactional data, the value attributed to \nthe five aircraft identified by the First Defendant is USD  96.2 million,  and not \nUSD 161.7 million as set out  in Schedu le 2 to D1’s RRAD.  \nD1/1/123\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 124 4.33 Except for one transaction which was later reversed,191 the First Defendant \nidentified the same transactions summarised in Table 4-4 in Annex A to D1’s \nRRFI .

Hence, the asset transfers were matched to \nloans by reference to the date and amount of the transactions which \nreduced the balance on the loan accounts. D1’s RRFI sets out t he \nmethodology by which individual assets (and groups of assets) were \nidentified as the source of purported repayment.  \n4.46 According to this analysis, i n many instances more than one asset repaid one \nor more loans. They did so simultaneously (i.e. on the same day), such that \nthere is a “many -to-one” or “many -to-many” relationship between assets \nand loans.

Therefore, in our analysis of how the Relevant Drawdowns \nwere purportedly repaid, we sought to identify the ultimate  (i.e. final)  \nsource of th e “cash ” and therefore the ultimate  source of repayment  of \nRelevant Drawdowns . We set out the results of that analysis in the following \nsection.  \n4.64 As described below, w e took account of  repayments relating only to \nRelevant Drawdowns , and not those relating to other ( non-Relevant ) \ndrawdowns  under Relevant Loans  (or those relating to pa yment of interest \nunder Relevant Loans) , because it was the Relevant Drawdowns which \nfunded the Unreturned Prepayments . Accordingly, w e began  by allocating \nrepayments to Relevant Drawdowns . An illustration of how we allocated \nrepayments to Relevant Drawdow ns is set out in Appendix 4-4.  \n4.65 We sought to identify the ultimate source of repayment by reviewing the \naccount which paid  the Relevant Loan account  in repayment of the Relevant \nDrawdown , as follows:  \na) where a payment related to Asset Transfer  or the Transformation , \nwe identified this as the  final  or ultimate  source of repayment. I refer \nto this as direct  repayment of a Relevant Drawdown;  \nb) where a payment was made from a current account, we sought to \nidentify the ultimate  source of funds  as follows:  \nD1/1/132\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 133 i. where a loan repayment was funded by a Return of \nPrepayment , we identified the source of funds using the \nBank’s methodology of linking Prepayments and Returns of \nPrepayments  (i.e. using Supply Agreement references );205 \nand \nii. where a loan repayment was not funded by a Return of \nPrepayment, we identified the source of funds using Exact \nMatching .206 \n4.66 In some instances, we traced the funds through several loans , which  were \nthemselves repaid.207 (See Appendix 4 -5, which describes the repayment of \nRelevant Drawdowns with “cash” in further detail ). We then went on to \nidentify whether the  ultimate  source of repayment was Asset Transfer, the \nTransformation, or another source . I refer to this as indirect  repayment of a \nRelevant Drawdown.208 \n4.67 I refer to th e method described above as the Bank’s Methodology , since it \ntakes account of Supply Agreement references. It is explained further in \nAppendix 4 -4 with a theoretical example, which shows how Relevant \nDrawdo wns were apportioned between the ultimate sources of repayment. \n(See further at paragraph 4.70 ). \n \n205  We used  Exact Matching to identify the source of the funds which  were credited to \nthe loan account. From there, we matched Prepayments to Returns of Prepayments \nusing the Supply Agreement reference.  \n206  For Borrowers Metrikom, Paradiz, Profit and Ortika, we ident ified that a loan \nrepayment was funded from a deposit account. We matched this repayment  to the \nonly payment into the deposit account. Although the funds could not be matched \nusing Exact Matching, there were no other funds in the account from which the \nrepayment could have been made.  \n207  One such example involved 1 4 “layers” of loans in increasingly small, apportioned \nrepayments.

I \nrefer to this method as the Alternative Methodology , which is also explained \nin Appendix 4 -4. \n4.69 We identified that the ultimate sources of repayment were as follows:209 \na) the Asset Transfer. (Further details of this source of repayment are \nset out in Appendix 4 -6-1); \nb) the Transformation. (Further details of this source of repayment are \nset out in Appendix 4 -6-2); \nc) we were unable to identify the source  of the repayment for one of \nthe fo llowing reasons . (Further details of this are set out in Appendix \n4-6-3): \ni. because the funds could not  be followed with any certainty  \nsince they were  mixed with many other payments ; or \nii. because the funds in the account originated from a \nPrepayment which had already been allocated  to another \nrepayment.  \nd) a foreign exchange gain . (Further details of this source of repayment \nare set out in  Appendix 4 -6-4); \ne) external sources (i.e. funds which appear to derive from  a single \ntrading account of Ukrtatnafta). (Further details of this source of \nrepayment are set out in Appendix 4 -6-5); and  \nf) Relevant Drawdowns which repaid themselves and/or other \nRelevant Drawdowns. (Further details of this source of repayment \nare set out in Appendix  4-6-6).210 \n \n209  The repayment of Relevant Drawdowns of Borrowers Metrikom, Paradiz, Profit and \nOrtika involve interest earned on funds in deposit accounts.

However, most of \nwhat the First Defendant describes as “ cash ” originated from Intermediary \nDrawdowns (i.e. other loans from the Bank), and almost all this “cash” was \nultimately  funded by Asset Transfer  and/or the Transformation . Further, \nunder the  Banks’  Methodology, at least  94% of Relevant Drawdowns were  \nultimately repaid by Asset Transfer, via the Transformation or by Relevant \nDrawdow ns, and not with cash from external sources .

I have considered Mr . Yatsenko’s \nwitness statement and, in particular, paragraphs 37 to 48. These paragraphs \npurport to explain (in general terms) a “service” offered by the Bank which  involved \nthe use of “mock  supply agreements” by customers of the Bank.  The description at \nparagraphs 37 to 48 is presente d without reference to the Bank’s case , or any \nspecific transactions in the Bank’s transactional data . Hence , as matters stand, I am \nunable to analyse his description forensically, or draw any conclusions from it.  \n213  D1’s RRAD paragraph 56.  \n214  D1’s RRAD, p aragraph 58.  \n215  We have performed our analysis on the spreadsheets attached to  \nLafferty 4.  \n216  Lafferty 2, paragraph 12.  \nD1/1/138\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 139 5.2 It is unclear who undertook  this “Tracing Exercise ”. I note that the First \nDefendant states:  \n“Mr Kolomoisky personally and a team put together by him have \nbeen work ing hard to establish where the money which is alleged \nby the Bank to have been misappropriated went (i .e. the Tracing \nExercise). As the Court will understand when it reads the below, that \nhas been a very substantial exercise indeed, and has required the \nassistance of many individuals.”217 \n5.3 In any event, the  “Tracing Exercise”  purport s to demonstrate the destination \nof the Relevant Drawdowns  (and, indeed, both non -Relevant drawdowns \nunder Relevant Loans , and drawdowns under other loans to the Borrowers \nwhich are not Relevant Loans) . The Lafferty Spreadsheets  purport to \nillustrate Payment Chains  by which drawdowns under Relevant Loans were  \nreturned to  the Bank . They are said to have done so (primarily) by  repa ying \nthe loan s of the Borrowers and  other clie nts of the Bank .218,219 I note that t he \nFirst Defendant’s “Tracing Exercise ” does not take account of references in \nthe transaction na"}

(Source:  D1 RRAD paragraph 57(g)). This is referred to in the \nLafferty Spreadsheets as “ Other usage ”, which “ reflects transaction costs, currency \nexchange costs and minor discrepancies as I explained in Lafferty 2 paragraphs \n78-82”. (Source:  Lafferty 3, paragraph 123 ). \n220  In three of the 908 unique  Payment Chains, the Return of Prepayment refers to the \nsame Supply Agreement as the Prepayment . We refer to the Payment Chains as \nInkeriya_02, Viglon_02 and Vegatorg_02  in Appendix 5 -1-2, wh ich is an annotated \nversion of the Lafferty Spreadsheets . The Supply Agreement references in the \nPayment Chains  are set out  in Appendix 5 -1-2-4.  \nD1/1/139\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 140 5.4 The Lafferty Spreadsheets  set out what appear to be 926 Payment Chains in \nmore than  6,000 rows of data.221 In cert ain instances, drawdowns under \nRelevant Loans  are shown to combine with other drawdowns ultimately to \nrepay a loan.  Indeed , the Lafferty Spreadsheets purport to show the \ndestination of all loans of  the 46  Borrowers drawn down in the Relevant \nPeriod , totalling USD 6.50 billion. 197 of the 908 unique Payment Chains \nrelate to Relevant Drawdowns , totalling USD 2.21 billion.222, 223, 224 \n5.5 In this regard, t he First Defendant identifies  three types of Payment Chain, \nas follows :225 \na) Same Borrower Chain : funds drawn down under the Relevant Loan \nare said to repay a loan of the same Borrower , whether under the \nsame Relevant Loan, a different Relevant Loan or a non -Relevant \nLoan;  \n \n221  It is unclear where certain Payment Chains begin and end , owing to errors and \nmissing information ; hence , 926 is an approximation. Further, certain Payment \nChains relate to more than one Borrower , and therefore some or all of the \ntransactions have been duplicated. There appear to be 908 unique  Payment Chains.  \n222  The Lafferty Spreadsheets include Relevan t Drawdowns of USD 2.21 billion. This \nexcludes the Relevant Draw downs by the Cypriot Borrowers (totalling U SD 118 \nmillion) and Prominmet (of USD 18,190,455), as set out in Appendix 3 -3-1. Any \nfurther minor discrepancy is likely to  be due to foreign exchange  differences.  \nFurther, two Payment Chains include non -Relevant drawdowns as well as Relevant \nDrawdowns, as follows: (i) Intorno_01 contains a drawdown of UAH 16,731,000 \nmade by Empire (equivalent to USD  1,936,346); and (ii) Real -Standart_07 contains \na draw down of UAH 67,938,900 (equivalent to USD 8,499,800) made by Real -\nStandart .  \n223  In Lafferty 4, a Payment Chain was added to the Lafferty Spreadsheets in respect of \nthe Borrower Tekhspets. The information in relation to this Payment Chain appears \nto be inco mplete, and the time period to which it relates is after the Relevant \nPeriod. As such, we have not included it in our analysis.  \n224  The Lafferty Spreadsheets omit certain information which is required  to follow the \nfunds flo w in the Payment Chains. For exa mple, they  omit: (i)  payments between \naccounts of the same customer; and (ii) currency  conversions.  \n225  Lafferty 2, paragraphs 56.1  "}

Annex B to the Bank’s RRFI records that the Relevant \nDrawdowns total approximately USD  2.33  billion.  \n \n5.6 In many instances , the Payment Chains involve a  long and complex  series of \ntransactions , often involving dozens of offsho re entities  which are \ncustomers of the Bank’s Cyprus Branch .226 For example, the Cypriot leg of \nthe Payment Chain which sets  out the funds  flow  following drawdowns by \nIntorno , Empire  and Ribotto between 14 February 2014 and 27  February \n2014 , consisted of 72  payments . These payments involved  40 companies \nregistered in offshore jurisdictions including BVI, Belize and Nevis . (See \nparagraphs 5.143  to 5.145 ). \n \n226  The First Defendant himself commented, “ Some of the transaction chains in these \nAnnexes are very long indeed ” (Source:  Lafferty 2, paragraph 34.6).  \nD1/1/141\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 142 5.7 In instances  involving payments between customers of the Bank’s Cyprus \nBranch (and, in certain instances, PB Latvia ), the Lafferty Spreadsheets are \naccompanie d by entries in “ Annex A ”, which purports to illustrate the \nmovement of funds between the relevant entities . In total , Annex A \ncomprises 66 Payment Chains.227 \n5.8 In addition to their inherent complexity, some of these Payment Chains \ninclude  a so-called Break P oint. The First Defendant’s evidence states that a  \nBreak Point occurs when : \n “…there is a gap in the chain [of payments] between origin and \ndestination, such that it is not immediately apparent how the chain \nconnects, and the final money repaid to the Bank  appears to \noriginate from somewhere else.”228 \n5.9 Taking a simplified example, Entity #1 receives funds which originated from \na Relevant Drawdown (Leg #1). Separately, Entity #2 provides funds (the \norigin of which is not specified), which were ultimately used to repay a loan \n(Leg #2).  \n5.10 At this point, the Payment Chain has two unconnected legs, and \nconsequently funds cannot be “traced”  between the two .  \n \n227  i.e. 66 unique Payment Chains (where transactions have not been duplicated).  \n228  Lafferty 2, paragraph 70.  \nD1/1/142\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 143 5.11 However, the First Defendant’s case is that, following the Break Point, \nso-called Compensation Payment s are made, either directly from Entity #1 \nto Entity #2, or indirectly via another entity or entities, "}

I consider  Break Points and \nCompensation Payments in more detail in paragrap hs 5.49  to 5.55  and 5.94  \nto 5.134 . \n5.12 The First Defendant also makes the following assertions about the \nUnreturned Prepayments:  \na) in most cases (approximat ely USD 1.58 billion), the Unreturned \nPrepayments were not directly  funded by Relevant Drawdowns \nbecause the Borrower  “either had no relevant prior borrowing, or all \nrelevant borrowing had been paid out to other recipients and/or had \nbeen repaid .”229 The First Defendant refers to this as Non -Relevant \nMoney .230 I note that he does not make the same assertion in respect  \nof the other Unreturned Prepayments (approximately USD  0.33 \nbillion);  \nb) some of the Unreturned Prepayments were banking transactions , \nwhic h the First Defendant describes as Clearing Transactions . He \nasserts that tr ansactions of this sort allowed customers to set -off \nmutual indebtedness without either customer having sufficient \nfunds to make the payment  (and therefore, similar to Non -Relevant  \nMoney, the se Unreturned Prepayments  were not funded by \nRelevant Drawdowns) . I consider Clearing Transactions at paragraphs \n5.234  to 5.250 ;231 \nc) certain transactions  in the Bank’s analysis were made to a Nevis  \nentity called ZAO Ukrtransitservice,  instead of  the BVI Defendant \nSupplier of the same name.

The steps can be summarised as \nfollows (as illustrated in Figure 5-4 below):237 \nSteps set out  in the Lafferty Spreadsheets  \na) Step 1:  a Borrower made a Relevant Drawdown ;238 \nb) Step 2:  shortly thereafter, t he Borrower made a Prepayment to a \nSupplie r; \nc) Step 3:  the Supplier made a payment (which was not always in the \nsame  amount as the Prepayment )239 back to the same Borrower, \nanother Borrower, or  a “third party” (i.e. an O ther Nam ed Customer  \nof the Bank ). This payment was sometimes direct , but other times  \nindirect  “through a chain of other companies ”240 (i.e. the Payment \nChains ). The payments in these chains did not refer to the same \nSupply Agreement as the preceding Prepayment in Step 2 ; 241  \n \n237  Lafferty 3, paragraph 48.  \n238  The Lafferty Spreadsheets set out all drawdowns made by the 46 Borrowers in the \nRelevant Period. However, they do not explicitly identify Relevant or Intermediary \nDrawdowns. Where I consider it helpful to do so, I have specified that a drawdown \nis a Relevant or Intermediary Drawdown.  \n239  The First Defendant uses the term “ very slightly smaller  sum”. (Source : Lafferty 3, \nparagraph 48(4)). However, the payment was not always smaller nor “very slightly ” \nsmaller. (See further at paragraphs  5.221  to 5.228 ). For example, on 30 April 2014 , \nIndustrial Garant made a Prep ayment of USD  5.4 million  to the Fifth Defendant . The \nFifth Defendant  made a subsequent paymen t of USD  7.9 million to Marganetsk iy. \nThe First Defendant contends that these payments are the same funds.

The First \nDefendant does not explain the source of the Non -Relevant Money \n(which he also refer s to as “ external non -relevant loan fund s”);243 \nf) Step 6:  the Supplier paid the Non -Relevant Money to the Borrower \nwho made the Relevant Drawdown in Step  1.

Each \nworkbook contains one or both  of the following worksheets:  \na) a Borrower Worksheet, which sets out a summary of how an \nindividual Borrower’s drawdowns were purportedly applied \nbetween 1 April 2013 and 10 September 2014 ;246, 247 and \nb) in instances where the Borrower Worksheet refers to “ Movements \nwithin Cyprus Branch ”, an Annex A,  which sets out the payments \nmade in Cyprus.248, 249 \n5.17 I describe the layout of these worksheets in Appendix 5-1-1.  \n5.18 In order to assess the accuracy and completeness of the Lafferty \nSpreadsheets, we consolidated the 46 Borrower Workbooks into two \nworkbooks, as follows:  \na) “Annotated Borrower Worksheets”, which s ets out the Payment Chains \nin respect of all 46 Borrowers. ( See Appendix 5-1-2-1); and  \nb) “Annotated Annex A”, which sets out the payments in the Bank’s Cyprus \nBranch for the Payment Chains in respect of all 46  Borrowers. ( See \nAppendix 5-1-3). \n5.19 I describe the se workbooks in Appendix 5-1-4. \n \n246  It also shows other Borrower ’s drawdowns  where they are said to combine with \nthe named Borrower’s drawdown to make a repayment. These drawdowns are \nduplicated in the other Borrower’s  Worksheet.  \n247  The “Relevant Period” is defined as April 2013 to September 2014 ( Source : \nD1’s  RRAD, paragraph 2). Each Borrower Worksheet states i t contains “ All \nBorrowings by [the Borrower]  from 01.04.2013 until 10.09.2014 ”. However, the \nLafferty Spreadsheets set out drawdowns outside this period (e.g.  Tekhspets made \na drawdown in October 2014 and another in January 2015).

For example, Tseris made drawdowns totalling  USD  267,482,161 and \nrepayments totalling  USD  297,832,824.  Hence, it repaid USD 30,350,663 more than \nit drew down.

I have \nidentified examples where, even applying the principles of tracing which I \nunderstand the First Defendant pur ports to rely on ( i.e. Exact  Matching ), and \nignoring payment references in the Bank’s transactional data, the Lafferty \nSpreadsheets are inaccurate and/or incomplete.  \n5.28 Further, t his analysis does not seek to compare the First Defendant’s \n“Tracing Exercise” w ith the Bank’s cas e (which is considered elsewhere in \nthis report). Nothing in this section should be taken as an endorsement of \nthe First Defendant’s methodology (or elements thereof) in preference to  \nthe Bank’s case. Where I state what the Bank’s transactional data “shows” , I \nam refer ring to what the  Bank’s  transactional data supports , if analysed in \naccordance with what I understand the First Defendant’s purported \nmethodology  to be  (i.e. I have ignored payment references which, on the \nBank’s case,  link payments. Instead, I have used, or sought to use, Exact \nMatching, in order to consider the First Defendant’s “Tracing Exercise” on a \nlike-for-like basis).   \n5.29 I have not  sought to set out an exhaustive list of the issues we identified with \nthe Lafferty Spreadsheets. I address only  those issues which  I consider most \nrelevant to understanding the extent of the deficiencies in the  First \nDefendant’s “Tracing Exercise”.  \n \n253  The First Defendant identified USD 429,713,200 of Relevant Loans which were paid \ndirectl y to the Defendant Suppliers (i.e. he indicates that the funds were “ Paid \nthrough D3 -D8” in column O). However, he omitted four Prepayments which were \ndirectly funded (in part) by Relevant Drawdowns, totalling USD  124,513,434.  \nD1/1/156\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 157 5.30 I should also note that m y analysis is limited to analysing  the transactions  \nand whether they are supported by the Bank’s transactional data . I do not \nexpress a view on whether, as a matter of law, the “Tracing Exercise” is \npermissible or appropriate.  \nSummary of findings  \n5.31 Despite being described as a “Tracing Exercise ”, the First Defendant  does not \nappear to follow, or even purport to follow, a consistent methodology or \napproach.  (See further at paragraphs  5.36  to 5.65 ). \n5.32 The First Defendant states that [his] “ teams have identified each chain based \non their understanding of the generic way the Scheme operated ”254 (i.e. he \ndoes not explain his  methodolo gy). Indeed, I consider it would not be \npossible to reproduce his “Tracing Exercise” in the absence of the Lafferty \nSpreadsheets owing to its inconsistenc ies. In particular : \na) what is presented as the “next” payment in a particular  Payment \nChain appears to have been selected in several different ways \nwithout explanation. (See further at paragraphs 5.39  to 5.48 ); \nb) it is unclear on what basis Payment Chains are said to contain (or \nnot contain) a “ gap in the chain  [of paymen ts]” referred to as a \nBreak Point, nor why a particular point  in the Payment Chain has \nbeen identified as a  Break Point with  associated Compensation \nPayment(s). Further, ignoring the Break Point result s in a different \noutcome  from that contended in the Laf ferty Spreadsheets .

For \nexample : \nf) in 16  instances , drawdowns were incorrectly  traced to a loan \nrepayment. They either repaid another loan , were paid into \nanother account of the same borrower, or were paid to another \nNamed Customer (and were therefore used for another purpose).  \n(See further at paragraphs  5.66  to 5.83 );  \ng) in nine  instances,  the drawdown did not directly fund the loan \nrepayment (s) identified .255 Rather, t he direct or indirect payment \nfrom Supplier to borrower (Step 3) occurred before  the Supplier \nreceived the Prepayment (Step 2) . (See further at paragraphs  5.87  \nto 5.93 ); and \nh) the Compensation Payment mechanism seldom fully works  as the \nFirst Defendant describes : \ni. entities in almost all the Payment Chains (i.e. 39 of 43  \nPayment Chains ) were either under - or over -\n“compensated ”. (See further at paragraphs 5.97  to 5.99 ); \nii. Compensation Payment s were made as many as 62 days \nafter the Break Point. It is unclear how these payments can \nbe considered part of the same Payment Chain. (See further \nat paragraph  5.100 ); and  \niii. the selection of Compensation Payments is unclear, since \nthey appear either unrelated to the Payment Chain , or to \nhave been double -counted. (See further at paragraphs 5.112  \nto 5.120 ). \n5.34 I set out in Table 5-5 below a summary of the inaccuracies and \ninconsistencies  we identified , including the categories and sub -categories \ninto which they  fall.

This is surprising since, according to the \nFirst Defendant, the purpose of the Lafferty Spreadsheets is \nsimply to illustrate that one loan was used to repay another . (See \nfurther at paragraphs  5.139  to 5.150 ). The Financial Action Task \nForce refers to similar characteristics,  as follows:  \n \n256  Of the 908 unique Payment Chains which include drawdowns (totalling \napproximately USD  6.50 billion), there are 179 in which funds were paid to the \nBank’s Cyprus Branch or PB Latvia and were returned to the Bank’s Ukraine hea d \noffice (totalling approximately USD 5.05 billion).  \n257  PB Latvia  was a subsidiary at the time of the payments.

Associated Compensation Payment(s), which are discussed further in \nthis section, subsequently purport to brid ge the gap.  \n5.51 The First Defendant also states:  \n“In most cases, the Tracing Exercise has been relatively \nstraightforward, since it  simply required the teams to follow an \ninitial prepayment to a Defendant Supplier through a series of \nfurther payments to an eve ntual destination.  In those cases, in \nparticular those involving “Break Points” as described below, the \nteams were able to identify the types of transactions for which they \nneeded to search in order successfully to trace those payments, \neither from their o wn knowledge (in the case of ex -Bank employees) \nor from conversations with others in the teams. ”274 \n5.52 However, having reviewed the Payment Chains in full, it is unclear on what \nbasis they are said to contain (or not contain) a Break Point, nor why a \nparticular point in a Payment Chain  has been identified as a  Brea k Point with  \nassociated Compensation Paymen t(s).275 Further, because the information \napparently relied on to “trace” the payments has not been provided, the \nbasis on which the matching occurs cannot be examined or tested. There is \nnothing I have seen in the Bank’s transactional data which  explains w hy two \nlegs of a Break Point should be linked.276 As I go on to illustrate  below , it is \npossible to continue to “trace” funds after the Break Point using one or more \nalternative  approaches ; hence, ignoring the Break Point results in a different \noutcome from  that contended in the Lafferty Spreadsheets . (See further at \nparagraphs 5.121  to 5.134 ). \n \n274  Lafferty 2 , paragraph 21.  \n275  On our analysis, only 43 of the 187 Payment Chains in which payments were made \nto the Bank’s Cyprus Branch (or PB Latvia)  appear to include a Break Point. The \nmethodology we used to identify Payment Chains with a Break Point is set out in \nAppendix  5-4-3. \n276  i.e. the transaction narrative of the payments which the First Defendant describes \nas Break Points and Compensation Pay ments in Annex A do not specify that this is \nwhat they purport to be.  \nD1/1/170\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 171 5.53 I note that Break Points appear to be inconsistent with the First Defendant’s \nclaim that  he has “traced” funds through a “ continuous closed loop of \nfunds ”.277 \n5.54 I also note that  Break Points and Compensation Payments are not \ncharacteristics I have previously encountered when conducting “tracing ” \nexercises.  \n5.55 I set out examples of inconsistencies we identified in relation to Break Points \nand Compensation Payments in paragraphs 5.94  to 5.134  below.  \nThe d rawdown did not directly fund the loan repayment (s) identified  \n5.56 In nine Payment Chains, the drawdown  which funded the Prepayment did \nnot directly  fund the Return of Prepayment or the loan repayment (s) \nidentified  in the Lafferty Spreadsheets .278 Rather , the "}

However, the Bank’s \ntransactional data shows that payments were made to an account at \n“AS Privatbank ” (i.e. PB Latvia).  \n5.60 In three  Payment Chains , the First Defendant appears to have stopped \n“tracing ” after the Prepayment , although it is not clear why . (See further at  \nparagraphs 5.174  to 5.179 ).

I also set \nout an example to illustrate that not ignoring the intervening payments  \nresult s in a different outcome  from that contended in the Lafferty \nSpreadsheets  in paragraphs 5.214  to 5.220 . \nSummary  \n5.64 There does not appear to be a consistent or coherent methodology \nunderlying the Lafferty Spreadsheets.  \n5.65 The First Defendant appears to address the inconsistencies by stating  that \n[his] “ teams have identified each chain based on their understanding of the \ngeneric way the Scheme operated ”285 However, given all the inconsistencies \nidentified above, I consider  it would not be possible to reproduce the First \nDefendant’s “Tracing Exercise ” in the absence of the Lafferty \nSpreadsheets.286 \nInaccurate tracing  \n5.66 As explained in paragraph 5.33 , the Lafferty Spreadsheets contain a number \nof inaccuracies. We have reviewed each P ayment Chain and compared what \nthe Lafferty  Spreadsheets indicate happened  to the drawdowns  with what \nthe Bank’s transactional data shows.  \n5.67 We identified 14 Pa yment Chains which contain 16 inaccuracies (i.e. the \ndrawdowns were incorrectly traced to a loan repayment).287, 288 In certain \ninstances, they were traced to the wrong payment. In others, it is unclear \nhow the funds were used.  \n \n284  Lafferty 3, paragraph 45(d).  \n285  Lafferty 2, paragraph 24.  \n286  Further, as described above, it is unclear who undertook the exercise, or what \nsources of information it relies on.  \n287  The number of Payment Chains is lower than the nu mber of issues in Table 5-9 \nbecause some Payment Chains contain multiple issues.  \n288  10 of the 14 Payment Chains contained Relevant Drawdowns totalling \nUSD  102,942,758.  \nD1/1/173\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 174 5.68 A summary of the issues we identified is set out below in Table 5-9.

ZFZ made  the \nrepayments at 12:24 and 12:25, approximately four hours before  it received \nthe funds from Litorenia Trading at 16: 24. Hence,  the Relevant Drawdown \n(which funded the paymen t to Litorenia Trading)  did not  fund the loan \nrepayments at 12:24 and 12:25 . These loan repayments were in fact funded \nby another drawdown made by ZFZ on 3  April  2014. (See Appendix 5-3-1-2).  \n5.74 Instead, the other h alf of the Relevant Drawdown  appears  to have  \ncontributed to a loan repayment of  USD 4,450,000 of loan 4Z13452D on \n9 April  2014. A further drawdown made by ZFZ on 7 April 2014 funded the \nremainder of this repayment.  \n5.75 I set out a timeline  and diagrams depicting this issue below.

(See paragraphs 5.97  and 5.99 ); \nb) in nine Payment Chains, the Compensation Payments occurred \nfour or more days after the Break Point. (See paragraphs 5.100  \nand 5.111 );299 and   \nc) in six Payment Chains, t he selection of Compensation Payments \nis unclear:   \ni. in one instance, payments which appear totally unrelated \nare selected as part of the same Payment Chain. (See \nparagraphs 5.114  to 5.117 ); and  \nii. in five instances, the First Defendant appears to have \nrepeated a payment in more  than one Payment Chain. \n(See paragraphs 5.118  to 5.119 ).  \n5.96 I explain each of these in more detail below.  \nEntities were either under - or over -compensated  \n5.97 As explained in paragraph 5.11 , each Payment Chain which contains a Break \nPoint involves one or more  Compensation Payment s.

For example, the first \npayment (on  6 May 2014) was USD 27,524,100 from Brimmilton to \nMireltesa Holdings. This is larger than both the drawdown  of \nUSD  12,200,000 (made two days later on 8 May 2014) and the two \npayments back to customers of the Bank’s Ukraine head office  \ntotalling the same amount (also made on 8 May 2014 ).324, 325 The next \npayment was USD  23,770,800 from Mireltesa Holdings to Hangli . \nThere is no explanation for these differences.  \nb) The payments occurred one and two days before  the drawdowns \n(on 6 and 7 May 2014), and the Compensation Payment took place \nseven days later  (on 15 May 2014). The B ank’s transactional data \nshows that, in the seven days between the Break Point and the \nCompensation Payment, there were 36 payments in to and out of \nBrimmilton’s USD current account , as follows:  \ni. 23 payments out of its USD current account, totalling \nUSD  96,348,984; and  \nii. 13 receipts into its USD current account, totalling \nUSD  121,555,000.  \nIt is unclear why these payments are ignored, nor why the payments \nchosen by the First Defendant should be matched.  \n \n324  The two payments were for USD  5,200,000 and USD 7,000,000.  \n325  Further, the Bank’s transactional data shows that it was not Brimmilton which made \nthe payment to Mireltesa Holdings, as set out in Annex A. Brimmilton paid \nUSD  27,524,000 to Lexus Enterprises, another customer at the Bank’s Cyprus \nBranch, which then paid USD 27,524,100 to the Latvian account of \nMireltesa  Holdings.

According to the Bank’s transactional data, the payer and \nrecipient of this transaction are reversed (i.e. even applying the First \nDefendant’s definition of Compensation Payments, Crispex paid \nUSD  10,500,000 to Brimmil ton, not the other way around as set out \nin Annex A ). Therefore, Brimmilton was significantly \nover -compensated and Crispex significantly under -compensated (i.e. \nthe Compensation Payments do not appear to work).  \nCompensation Payments repeated in apparently unrelated Payment Chains  \n5.118  Five payment s are repeated in apparently unrelated Payment Chain s. These \npayments were not apportioned  between Payment Chains (i.e. they were \napplied in full twice) . The methodology used to calculate the Compensation \nPayment differences is set out in Appendix 5-4-3.  \n5.119  For example , Table 5-14 below  illustrates that two  Payment Chains recorded \na payment of USD 3,500,000 from Birgminton Investing to Brimmilton on \n28 May 2014 in Annex A (in rows 42 and 52, highlighted in bold ), as follows:  \na) the payment purportedly “compensated” Brimmilton (in part) for its \npayment of USD  6,500,000 to Halefield Holdings on 26  May 2014 \n(in row 37);326 and  \nb) it was also used to fund a payment of the same amount \n(i.e. USD  3,500,000) from Brimmilton to Hetterington Group (in row 53), \nwhich “compensated” Hetterington Group for its payment of \nUSD  3,500,000 to Hangli  on 27 May 2014 (in  row 47).327 \n5.120  Hence, the payment is double -counted.\n \n326  Referred to as Mastein_04 in Appendix 5 -1-3.

This is identified in the Lafferty Spreadsheets as the \n“break point”.  \n \n5.128  Hence, if the funds were traced using Exact Matching (which, as set out at \nparagraphs 5.40  to 5.42  is a method the First Defendant uses in other cases), \nthe result would be different . \n5.129  Using Exact  Matching, the next payment was to Hangli  in par agraph 5.126  \nd). On the same day, there was a payment for the same amount (i.e. USD \n7,000,000) from Hangli  to Craentex  Investments. However, the next  \npayment from Craentex  Investments to Brimmilton was for USD 10,000,000, \nand subsequent onward payments cannot be followed using Exact \nMatching.332 Hence, the destination of these funds is unclear. (An extract of \nthe Bank’s transactional data is set out in Appendix 5-4-7). \n5.130  Using an alternative approach , the next payments  sequentially  out of \nBirgminton Investing ’s account  were  to Halefield Holdings and Craentex \nInvestments in paragraph 5.126  a) and b). On  the same day, Craentex \nInvestments also received a payment of USD 14,000,000 from Kalten Trade. \nThe combined funds of USD 30,100,000333 appear to repay Lemiserf \nInvestments’ overdraft.334, 335 (An extract of the Bank’s transactional data is \nset out in Appendix 5-4-7). \n5.131  Neither Craentex Investments nor Hangli  were part of the original Payment \nChain set out in the Lafferty Spreadsheets.  \n \n332  The next payment sequentially out of Brimmilton’s account  was a payment of \nUSD  20,500,000 to Carnton Commercial. Carnton Commercial subsequently paid \nAlbot Holdings USD 21,741,000. Albot Holdings used the funds to make a \nrepayment of USD  21,576,000 of loan CY0023/20 , and an interest payment of the \nsame loan of USD 164,817.

(See further in paragraphs 5.174  to 5.179 ); and  \n(ii) three of the Payment Chains (i.e. Kembel_01, Viglon_12 and Viglon_13 in \nAppendix 5 -1-2) repaid loans issued by the Bank’s Cyprus Branc h.  \n345  0.21 / 6.50 bn = 3%.  \n346  D1’s RRAD, paragraphs  56-58. \nD1/1/215\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 216 There is rapid movement  of a high  volume of transactions without any \nobvious commercial rationale  \n5.139  The First Defendant states that Payment Chains occurred over a short period \nof time, as follows:  \n “it is possible to identify connections between payments, and \ntherefore particular chai ns as a whole, with a very high degree of \nconfidence, because they take place in a very short timeframe  and \nthe relevant sums borrowed and repaid are near -identical. ”347 \n5.140  However, the First Defendant does not explain why loans were  drawn down \nand paid back to the Bank  so quickly. The Lafferty Spreadsheets indicate \nthat, in relation to m ore than 60% of Payment Chains  (by number ), the funds \nwere paid back to the Bank within  two days  of the drawdown which \npurportedly funded them .348 This is summarised in Table 5-17 below.  \nTable 5-17: Number  of da ys between the first and last payment in a \nPayment Chain  \nNumber of days between \nthe first and last payment \nin a Payment Chain  Number  of \nPayment  Chains  % Cumulative \n% \n0 (3) 368 40%  40%  \n1 191 21% 62%  \n2 152 17% 78% \n3 88 10%  88%  \n4-30 109 12%  100%  \nTotal  908 100%   \nSource: Appendix 5-5-2. \n \nNote s: (1) Figures in the table are subject to rounding.  \n \n(2) Compensation Payments, which sometimes occurred after loan  \nrepayments , are excluded from this table . \n \n(3) I.e. the first and last payment  were  on the same day . \n \n347  Lafferty 2, paragraph 24 .

(See paragraph 5.137 ). \n358  Lafferty 3, paragraph 49(a).  \n359  I note that this contradicts the First Defendant’s Compensation mechanism, in \nwhich entities are often said to make payments out of their “ own funds ”, befo re \nlater receiving Compensation Payments. This implies that their accounts were not \nin fact “near -empty” . An example of an entity using its own funds in Break Point \nand Compensation Payments is set out in paragraph 5.124 . We have observed other \ninstances in which customers in the Payment Chains have large balances at the time \nthey receive and make payments. See, for example, paragraph 5.109 . \n360  The fact that I agree accounts are near -empty in certain instances has no bearing \non whether I consider the First Defendant’s “Tracing Exercise” to be accurate, or  \n“superior ”, as he descri bes in Lafferty 3, paragraph 49(a).  \nD1/1/219\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 220 Contracts, invoices  and other trade -related  documents  contain  only vague \ndescriptions of the traded goods  (e.g. the subject of the contract is described  \nonly  generically or non -specifically ) \n5.153  Annex A does not record the transaction  narrative for payments between \ncustomers of the Bank’s Cyprus Branch (or PB Latvia). However, the Bank’s \ntransactional data shows that they contain little if any relevant information. \nFor example, they often do not sh ow details of:  \na) the names of the pay er or payee;  \nb) the reference  of the contract or invoice ; or \nc) the type of goods or services referred to there in. \n5.154  Instead, they often refer only to invoices and agreements in a generic sense , \nwith no identifying alphanumeric string for the invoice number. I illustrate \nthis with two examples below , which together account for over half of the \npayments in Annex A . \n“PMNT UNDER INV ” \n5.155  The Bank’s transactional data shows that 223 of 806 payments in Annex A \ncontain the ter m “PMNT UNDER INV ”, followed by a date (e.g.  “PMNT \nUNDER INV  DD 12.05.14. ”).361 These payments occur in 57 of 66 Payment \nChains involving Annex A and relate to 16 different customers.  \nAppendix  5-5-7-1 sets out a list of payments in Annex A.

However, it is not clear to \nwhat these references relate ; they do not appear to link the payments in the \nPayment Chain . \n \n(2) This e xcludes payments between the Bank’s Ukraine head office  and the \nBank’s Cyprus Branch  or PB Latvia (i.e. it excludes Prepayments, Returns of \nPrepayments and other payments between coun tries) . \n \n365  There are 924 payments in Annex A, in 66 Payment Chains. This excludes duplicate \nPayment Chains and payments between the Bank’s Ukraine head office and the \nBank’s Cyprus Branch or PB Latvia . We verified 806 of them to the Bank’s \ntransacti onal data. The difference of 118 is explained as follows:  \ni) 23 payments were made between customers of PB Latvia ; \nii) six payments were made between a customer of the Bank's Cyprus Branch and \nanother customer of PB Latvia ; \niii) three payments are apportioned between two Payment Chains;  \niv) 81 payments are repeated in an apparently related Payment Chain;  \nv) five payments are repeated in an apparently unrelated Payment Chain;  \nvi) we cannot identify two payments in the Bank’s transactional data; and  \nvii) on two occasions Annex A combines two payments into one.  \ni.e. 924 – 23 – 6 – 3 – 81 – 5 – 2 + 2 = 806.

I illustrate this by reference to six worked examples  (as set out \nin Appendices 5-6-1 to 5-6-6), whereby I compare what the Lafferty \nSpreadsheets indicate happened to the Relevant Drawdowns with what the \nBank’s transactional data  shows . Five of the six examples are the same  as \nthose described on the Bank’s case in paragraphs 3.36  to 3.139 . For \ncompleteness , in the remaining example ( i.e. Transmoloko) I address one of \nthe non -Relevant drawdowns in the Lafferty Spreadsheets.  \nConclusion  \n5.167  Owing to the findings set out above,  I do not consider that the First \nDefendant’s “Tracing Exercise” is accurate.  \n  \n \n366  Lafferty 2, paragraph 70.  \nD1/1/223\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 224 Is the First Defendant’s “Tracing Exercise” complete?  \nScope of Work  \n5.168  In order to assess the completeness of the First Defendant’s “Tracing \nExercise”:  \na) we determined whether the t ransactions in the Lafferty \nSpreadsheets  can be identified in the Bank’s transactional data;  \nb) we identified any other omissions; and  \nc) we reviewed  what the First Defendant  describes as “ wrongly \nincluded transactions ” in the Bank’s case.  \nSummary of findings  \n5.169  The First Defendant’s “Tracing Exercise”  contains a number of significant \nomissions. In 178 instances , the Payment Chain  is incomplete  (e.g. it is \nmissing a repayment  which , on the First Defendant’s case , would be the final \nstep ). In 10 instances,  in the absen ce of  additional information  the omissions \nare such that we cannot  corroborate the First Defendant’s case  by reference \nto the Bank’s transactional data , because  the funds cannot be followed with \nany certainty. In respect of  the latter, we woul d require additional \ninformation to verify that the funds repaid the loan  identified.

In five Payment \nChains, the Lafferty Spreadsheets do not identify the funds’ destination \nfollowing the Prepayment to PB Latvia  (i.e. Steps 3 and 4 are omitted).370 In \nthree of the five Payment Chains, we identified the funds which were  paid \nback from PB Latvia ; however, th ese funds d id not repay a loan. In the \nremaining two Payment Chains, we are unable  to identify the funds which \nwere  paid back from PB Latvia because we do not have  the relevant bank \nstatements.  \n5.175  In any event I note that , using  the Bank’s methodology , it is possible to \nmatch the Prepayment to PB Latvia to a Return of Prepayment \napproximately 90 days later under the same Supply Agreement reference . \n \n367  105 of the 178 Payment Chains contain Relevant Drawdowns, totalling  \nUSD 136,076,611.

Hence, the \npayments cannot be traced using Exact Matching.  Using an alternative \napproach  of selecting the next payments sequentially out of ZFZ’s account , \nthe destination of each of these payments was as follows (an extract of the \nBank’s transactional data is set out in Appendix 5-8-3): \na) the des tination of the payments to OGOK and Marganetskiy in 5.217  \na) and b) is unclear because the funds were paid on to other \ncustomers in several smaller payments;  \nb) Dniproazot converted UAH 5,560,416 to USD 467,688. It subsequently \nmade a repayment of USD 467,688 of loan 4D13217D; and  \nc) we are unable to verify the destination of th e payment to \nZaporozhyeoblenergo , because it was made to a third -party bank and \nwe do not have access to the relevant transactional data.  \n5.219  Using this approach , the remaining UAH  11,197, 231 is still matched  to the \nrepayments of ZFZ’s loans identified by the First Defendant in paragraph \n5.215 , but in a lower amount than allocated by the First Defendant .415 \n5.220  Hence , if the funds were traced by selecting the next payments  sequentially  \nout of ZFZ’s account , the result would be somewhat different.

The  First Defendant’s position \nappears to arise because  the Borrower  “either had no relevant prior \nborrowing, or all relevant borrowing had been paid out to other recipients \nand/or had been repaid .”429, 430  \n \n424  Lafferty 2, paragraphs 40 -45. \n425  Lafferty 2, paragraphs 48-50.4.  \n426  Lafferty 2, paragraphs 51 -52. \n427  Lafferty 2, paragraphs 46 -47.3.  \n428  Lafferty 2, paragraph 35 -38. \n429  Lafferty 2, paragraph 41.3.  \n430  As set out in Lafferty 2, Schedule 3 A. \nD1/1/260\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 261 5.232  However, a s set out at paragraph  5.3, the First Defendant does not take \naccount of Supply Agreement references in the transaction narrative  when \nmaking these assertions . By contrast, it is the Bank’s case that Relevant \nDrawdowns,  Prepayments and Returns of Prepayments are linked by the \nSupply Agreement  references . I have explained in Section 3 why I consider \nthe Bank’s case in this regard is accurate and complete.  \n5.233  The Prepayments referred to by the First Defendant as “ Non -Relevant  \nMoney ” are therefore an essential element  of the Bank ’s case  on how the \nUnreturned Prepayments were funded.

This \nrepaid the overdraft on the Defendant Supplier’s USD current \naccount, returning it to credit.  \n5.236  The Bank’s analysis links the Return of Prepayment to the Unre turned \nPrepayment (i.e. one funded  the other) . “Clearing ” does not undermine this \nanalysis ; indeed , it supports the fact that there were two debts which were \ntransactionally linked.  Therefore, the fact that two payments (i.e.  the Return \nof Prepayment and t he subsequent Unreturned Prepayment) were, as the \nFirst Defendant describes  it, “cleared” against one another  when neither \nparty had sufficient funds to make the payments, is entirely consistent with \nthe Bank’s analysis . \n5.237  Further, since  an FX Top -up was required to  fund  the Unreturned \nPrepayment , each Clearing Transaction led to  an additional cost  to the \nBorrower.  \n5.238  I set out an example of so -called Clearing Transactions below. A list of the \npayments is  set out in Appendix 5-9-1. \nExample of payments de scribed by the First Defendant as Clearing \nTransactions434 \n5.239  The Bank’s transactional data shows the following.  \n28 July 2014  \n5.240  At 14:37, Collyer made a payment of USD  30,000,000 from its USD current \naccount to Tekhspets.

Hence, he \nconsiders that the Bank  has \"double -counted\" the drawdown.  \n5.257  The First Defendant does not set out the Prepayments and Returns of \nPrepayment  which he believes  were  “double -counte d”. Instead, he \nstates:443 \n \"Given the complexity of this double -counting, and in particular \nthat the relevant chains which demonstrate it could be tens or even \nhundreds of transactions long, it has not been possible in the time \navailable comprehensively to identify all the double  counting , or \nproduce a fully-worked example .” \n5.258  In any event, I note that th e First Defendant  considers that all the so -called \n“double -counted” funds are also “Non -Relevant Money”.

However, there are also some \nsignificant differences. I set out below a generic example which compares \ntheir cases, accompanied by Figure 6-1 which depicts the similarities, and \nFigure 6-2 and Figure 6-3 which depict the differences. I then go on to \ncompare five of the  worked examples discussed in Sections 3 and 5.  \nThe starting point  \n6.2 At the outset, the Bank and the First Defendant agree that a  Borrower made \na Relevant Drawdown which funded a Prepayment to a Supplier. I depict this \nbelow.  \nFigure 6-1: Relevant Drawdowns which funded a Prepayment to a Supplier  \n \n6.3 The Bank’s case is that the initial Pr epayment was  made under one of the \nfollowing:  \na) a Relevant Supply Agreement. T his is where an Unreturned \nPrepayment was made to a Defendant Supplier (i.e. th e Supply \nAgreement was not referred to in relation to any subsequent Return \nof Prepayment );445 or \n \n445  Apart from partial Return s of Prepayments, as discussed in paragraphs 3.32  to 3.33 . \nD1/1/268\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 269 b) an O ther Supply Agreement. This is where the Prepayment was made \nto a Supplier, returned approximately 90 days later and funded  (or \npart ly funded ) a subsequent Prepayment ( see paragraph s 3.3d) and \ne)).446 For the purposes of this example, I refer to this agreement as \n“Ref. #1” (see further below).  \nWhere the initial Prepayment was made under a Relevant Supply Agreement  \n6.4 In respect of  the 54 Relevant Supply Agreements, in  12 instances447 the initial \nPrepayment was made under the Relevant Supply Agreement .448 The Bank’s \ncase is that this is an Unreturned Prepayment. The Bank’s analysis stops \nhere.  \n6.5 In these cases, the First Defendant agree s with the Bank that a Relevant \nDrawdown funded the Unreturned Prepayment. However, the First \nDefendant purports to “trace” the funds from the Defendant Supplier \nthrough a series of other payments , often on the same day, to either the \nsame Borrower, anothe r Borrower, or a “third  party ” borrower .449  \n \n446  As explained in paragraph 3.3e), in certain instances some of the funds from the \nReturn of Prepayment were used to make one or more loan repayments. This \ncreated a shortfall in the funds available to make the subsequent Prepayment. \nHence, we refer to the Return of Prepa yment as having “partly funded” the \nsubsequent Prepayment.  \n447  These are the 11 instances in which the cycle is marked as ‘0 days’ in Column J of \nAppendix  6-1, and the one instance highlighted in note 4 of Appendix 6 -1 (i.e. 11 + \n1 = 12). Appendix 6 -1 sets out an analysis of Prepayments, Returns of Prepayments \nand Unreturned Prepayments for each of the 54 Relevant Supply Agreements.  \n448  In the remaining 42 instances (i.e. 54 – 12 = 42), Prepayment(s) were made and \nreturned under Other Supply Agreement(s) prio r to the Unreturned Prepayment \nunder the Relevant Supply Agreement.  \n449  There are usually many intermediate steps in the First Defendant’s “ Tracing \nExercise ”, in addition to those depicted in Figure 6-2 and Figu"}

USD 15 million was directly  funded by \na Relevant Drawdown (i.e. the initial Prepayment was made under a Relevant \nSupply Agreement), and the remaining USD 15 million was funded by a Return of \nPrepayment (i.e. the initial Prepayme nt was made under an Other Supply \nAgreement). See Note 4 of Appendix 6 -1 and Appendix 3 -2-40-1. \n453  Column F of Appendix 6 -1 illustrates that there were between one and six \nPrepayments between the initial Prepayment and the final Unreturned Prepayment \nunder  each of the 54 Relevant Supply Agreements.  \n454  In 14 instances, the Prepayment was made under a Relevant Supply Agreement and \nwas therefore an Unreturned Prepayment.

These funds were at least part ly converted to UAH \nand back to USD  and were supplemented by a n FX Top -up.457 In 26 cases ,458 \nthe Borrower subsequent ly used these funds to make  an Unreturned \nPrepayment under a Relevant Supply Agreement  to a Defendant Supplier . \nFor the purposes of this example, I refer to this as agreement “Ref.  #3” ( i.e. \nthis Supply Agreement was not referred to in relation to any subs equent \nReturn of Prepayment ).459 \n \n455  Diagram at Lafferty 3, paragraph 47.  \n456  In column J of Appendix 6 -1, there are 26 instances in which the cycle is marked as \n‘180 days’ and 3 instances in which the cycle is marked as ‘270 days’ (i.e.  26 + 3 = \n29). \n457  Part of these funds were sometimes used to repay a loan (or loans) of the same \nBorrower. In these instances, the balance of the funds was used, togeth er with \nanother Relevant Drawdown, in order to make the Unreturned Prepayment.  \n458  See footnote 456. \n459  Apart from partial Return s of Prepayments, as discussed further in paragraphs 3.32  \nto 3.33 . \nD1/1/273\n24 November 2021  \nConfidential  \nFirst Report of Ian Thompson in BL -2017 -000665  | 274 6.12 By contrast, the First Defendant asserts that the Return of Prepayment \n(Ref.  #2) and the Unreturned Prepayment (Ref. #3) are  either : (i) Clearing \nTransactions ; or (ii) funded by Non-Relevant Money , which he therefore \ndisregards. Further , the First Defendant does not explain the FX Top -up. \n6.13 Figure 6-3 below compar es the Bank ’s and the First Defendant ’s cases  in the  \nround .

The remaining payments (totalling USD 653,166,000) took place between \nMay and July 2014. These payments were made from funds the Fourth Defendant \nreceived under Prepayments from the Borrowers.  \n486  USD 788,412,852  + USD 1,212,901,866  = USD 2,001,314,718 .
