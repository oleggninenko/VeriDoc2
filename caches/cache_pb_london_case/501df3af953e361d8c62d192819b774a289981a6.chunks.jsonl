This value was published on the \nOrielVIP online platform and valid in August 2016.

Using Mr Seymour’s costs the \nadjustment is as follows: $1,200,000 - $800,000 = \n$400,000 (PS1/10.12).  The resulting adjustment for \nthe 12-year check should be: $400,000/144*(144/2-\n15) = $158,333. The 6-year and 12-year checks are adjusted for \nindividually (PS1/10.12) Normally, PS would agree \nthat the 6 and 12 year checks would be coincident, \nthat is the 12 year should encompass the 6 year \ntasks. In this case PS  saw that the aircraft  (delivered \nin 2005) had a 6 year check in 2011 (as would be \nexpected) but had a 12 year prematurely in 2015 (at \nonly 10 years old) hence PS decided to split the \nvaluation of each check. It creates a difference in the \norder of 300KUSD increase to PS’s valuation if he \ncombines the two checks. Without knowing exactly \nwhich of the check work cards were accomplished or \ndeferred it makes the detailed analysis impossible to \nassess. Whilst PS agrees that normally the 6 and 12 \nyear checks would be combined, in this case believes \nthe separation is valid.  \n7.8  The Airbus’ \ntotal \nmaintenance \nadjustment \nvariance of \n$0.654m Ms Razzhivina calculated the total maintenance \nadjustment at $0.560m by (OR1/Table 8).
