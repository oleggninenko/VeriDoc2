MY INSTRUCTIONS\n The following expert reports on Ukrainian law have been produced for the purpose of the \ntrial of these proceedings: \n my eighth expert report dated 23 November 2021 (“ Beketov 8 ”), served by the Claimant \n(referred to in Beketov 8 as the Bank1); \n the expert report of Oleg Alyoshin dated  23 November 2021 (“ Alyoshin 1 ”), served by \nthe First Defendant; \n the expert report of Dmytro Marchukov dated 14 December 2021 (“ Marchukov 1 ”), \nserved by the Second Defendant;  \n the third expert report of Volodymyr Nahnybida dated 14 December 2021 (“ Nahnybida \n3”), served by the Third to Eighth Defendants; and \n the joint report dated 11 February 2022 (the “ Joint Report ” or “ JR”) signed by myself \nand the other experts named above. \n I have been instructed by the Bank’s solicitors, Hogan Lovells, to produce this supplemental \nreport to address the areas of disagreement between myself and the Defendants’ experts \nthat we have sought to identify and summarise briefly in the Joint Report. I do so by setting \nout, in relation to these areas of disagreement, evidence that (i) responds to the evidence \nof Mr Alyoshin, Mr Marchukov and/or Mr Nahnybida (as relevant), and (ii) supplements my \nevidence in Beketov 8 where I consider this would assist the court.  \n I should note that: \n I set out my evidence below under thirteen subject headings, labelled C to O, which \ncorrespond to the subject headings used in both Beketov 8 and the Joint Report; \n the sub-headings that I have used in each section (in bold) correspond to those used \nin the Joint Report; \n1  In this supplemental report, I adopt the defined terms that I used in Beketov 8.  \nC6/1/3\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 4 -  to aid readability, in places I have inserted additional sub-sub-headings (in underlined \nitalics); and   \n as in Beketov 8, all underlined emphasis appearing in translated quotations has been \nadded by me and, unless otherwise stated, does not appear in the original source. \n Where I do not specifically address a matter raised in the Joint Report and/or in Alyoshin 1, \nMarchukov 1 or Nahnybida 3, that should not be taken as indicating agreement with the \nother experts’ views on that matter. \n For the purposes of preparing this report, Hogan Lovells has provided me with the \ndocuments listed at Appendix I. \nB. CORRECTIONS \n In the course of preparing the Joint Report and this report, I have identified the following \nerrata in Beketov 8 that I would like to correct as follows: \n at Beketov 8/214, I stated:  \n“If a loan required by the Bank’s internal policies to be approved by the Bank’s \nSupervisory Board was instead approved by a credit committee or other body of the \nBank, the members of the Supervisory Board would be in breach of Article 51(4) and \nArticle 63(1) of the JSC Law, provided that they do not have a defence of absence of \nfault … ”.\nThis "}
{"start": 3500, "text": "eport and this report, I have identified the following \nerrata in Beketov 8 that I would like to correct as follows: \n at Beketov 8/214, I stated:  \n“If a loan required by the Bank’s internal policies to be approved by the Bank’s \nSupervisory Board was instead approved by a credit committee or other body of the \nBank, the members of the Supervisory Board would be in breach of Article 51(4) and \nArticle 63(1) of the JSC Law, provided that they do not have a defence of absence of \nfault … ”.\nThis wording suggests that if absence of fault were to be established, this would cure \nthe defendant’s breach of the duties imposed by Articles 51(4) and 63(1) of the JSC \nLaw. That is not correct. Absence of fault would not cure the breach of duty itself; it \nwould instead prevent the defendant from being held liable in tort under Article 1166 for \nany harm caused by that breach of duty, because the element of fault required under \nArticle 1166 would not be satisfied. A more accurate statement would be to change the \nwords “ provided that they do not have a defence of absence of fault ” in the passage \nquoted above to read “ although, it would be a defence to any claim under Article 1166 \nin respect of such breach for the members to show absence of fault … ”;  \n at Beketov 8/388, I stated that the fine that the NBU may impose upon a bank for inter \nalia failing to comply with a curator’s requests varied from between 0.01% and 1% of \nC6/1/4\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 5 - the bank’s registered authorised capital. In fact, the correct range (as identified in \nfootnote 154 to paragraph 388) is 0.05% to 0.1%;  \n at Beketov 8/117, 268 and 269, I used the term “Supply Agreements” when I should \nhave instead used the term “Relevant Supply Agreements”; \n at Beketov 8/358(c), “24 April 1999” should read “24 March 1999”; \n at Beketov 8/386, “paragraph 5.5” should read “paragraph 5.6”;  \n at Beketov 8/474, “Code of Administrative Justice” should read “Code of Administrative \nProcedure”; and \n at Beketov 8/480, the first quotation is from Article 2.4 of the 2017 Charters, not Article \n2.3 as stated, and the second quotation is from Article 3. \nC. THE UKRAINIAN LEGAL SYSTEM \n The experts largely reached a consensus on the subject of the Ukrainian legal system (see \nJR/1,32). We disagree on only the following two issues. \nRelationship between the Civil and Commercial Codes \n First, Mr Alyoshin and I disagree as to how a conflict between the Commercial Code, which \ngoverns relationships between legal entities, and the Civil Code, which governs relationships \nbetween individuals and entities in general, would be resolved by the Ukrainian courts \n(JR/2).  \n Mr Alyoshin states at Alyoshin 1/54 that because the Commercial Code is lex specialis in \nrelation to the Civil Code, provisions of the former will have priority in the event of conflict \nbetween the two. Whilst I agree that the Commercial Code generally is more specialised \nthan the Civil Code, and that, under Ukrainian law, a particular rule that is considered to be \nlex specialis  generally will be applied in priority to a particular rule that is considered to be \nlex generalis  in the event of conflict between the two, this is not a definitive consideration in \nthis particular case and the approach is in fact more nuanced. \n2  Throughout this report, references in this form indicate the relevant paragraph number(s) of the report to \nwhich I refer. Here, for example, “JR/1,3” refers to paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Joint Report. \nC6/1/5\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 6 -  Mr Alyoshin’s view is contradicted by Article 4(2) of the Civil Code (“ Article 4(2) ”) as well as \nby recent court practice of the Supreme Court, both of which emphasise the primacy of the \nCivil Code as the main act of civil legislation in Ukraine.

Article 4(2) provides: \n“2. The Civil Code of Ukraine is the main act of the civil legislation of Ukraine. \nThe other laws approved according to the Constitution of Ukraine and this Code shall also \nrepresent the acts of the civil legislation (hereinafter – the “law”). \nIf a legislative initiative subject presents to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine [i.e. Parliament] \na draft law, which regulates civil relations otherwise than provided by this Code, it shall be \nobliged to present concurrently the draft law on the introduction of amendments to the Civil \nCode of Ukraine… ”.\n In its Resolution dated 22 June 2021 in case No. 334/3161/17, the Grand Chamber of the \nSupreme Court said in relation to Article 4(2): \n“17. Thus, the indication in the Civil Code of Ukraine of the need to adopt other laws in \naccordance with this Code is sufficient grounds to believe that a norm of the Civil Code of \nUkraine prevails over another normative legal act having legal force of law of Ukraine with \nthe same subject matter [as the Civil Code].  \n18. Special provisions of the law may contain clarifying provisions, but may not directly \ncontradict the provisions of the Civil Code of Ukraine ”. \n The High Commercial Court of Ukraine referred to Article 4(2) as follows in its Letter dated \n7 April 2008, No. 01-8/211 “On some issues of the practice of applying the provisions of the \nCivil and Commercial Codes of Ukraine”: \n“in accordance with Article 4(2) of the Civil Code of Ukraine, the main act of civil legislation \nof Ukraine is the Civil Code of Ukraine. Therefore, if the provisions of the Commercial Code \nof Ukraine do not contain specifics for regulating property relations of business entities, but \nestablish general rules that are inconsistent with the relevant rules of the Civil Code of \nUkraine, the rules established by the Civil Code of Ukraine should be applied ”. \n The Letter provided the following example:\n“…Article 207 of the Commercial Code of Ukraine does not contain specifics for regulating \ncommercial relations, but contains general rules on invalidation of commercial obligations, \nwhich contradict the Civil Code of Ukraine both in terms of terminology and content. \nTherefore, Article 207 of the Commercial Code of Ukraine, in accordance with Article 4(2)(1) \nC6/1/6\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 7 - of the Civil Code of Ukraine, cannot be applied ”3.\n Although the above Letter dates from 2008, I do not consider the guidance it contains to be \noutdated, as the very same approach for resolving conflict between provisions of the Civil \nCode and Commercial Code is reflected in more recent court practice of the Supreme Court. \nFor example, in its Resolution dated 1 August 2019 in case No. 911/1205/18, the Supreme \nCourt held:\n“71. In other words, the Commercial Code of Ukraine in relation to the Civil Code of Ukraine \nis a systematised legislative act that regulates the specifics of commercial relations. \n72. Therefore, the special rules of the Commercial Code of Ukraine, which establish the \nspecifics for regulating the property relations of business entities, are subject to priority \napplication over those rules of the Civil Code of Ukraine that contain the corresponding \ngeneral regulation. The exception is situations when the provisions of the Commercial Code \nof Ukraine do not contain specifics for regulating the property relations of business entities, \nbut establish general rules that are inconsistent with the relevant rules of the Civil Code of \nUkraine. Then the rules established by the Civil Code of Ukraine should be applied ”4.\nJudicial decisions "}

Then the rules established by the Civil Code of Ukraine should be applied ”4.\nJudicial decisions \n Secondly, whilst the experts agree that Ukrainian courts do not apply the doctrine of stare \ndecisis  (JR/3.5), we disagree as to the extent to which rulings of a higher court will \nnevertheless bind the lower courts (JR/4).  \n Whereas I acknowledge that Supreme Court resolutions (and to a lesser degree, decisions \nof the intermediate appellate courts), whilst technically not binding on lower courts, are \nnevertheless generally followed as a matter of practice, leading me to describe them as \nhaving “ persuasive authority ”, Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida believe that the practical \ntreatment of Supreme Court resolutions is such that they describe them as “ binding ” and \nstate that a failure to follow them “ will” result in a lower court’s decision being set aside on \nappeal (JR/4.2).  \n3  Article 207 was subsequently excluded from the Commercial Code by Law No. 2275-VIII of 6 February \n2018. \n4  See also, for example, the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 18 August 2021, case No. 654/241/19, \nconcerning a conflict between the provisions of the Civil Code and the Family Code: “ the norm of the Civil \nCode of Ukraine prevails over the single-subject norm of another normative legal act, which has the legal \nforce of the law of Ukraine. Special norms of the law may contain clarifying provisions, but may not directly \ncontradict the provisions of the Civil Code of Ukraine ”. \nC6/1/7\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 8 -  I disagree. The law does not oblige lower courts when considering a case to follow the \nconclusions set forth in prior resolutions of the Supreme Court in cases with similar facts; \nrather, it expressly requires only that such conclusions be taken into account. \n My view is supported by the following provisions of law: \n Article 6(1) of the Ukrainian Law “On the Judiciary and the Status of Judges” provides: \n“1. When administering justice, courts shall be independent of any illegal influence. \nCourts shall administer justice on the basis of the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine \nand governed by the rule of law ”. No reference is made to prior court rulings; \n Article 13(6) of the Ukrainian Law “On the Judiciary and the Status of Judges” provides: \n“6. Conclusions on the application of legal norms set forth in rulings of the Supreme \nCourt shall be taken into account by other courts when applying such legal norms ”;  \n the same provisions are also contained in the Code of Commercial Procedure: \n“Article 11. Rule of law and sources of law applied by the court \n2. The court shall consider cases in accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine, laws \nof Ukraine, international treaties that the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine agrees are \nbinding5. … \nArticle 236. Legality and validity of the judgment \n4. In choosing and applying the rule of law to the disputed legal relationship, the court \nshall take into account the conclusions on the application of the rules of law set out in \nthe resolutions of the Supreme Court ”6; and\n Article 287 of the Code of Commercial Procedure sets out the grounds upon which a \ncassation appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court: \n2. The grounds for cassation appeal of the court judgments referred to in Paragraphs \n1, 4, Part 1 of this Article shall be the incorrect application by the court of substantive \nlaw or violation of procedural law only in the following cases: \n1) if the court of appeal in the appealed judgment has applied the rule of law without \ntaking into account the"}
{"start": 14000, "text": "”6; and\n Article 287 of the Code of Commercial Procedure sets out the grounds upon which a \ncassation appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court: \n2.

It is only if the lower court failed to take \ninto account such prior Supreme Court decision(s) that a cassation appeal can be brought \non this ground. \nD. VOID AND VOIDABLE TRANSACTIONS \n The experts’ points of agreement on this subject are set out at JR/5, 11, 13, 15, 18 and 20. \nI address our points of disagreement below. \nGeneral \nStanding to challenge the validity of a transaction \n At JR/6, Mr Alyoshin and I disagree as to the interest that a person other than a party to a \ntransaction must have in order to have standing to allege in court that the transaction is \ninvalid. I consider that any third party with its own interest (i.e. in whether or not the \ntransaction is valid) can bring such a claim, whereas Mr Alyoshin says that only third parties \nwith a “ protected legal interest ” can do so. \n I believe this disagreement to be immaterial to these proceedings, as the Defendants do not \nappear to challenge the Bank’s right to allege the existence of circumstances evidencing the \n7  Resolution of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court dated 19 May 2020, case No. 910/719/19, defined \n“a court judgment in similar legal relations is such judgment where there are similar subject matter of the \ndispute, grounds for claim, content of the claims and factual circumstances established by the court, and \nthere is identical substantive and legal regulations of the disputed legal relations ”. \nC6/1/9\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 10 - nullity (i.e. voidness) of certain transactions (principally, the Relevant Loans, Intermediary \nLoans, New Loans, Supply Agreements and Agency Agreements).  \n Nevertheless, I do not consider Mr Alyoshin’s view to be correct. In support of my view I \nwould note that although the Civil Code does not define the term ‘interested party’, the \nSupreme Court8 has followed the prior practice of the High Commercial Court of Ukraine in \nholding that the persons who qualify as interested parties with standing to allege that a \nparticular transaction is invalid (other than the contractual counterparties) fall to be \ndetermined by the court having regar"}
{"start": 17500, "text": "ments).  \n Nevertheless, I do not consider Mr Alyoshin’s view to be correct. In support of my view I \nwould note that although the Civil Code does not define the term ‘interested party’, the \nSupreme Court8 has followed the prior practice of the High Commercial Court of Ukraine in \nholding that the persons who qualify as interested parties with standing to allege that a \nparticular transaction is invalid (other than the contractual counterparties) fall to be \ndetermined by the court having regard to the particular facts and legal rules applicable to \nthe relationship in question9. Since each person is entitled to apply to court seeking \nprotection of one’s rights or legal interests (Article 16(1) of the Civil Code), in my view a \nperson whose rights or legal interests may be adversely affected by a transaction will \nnormally have standing to allege its invalidity under Article 215 of the Civil Code. This is \nwhat I mean when I refer to ‘a party with its own interest’ in whether or not the transaction is \nvalid. \n Mr Alyoshin has not offered any explanation in Alyoshin 1 or the Joint Report as to what he \nmeans by “ another party with a protected legal interest ” and how that differs to what I have \ndescribed above. I am not aware of the term ‘protected legal interest’ having any particular \nmeaning that is recognised in Ukrainian law in the context of determining who has standing \nto allege that a particular transaction is invalid.  \nThe presumption of validity under Article 204 of the Civil Code (“ Article 204 ”) \n At JR/5.9, the experts agree that transactions are presumed to be valid in accordance with \nArticle 204, which states that a “ transaction is lawful unless its invalidity is directly \nestablished by law or is declared invalid by a court ”, and that (where the presumption \napplies) doubts regarding the validity and enforceability of a transaction should be resolved \nin favour of it being valid.  \n But, at JR/7, we disagree as to whether this presumption applies in cases where transactions \nare alleged to be void rather than voidable. I say it does not, Mr Alyoshin (with whom Mr \nNahnybida agrees) says it does. \n8  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 15 October 2019, case No. 907/721/18. \n9  Information Letter of the High Commercial Court of Ukraine dated 7 April 2008, no. 01-8/211, paragraph \n18.  \nC6/1/10\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 11 -  My view is supported by the wording of Article 204 quoted above, which makes clear that \nthe presumption does not apply in the case of transactions whose invalidity is directly \nestablished by law, i.e. void transactions. Recent court practice supports this conclusion: \n in its Resolution dated 23 January 2019 in case No. 355/385/17, Person 2 v. Arsenal \nInsurance Company ,the Supreme Court said: “… Article 204 of the Civil Code of \nUkraine enshrines the presumption of legality of a transaction. This presumption means \nthat a transaction is considered lawful, ie that it gives rise to, alters or terminates civil \nrights and obligations until this presumption is rebutted, including by a court decision \nthat has entered into force ”. The Supreme Court has also made clear that a void \ntransaction does not (and cannot) alter legal rights or obligations: “ A transaction, the \ninvalidity of which is not established by law (a voidable transaction) gives rise to legal \nconsequences (acquisition, change or termination of rights and obligations) at which it \nhas been directed until it is declared invalid by a court decision. … A void transaction, \nin contrast to the voidable one, does not create legal consequences, i.e., does not “give \nrise to” (change or terminate) civil rights and obligations ”10, from which it follows that \nthe presumption of validity does not apply to void transactions; \n in its Resolution dated 30 September 2021 in case No. 483/1056/20, Person 1 v. Agro \nKON LLC , the Mykolaiv Court of Appeal stated that “ according to the content of this "}
{"start": 21000, "text": "cted until it is declared invalid by a court decision. … A void transaction, \nin contrast to the voidable one, does not create legal consequences, i.e., does not “give \nrise to” (change or terminate) civil rights and obligations ”10, from which it follows that \nthe presumption of validity does not apply to void transactions; \n in its Resolution dated 30 September 2021 in case No. 483/1056/20, Person 1 v. Agro \nKON LLC , the Mykolaiv Court of Appeal stated that “ according to the content of this \npresumption, its rule applies to the concluded transactions that do not contain signs of \nvoidness ”; and \n in its Resolution dated 15 December 2021 in case No. 757/51379/17, Person 1 v. \nPersons 2 and 3 , the Supreme Court stated that “ denying the presumption of validity of \nthe transaction occurs when: invalidity of the transaction is directly established by law \n(i.e., its voidness takes place); if it is declared invalid by the court, i.e., there is a court \ndecision that has entered into legal force (i.e., the disputed transaction has been \ndeclared invalid by the court) ”. In my view, this means that the presumption is denied \n(i.e.does not fall to be applied by the courts) (i) in the case of transactions the invalidity \nof which is established by law (void transactions), and (ii) once a voidable transaction \nis declared invalid by an effective court decision. \n10  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 27 October 2021, case No. 346/6034/13-ts. \nC6/1/11\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 12 -  In support of their contrary view: \n Mr Alyoshin cites the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 10 March 2021 in case \nNo. 607/11746/17 (see Alyoshin 1/77). This case is irrelevant, however, as it concerned \na contractual dispute in which the claimant did not seek to invalidate the forwarding \nagreement in question, or claim that it was void ab initio, and instead merely sought to \nrecover funds paid to the defendant agent under the relevant forwarding agreement. \nUnsurprisingly in these circumstances, the Resolution says nothing about the \napplication of the presumption of validity under Article 204 of the Civil Code to either \nvoid or voidable transactions; and \n Mr Nahnybida cites the Resolutions of the Supreme Court in cases No. 643/17966/14-\nts; No. 520/6819/14-ts; No. 554/5323/14; No. 242/5668/18-ts; and No. 225/6667/16-ts \n(see Nahnybida 3/204), but in none of these cases did the Supreme Court consider \nwhether the agreements at issue in each case were void, and the cases are therefore \nirrelevant. Although each of these Resolutions states that if the presumption of validity \n“is not denied ”, then all the rights and obligations created by the transaction shall be \nenforceable, as I have explained above the presumption is denied (i.e. it is not applied \nby the courts) where a transaction’s invalidity is established by law.  \n For the avoidance of doubt, I acknowledge that (as stated at JR/8.2) where there is a litigated \ndispute between the parties to a transaction as to whether their transaction is void, the role \nof the court is to investigate and establish the relevant facts and law and confirm which of \nthe parties’ positions (as to whether the transaction is void) is correct. But during this \nprocess, the presumption under Article 204 will not apply and the court should not lean in \nfavour of upholding the transaction. \n In my view, the rationale underlying this position under Ukrainian law is that whilst it makes \nsense to apply a rule favouring the upholding of transactions by the courts in circumstances \nwhere a court has a discretion whether or not to declare a transaction invalid (as is the case \nwith voidable transactions), it does not make sense to apply such a rule in circumstances \nwhere no such discretion exists (as with transactions that are void on the grounds alleged \nby the Bank in these proceedings) and the issue is simply whether or not circumstances \nexist that give rise to voidness as a mat"}

In this case, such \ntransaction is not required to be held invalid by court ”. \n Indeed, the Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that a claimant seeking to have an \nallegedly void transaction declared invalid by a court is pursuing an inappropriate means of \nprotecting its rights and interests. For example, in its Resolution dated 4 June 2019 in case \nNo. 916/3156/17, PJSC Imexbank v. Avensis LLC ,the Grand Chamber of the Supreme \nCourt stated at paragraph 70 that, “ such remedy as a declaration of the voidness of a \ntransaction is not a remedy foreseen by law ”, and at paragraph 74, “ declaring a transaction \ninvalid applies [only] to voidable transactions ”. The Grand Chamber went on to conclude: \n“86. Consequently, PJSC Imexbank’s claim for recognition as invalid of the void agreement \ncannot be satisfied, as the claimant requested an inappropriate method of protection. \nTherefore, the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court does not examine the arguments of \nthe parties regarding the voidness of the disputed agreement, does not confirm or refute it, \nas the relevant analysis must be made in the motivating part of the judgment in case the \nclaimant applies to court for application of an appropriate method of protection. … \nConclusions on the application of the law \n94. Recognition of a void transaction as invalid at the request of its party is not an appropriate \nway to protect the rights, as it will not lead to a real restoration of the violated rights of the \nclaimant, because a void transaction is invalid by operation of law. \n95. If there is a dispute over the legal consequences of an invalid transaction, that one of \nthe parties to it or another interested person considers to be void, the court examines the \nrelevant arguments and in the reasoning part of the judgment, by applying the relevant \nprovisions of substantive law, confirms or denies the invalidity of the transaction ”11.  \n In a more recent example, in its Resolution dated 27 October 2021 in case No. \n757/13700/15-ts, Person 1 v. Person 2, Toloka Publishing House LLC, private notary \nPerevertun O.

Person 1 also \nsought to reclaim ownership of the property transferred to Person 2 under the allegedly void \nagreement from its current owner, Toloka Publishing LLC. The Supreme Court dismissed \nthat part of the claim by which Person 1 sought a declaration that the agreement was void, \nstating: \n“In Resolutions of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court dated 10 April 2019 in case \nNo. 463/5896/14-ts (proceedings No. 14-90tss19) and dated 4 June 2019 in case No. \n916/3156/17 (proceedings No. 12-304gs18) there is a conclusion that if a transaction is \ninvalid by operation of law, invalidation of such transaction by the court is not required; \ndeclaring a void transaction invalid is not provided by law, as the void transaction is invalid \nby operation of law. Therefore, such legal remedy as declaring a void transaction invalid is \nnot an appropriate way to protect rights and interests provided for by law. \nIn addition, such legal remedy as establishing the voidness of transaction is also an \ninappropriate way to protect rights and interests provided for by law. \nIf there is a dispute over the legal consequences of an invalid transaction, that one of the \nparties to it or another interested person considers to be void, the court examines the \nrelevant arguments and in the reasoning part of the judgment, by applying the relevant \nprovisions of substantive law, confirms or denies the invalidity of the transaction. \n… \nThe court of first instance, the conclusion of which the court of appeal agreed with, \nestablished the fact of concluding a disputed transaction by forging documents, by virtue \nwhereof came to the conclusion that it [the transaction] was aimed at the unlawful \nacquisition of the property of an individual, therefore it is void, since it violates public policy. \nTherefore, in view of the foregoing, declaring the disputed transaction void is not an \nappropriate way to protect the rights, as a void transaction is invalid by operation of law. \nThus, the courts of previous instances erroneously concluded that there were legal grounds \nto satisfy the claim in this part ”12.\n The Supreme Court’s conclusions above are in alignment with my statements at JR/8.1 and \n8.2. \n Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida’s contrary view is that where a dispute exists as to whether \na transaction is void, the voidness of that transaction must be “ established ” by the court \n(JR/8.3). But this confuses an order declaring invalidity (i.e. invalidating a transaction) with \n12  The same has been reiterated by the Supreme Court in, for example, its Resolutions dated 6 July 2022, \ncase No. 681/196/20, and 1 August 2022, case No. 466/5969/20.\nC6/1/14\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 15 - a finding that a transaction is void as a matter of law.

Mr Alyoshin’s first authority is Resolution No. 9 of the Plenum of the  \nSupreme Court of Ukraine dated 6 November 2009, entitled “On the Court Practice of \nHearing Civil Cases Regarding Invalidation of Transactions”, but this is an outdated \nResolution that has been overtaken by court practice of the (new) Supreme Court as set out \nabove, which confirms that the courts should not entertain claims seeking to declare a void \ntransaction to be invalid, as that is not an appropriate rem"}

Claimants 1 and 2 filed a \nclaim to invalidate the results of the auction and the assignment agreement concluded with \nDefendant 2. The Supreme Court upheld the claim, finding that there was no basis to \nconclude that the earlier assignment agreements between the bank and the claimants were \nvoid. I consider the case to be irrelevant, therefore, as it did not concern any void \ntransactions. \n At Alyoshin 1/footnote 22, Mr Alyoshin says that in this case the Supreme Court held that \n“the bank could not treat the loans as void without obtaining a court decision to that effect ”. \nI do not believe this statement accurately represents the Supreme Court’s actual ruling, \n13  For the avoidance of doubt, the Ukrainian courts do have the power to make ‘pure’ declarations, i.e. without \nany associated award of tangible relief. See Article 16(2) of the Civil Code, stating that available remedies \nin respect of violated civil right and interests can include declarations of right, declarations of invalidity of \ntransactions and declarations that actions or omissions of the state, local authority, or their officers or \nemployees were illegal. However, as I have explained above, Ukrainian court practice is clear that the \npower to declare a transaction invalid only applies to voidable (and not void) transactions. \n14  I note that Mr Nahnybida makes a point of referring to this Resolution as “ the November Resolution ”, rather \nthan ‘the November 2009 Resolution’, which would be more informative. See Nahnybida 3/217. \nC6/1/15\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 16 - which did not suggest that a court decision is required in order for a void transaction to be \nvoid. Instead, as shown in the extract below, the Supreme Court noted that:  \n the DGF’s determination that the assignment agreements were void could not have the \neffect of making them so; and \n nor could the DGF’s determination serve as a basis for applying the consequences of \nnullity to the earlier assignment agreements, such as the bank recovering from the \nclaimants the rights that had been transferred to them thereunder: \n“The relevant transaction is void not by the decision of the authorized person of the \nFund, but in accordance with the law. … The consequences of the nullity of the \ntransaction also occur for the parties due to the requirements of the law. The decision \nof the authorised person of the Fund is not a ground for applying such consequences. \n… \nIn accordance with Part 4 of Art. 38 of [the DGF Law]15 during the interim administration, \nas well as during liquidation, the Fund notifies the parties to the agreements specified \nin part two of Article 38 of this Law, about the nullity of these agreements and takes \naction to apply the consequences of the nullity of the agreements; takes measures to \nrecover (return) the property (funds) of the bank transferred under "}

This rule does not \ncontradict my view as set out above – the fact that a court order may be required in order to \n15  Article 38 of the DGF Law (“ Article 38 ”) is entitled “ Measures ensuring the preservation of bank assets \nand preventing bank property losses and damages ”. When a bank is in a temporary administration or \nliquidation procedure, Part 2 of Article 38 requires the DGF to identify those transactions entered into by \nthe bank during a specified time period that are void on any of the grounds listed in Part 3 of Article 38. \nPart 4 requires the DGF to notify the parties to all such void transactions that they are void and to take \nsteps to apply the consequences of such nullity, such as reclaiming the bank’s property transferred under \nsuch transactions.  \nC6/1/16\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 17 - grant relief that gives effect to certain consequences of a transaction being void does not \nmean that a court order is required to establish that a transaction is void per se .  \n Further in this regard, I should make clear that the Bank’s Ukrainian law claims in these \nproceedings do not include a request that the court order the payment of restitution or \ncompensation as a consequence of a transaction being void. The Bank instead brings (i) a \nclaim in tort under Article 1166 (and 1190), and (ii) a claim in unjust enrichment under \nArticle 1212 (which is not the same as a claim seeking restitution of property passing under \na void transaction pursuant to Article 216 of the Civil Code).  \nConfirming that a transaction is void in the absence of one of the parties to the transaction \n The next point of disagreement (at JR/9) between the experts is whether a court can \n‘confirm’ (on my view, as explained above) or ‘establish’ (on Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida’s \nview, as also explained above) that a transaction is void in the absence of one or more of \nthe parties to that transaction. My view is that it can do so (i.e. a claimant can allege facts \nand matters giving rise to the voidness of a transaction under the Civil Code, and the court \ncan confirm the transaction is void, without all the parties to that transaction being before \nthe court), whereas Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida say it cannot.  \n This issue is said to be relevant to these proceedings because inter alia the Bank alleges \nthat the Relevant Loans and Relevant Supply Agreements are void, but it has not named as \ndefendants the 50 Borrowers that entered into those agreements with, respectively, the \nBank and the Defendant Suppliers (although I note that all such Borrowers are alle"}

In addressing this issue, I do not express any view as to whether this issue is \nin fact an English law question (on the basis that English law is the procedural law of these \nproceedings) and I confine myself to explaining the position under Ukrainian law, which I \nnote treats this issue as a question of procedure, not substance (specifically, the rules \ngoverning who may act as a “ trial participant ”, including the rules governing joinder of \ninterested third parties, are set out in Ukraine’s procedural Codes16).  \n16  For example, both the Code of Civil Procedure and Code of Commercial Procedure contain a separate \nChapter 4 regarding “ trial participants ”, containing rules for determining the parties to a case and their \nrights and obligations, including rules regarding the joinder of co-claimants, co-defendants and interested \nthird parties. \nC6/1/17\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 18 -  Firstly, I would note that where a claimant seeks to have the court apply the consequences \nof invalidity against a counterparty to a void transaction, for example by giving restitution of \nproperty passing thereunder (under Article 216 of the Civil Code), then I would consider the \ncounterparty to be a necessary party to the claim. In the present proceedings, however, the \nBank’s claims are in tort and unjust enrichment, and, as I have said above, the Bank does \nnot seek to apply the consequences of invalidity against the Borrowers in relation to any \ntransactions that it alleges are void. I do not, therefore, consider the Borrowers to be \nnecessary defendants to either the Bank’s tort or unjust enrichment claims as a matter of \nUkrainian procedural law.  \n Secondly, as I explained at Beketov 8/271, under Ukrainian rules of procedure, where a \ndecision in a case may have an effect on the rights and obligations of third parties, such \npersons may be named as third parties to the proceedings by one of the litigants or by the \ncourt. Moreover, as I explain at paragraph 58 below, findings of fact in a judgment will not \nhave any preclusive effect for non-parties to those proceedings. I believe these procedural \nfeatures of Ukrainian law may help to explain why, in my experience, the parties to a \nproceeding in which a transaction is alleged to be void will often name all the counterparties \nto that transaction as third parties to the proceedings.  \n Thirdly, I note that Article 216(4) of the Civil Code provides that the legal consequences of \nthe invalidity of a void transaction cannot be changed by agreement of the parties17. The \nsame is not true of voidable transactions, so for example if a court decides to invalidate a \nvoidable transaction and orders one party to return property passing under that transaction \nto the other party, those parties can agree between themselves that such restitution is not \nrequired. But, where a transaction is void, and a court orders restitution as a consequence \nof such nullity, by law the parties cannot agree between themselves that such restitution \nneed not be given. In my view, this is a further reason in support of my position that Ukrainian \nlaw does not require the counterparties to a void transaction to be before the court in any \nproceeding in which voidness is alleged.  \n17  See for example the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 23 January 2019 in case No. 355/385/17 \n(referre"}

By \nagreement of the parties, only the legal consequences of the voidable transaction may be changed ”.\nC6/1/18\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 19 -  Mr Alyoshin cites three authorities in support of his contrary view (at Alyoshin 1/78), but I do \nnot believe any of them assist him as they all concern voidable, rather than void, \ntransactions:  \n in the Resolution of the Plenum of the Supreme Court of Ukraine dated 6 November \n2009 (which as noted at paragraph 37 above is an outdated authority contradicted by \ncourt practice of the new Supreme Court), the Supreme Court of Ukraine’s guidance \nstated that “ persons participating in a case on declaring the transaction invalid are \nprimarily the parties to the transaction ”. But this guidance can have no application to \nvoid transactions, which as I have explained cannot be declared invalid; \n the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 30 July 2020 in case No. 670/23/18 \nconcerned a claim by Horizont PE to invalidate an assignment agreement concluded \nbetween Financial company “Central Finance” and Person 1. The Supreme Court \nreversed the appellate court’s ruling satisfying the claim, on the grounds that Financial \ncompany “Central Finance” – a party to the disputed agreement – was not involved in \nthe proceedings as a defendant, but merely as a third party. But again this was a claim \nseeking to have a voidable transaction invalidated18 and so the Resolution has no \nrelevance to void transactions; and \n the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 27 January 2021 in case No. 404/1853/17 \nconcerned a mortgage agreement between VAB Bank and Person 2. Person 1, who \nco-owned the mortgaged property but was not party to the mortgage agreement, \nbrought a claim simultaneously seeking to invalidate the agreement and to declare it \nvoid on grounds that he had not consented to it. The Supreme Court rejected the claim \nbecause Person 2 had not been added as a party to the proceedings. However, in its \nResolution the Supreme Court reiterated that a void transaction cannot be declared \nvoid and set out the circumstances necessary in order to declare a voidable transaction \ninvalid (referring to Articles 16, 203 and 215 of the Civil Code19). I consider, therefore, \nthat on a proper analysis of the Resolution it is apparent that the Supreme Court (i) \nrejected Person 1’s request to declare the mortgage void on grounds that such legal \n18  The claimant alleged invalidity with reference to Articles 203, 215, 512-519, 528, 556, 1054, 1077, 1079, \n1082, 1084 of the Civil Code, as well as Article 24 of the Mortgage Law and Article 2 of the Law on Banks, \nwhich contain general provisions compliance with which is necessary for a transaction to be valid.

Accordingly, Mr Alyoshin’s statement at Alyoshin 1/78 that \nin this case the Supreme Court “ dismissed a claim for a declaration that a mortgage \nagreement was void on the basis that the mortgagor had not been named as a \ndefendant to the claim ” is incorrect, in that Mr Alyoshin refers to only one of the two \nbases on which the Supreme Court rejected the claim. \n I also note that none of the above authorities considered a situation in which claims in tort \nand/or unjust enrichment were brought in circumstances involving allegedly invalid \ntransactions (as opposed to claims seeking to have the court apply the consequences of \ninvalidity against a counterparty to an invalid transaction). \n At Nahnybida 3/217, Mr Nahnybida refers to and relies upon several authorities in addition \nto those relied upon by Mr Alyoshin. But those authorities also do not support their view: \n in the extract from the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 8 September 2021 in \ncase No. 569/3201/20 quoted by Mr Nahnybida, he highlights language by which the \nSupreme Court stated that “ legal consequences of performance of an invalid20\ntransaction primarily affect the rights and interests of persons that are parties to such \nan agreement . Thus, when resolving disputes to establish the invalidity of a transaction, \ncourts must verify the composition of the participants in the process and ascertain the \ncircle of persons that are subject to the consequences of the invalidity of the concluded \ntransaction ”. Again, this case concerned a claim to have a voidable transaction \ninvalidated (as allegedly breaching Article 583(2) of the Civil Code and Article 5 of the \nMortgage Law21), and it does not apply to void transactions;  \n the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 31 August 2021 in case No. 909/207/20 \nconcerned a case in which the claimant sought to invalidate a sale and purchase \nagreement between the Ivano-Frankivsk Valve Plant PJSC and Person 1 due to the \nlack of authority of the deputy chairman of the managing board of Ivano-Frankivsk Valve \n20  Mr Nahnybida erroneously translates the term “ nedіysnyi pravochin” that appears in the original judgment \nas “a void transaction ” (see Nahnybida 3/217). The correct translation is “ an invalid transaction ”.  \n21  That the claimant alleged breaches of these particular Articles is apparent from the Resolution of the \nRivnenskyi Court of Appeal dated 25 March 2021, case No. 569/3201/20. \nC6/1/20\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 21 - Plant PJSC to conclude such agreements22. Mr Nahnybida highlights language by \nwhich the Supreme Court stated that “ the panel of judges draws attention to the fact \nthat the parties to the case of invalidation are, first of all, the parties to the transaction. \nIn particular, in a case regarding a claim of an interested person to invalidate a contract \nall parties of the transaction should be involved as defendants ; therefore, the parties of \nthe disputed contract are the proper defendants, but not just one of them ”. But again, \nthis statement concerns voidable, rather than void, transactions (and the same is true \nof the authorities Mr Nahnybida refers to in footnote 150 as stating the same \nconclusion); and\n the Resolution of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court dated 17 April 2018 in case \nNo. 523/9076/16-ts concerned a claim to declare the actions of the founders of Norma \nPlus LLC unlawful, can"}

But again, \nthis statement concerns voidable, rather than void, transactions (and the same is true \nof the authorities Mr Nahnybida refers to in footnote 150 as stating the same \nconclusion); and\n the Resolution of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court dated 17 April 2018 in case \nNo. 523/9076/16-ts concerned a claim to declare the actions of the founders of Norma \nPlus LLC unlawful, cancel the charter of the company and recover compensation for \nmoral damage. According to the claimant, the founders of Norma Plus LLC illegally \ncontributed property belonging to the claimant to the company’s authorised capital. The \nResolution is irrelevant to the issue at hand because: \n it concerned the alleged invalidity of a corporate decision, and the Supreme Court \nhas confirmed that the rules governing invalidity of ‘acts’ (such as corporate \ndecisions) are different to those governing invalidity of ‘transactions’23; and  \n the case reached the Supreme Court on an appeal concerning solely the \njurisdictional issue of whether the case fell within the competence of the \ncommercial or civil courts. \n At Nahnybida 3/220.3, Mr Nahnybida refers to a further authority, the Resolution of the \nSupreme Court dated 11 April 2018 in case No. 910/6160/17. In this case the claimant \nparticipated in an auction, did not win, and then sought to invalidate the auction on grounds \nthat the organisers lacked authority to conduct the auction. Transferring the claim for fresh \nconsideration, the Supreme Court concluded: “ alienation of property at public auction refers \nto sale and purchase agreements, such an agreement may be declared invalid by court on \nthe grounds established by Article 215(1) of the Civil Code of Ukraine … . In the event there \n22  The claimant alleged invalidity with reference to Articles 177, 181, 203, 215, 635, 656, 657 of the Civil \nCode, which contain general provisions compliance with which is necessary for a transaction to be valid. \nNone of these provisions defines particular transactions as void.  \n23  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 26 November 2019, case No. 910/9092/18. \nC6/1/21\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 22 - are several participants in the disputed transaction, and the claim is filed by one of them, the \ncommercial court must decide on the issue of bringing all the mentioned persons to \nparticipate in the case as defendants ”. Yet again, Mr Nahnybida relies on a case that \nconcerned a transaction said to be voidable (under Article 215(1) of the Civil Code).  \n Lastly, at Nahnybida 3/220.4, Mr Nahnybida cites a number of judgments of the European \nCourt of Human Rights in support of his apparent contention that it would violate the \nfundamental rights of the 50 Borrowers under Article 6 of the European Convention for the \nProtection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms if the English court were to \nconclude, in their absence, that the Relevant Loans and Relevant Supply Agreements that \nthey executed are void as a matter of Ukrainian law. As I have already noted, the question \nof whether parties are required to be joined to proceedings, including by reference to rights \narising under Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and \nFundamental Freedoms (“ ECHR ”), is considered by Ukrainian law to be a procedural issue, \nrather than a substantive issue. To the extent that any issue arises in this case as to the \ncontent or proper application of ECHR Article 6, I am instructed that it will be addressed by \nthe Bank’s counsel if necessary. Insofar as Ukrainian court practice is at all relevant, and as \nI have already noted, the cases discussed by Mr Nahnybida and Mr Alyoshin concern facts \nvery different to the present case; not only do those cases concern voidable (rather than \nvoid) transactions, but none of them address any situation comparable to the"}

There, I gave my opinion that as a matter of Ukrainian law the 2014 \nJudgments should not have any preclusive effect on the Bank’s claims in these proceedings.  \n By way of background, the 2014 Judgments resulted from a set of materially identical claims \nbrought by certain Borrowers against the Defendant Suppliers and the Bank between \nSeptember and November 2014. The Borrowers claimed that because no goods had been \nsupplied to them by the Defendant Suppliers under the Relevant Supply Agreements, \ntherefore the court should (i) order the Defendant Suppliers to return the funds \n(prepayments) transferred to the Defendant Suppliers under the Relevant Supply \nAgreements, and (ii) terminate the pledge agreements by which the Borrowers had pledged \nto the Bank their contractual rights to the goods to be received under the Relevant Supply \nAgreements.  \n The 2014 Judgments were made a short time later, between 15 October and 24 November \n2014. Uniformly, they ordered the Defendants Suppliers to return the prepayments to the \nBorrowers, but rejected the Borrowers’ claims to terminate the pledge agreements. \nAlleged preclusive effect \n Mr Nahnybida claims, at Nahnybida 3/220.6, that the 2014 Judgments “ established that the \nobligations arising under the Relevant Supply Agreements between the Borrowers and the \n[Defendant Suppliers]… did arise ”, notes that the Bank at the time “ did not make any \nattempts to argue that the Relevant Supply Agreements were invalid and/or void ”, and \nconcludes that “ [u]nless and until the Bank obtains orders from the Ukrainian Court to set \naside these judgments, they remain valid and so it would not be open to the Bank to argue \nthat the Relevant Supply Agreements are invalid … ”. Mr Nahnybida relies upon Article 75(4) \nof the Code of Commercial Procedure, which provides: \n“4. Circumstances established by a court decision in a commercial, civil or administrative \ncase that has entered into force shall not be proved in another case involving the same \npersons or a person in respect of whom these circumstances have been established, unless \n24  For the purposes of my first report, Hogan Lovells provided me with one of the 2014 Judgments, in respect \nof proceedings brought by Agropromtekhnologia LLC, which I was instructed was represen"}

Such \nfacts are deemed to have been ‘prejudged’. This evidential rule aims at ensuring procedural \neconomy by allowing facts that have been proven and found to exist in a judgment that has \nentered into force not to have to be proven again in subsequent proceedings between the \nsame parties (or party, if the relevant finding of fact relates to one party only). The application \nof the rule in the subsequent proceedings is far from absolute, however; the prior factual \nfindings may be disputed and rebutted, and the court ultimately retains a discretion to \ndetermine whether justice requires the prejudged facts to be relied upon in all the \ncircumstances of the case27.  \n In order for facts contained in a judgment to qualify as prejudged facts in subsequent \nlitigation, the following criteria must be satisfied:  \n the judgment must be final and binding;  \n the facts must form part of the court’s findings (and are not, for example, merely \ncontained in the ‘descriptive’ part of the judgment narrating the parties’ respective \npositions);  \n25  Meaning that the judgment has entered into force within the meaning of the applicable procedural Code. \n26  See Article 82(5) of the Ukrainian Code of Civil Procedure; Article 75(4) of the Code of Commercial \nProcedure; and Article 78(5) of the Code of Administrative Procedure. \n27  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 8 August 2019, Case No. 922/2013/18; Resolution of the Supreme \nCourt dated 29 April 2021, Case No. 920/1111/19; Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 15 July 2021, \nCase No. 910/19256/16. \nC6/1/24\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 25 -  the findings of fact must have been made in court proceedings between the same \nparties, or if only one of the parties participated in the prior court proceedings, the \nfindings must have been made in respect of that party; and \n the subsequent proceedings must concern the very same factual issue that was \ninvestigated by the prior court giving rise to the finding of fact in question. \n Further as regards requirement (b) above: \n if the court only considers or discusses issues of fact without making any relevant \nfindings, or does not record any evidence said to support such findings, the court’s \ncomments will not qualify as prejudged facts28; \n only thos"}

See also Resolution of Supreme Court dated 28 \nJanuary 2020, Case No. 917/1335/18, in which the court held that: “ preclusion may only be established in \nrespect of those circumstances that were specifically investigated and ascertained by the court and \nreflected in the determinative reasoning part of the judgment. Circumstances mentioned [in the judgment] , \nbut not assessed by the court, cannot be considered as having been determined and [therefore] do not \nhave preclusive effect ”. \n30  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 18 August 2022, case No. 910/1674/20, where the court said in \nrelation to identifying prejudged facts: “ It is important that the circumstances established in the first case, \nwhich are prejudicial should be related to the subject of proof, i.e., their establishment should be necessary \nto resolve that case ”. \n31  See Article 75(7) of the CComP, Article 82(7) of the CCivP, and Article 78(7) of the CAP.

This is unsurprising, as no \nallegation that the Relevant Supply Agreements were void, or were voidable and should be \ninvalidated, appears to have been made in the Ukrainian proceedings. Instead, the \nBorrowers merely sought repayment from the Suppliers under the Relevant Supply \nAgreements (which the Suppliers did not contest) and the Borrowers’ claims against the \nBank concerned only their pledge agreements (and, even then, the Borrowers only sought \nthe termination of those pledge agreements, not their invalidation) 32. \n Whilst the 2014 Judgments refer to the Relevant Supply Agreements "}

To the \ncontrary, I do not see from my review of the 2014 Judgments that any facts or matters were \nalleged that, if established, would result in the Relevant Supply Agreements being void as a \nmatter of law, and so it was not open to the courts hearing the Borrowers’ claims to establish \nthe existence of any such facts and matters and determine whether circumstances existed \nthat would render the Relevant Supply Agreements void. In other words, the question of the \nvalidity of the Relevant Supply Agreements was simply not at issue in the 2014 proceedings, \nand the absence of any findings of voidness cannot be equated with the courts finding the \nRelevant Supply Agreements to be valid, and can have no preclusive effect whatsoever in \nrelation to the Bank’s present claim.  \n As regards Mr Nahnybida’s suggestion that the Bank should be prevented from making \nallegations in these proceedings that it did not make during the 2014 proceedings \n(specifically, that the Relevant Supply Agreements are void), I note that he does not identify \nany rule of Ukrainian law on which his suggestion relies. To the extent that Mr Nahnybida \nmeans to contend that the Bank has abused its procedural rights by making allegations in \nthese proceedings that it could have made, but did not make, in the 2014 proceedings, or \n32  Furthermore, because (i) the First and Second Defendants were not party to the 2014 Judgments, and (ii) \nthe alleged finding in the 2014 Judgments regarding the Relevant Supply Agreements that is said by Mr \nNahnybida to have preclusive effect in these proceedings, was not made in respect of the Bank (which \nwas not party to the Relevant Supply Agreements), therefore as a matter of Ukrainian law that finding could \nnot in any event be relied upon by the First and Second Defendants as having any preclusive effect in \nthese proceedings for purposes of the Bank’s claims against them.  \nC6/1/26\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 27 - that the Bank in bad faith has contradicted its prior behaviour to the detriment of the \nDefendants (such that the doctrine of venire contra factum proprium , which I discuss below \nat paragraphs 104 to 110, might apply), then I do not agree:   \n First, it is clear from the Bank’s pleadings in these proceedings that its case includes \nallegations that: (i) the Relevant Supply Agreements were part of a fraudulent scheme \nagainst the Bank (i.e. the Misappropriation) procured by the First and Second \nDefendants whilst they owned and controlled the Bank; and (ii) the Bank’s new \nmanagement did not discover the factual circumstances upon which its claims in these \nproceedings are based until some time after it was nationalised at the end of 2016. If \nthe Bank’s case in these respects is proven at trial, then I cannot see that any basis \nwould exist upon which a Ukrainian court would find that the Bank’s current claims are \nabusive or that the Bank has acted in bad faith such that the doctrine of venire contra \nfactum proprium could apply.  \n Secondly, as I explain at paragraph 109 below, that doctrine cannot apply to prevent a \nvoid transaction being confirmed as void by the courts if the circumstances giving rise \nto voidness as a matter of Ukrainian law are proven. \nThree related arbitration rulings \n"}

Copies of the 2015 Arbitration Rulings have been provided to me by Hogan \nLovells. Apart from the different forum, the material points of difference between the 2015 \nArbitration Rulings and the 2014 Judgments appear to be that: (i) the Bank is not a party to \nthe 2015 Arbitration Rulings, and (ii) the 2015 Arbitration Rulings do not refer to the pledge \nagreements by which the Borrowers pledged to the Bank their contractual rights to the goods \nto be received under the Supply Agreements.  \n Mr Nahnybida does not refer to the 2015 Arbitration Rulings, and does not appear to suggest \nthat they would have any preclusive effect, but for completeness I note that (i) the Bank was \nnot party to those arbitration proceedings; and (ii) facts established in arbitration rulings, \nunlike those established in court judgments, cannot give rise to prejudged facts under \nC6/1/27\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 28 - Ukrainian law (Article 82(8) of the Code of Civil Procedure and Article 75(8) of the Code of \nCommercial Procedure).  \nTransactions contrary to public order under Article 228 of the Civil Code (“Article 228”) \n The experts’ points of agreement under this sub-heading are set out at JR/11. The one \nsubstantive area of disagreement, at JR/12, arises because the experts disagree as to \nwhether Article 228(1) is to be interpreted and applied broadly or narrowly.  \n My view is that Article 228(1) is to be interpreted broadly and, in particular, that it can be \napplied to transactions between private (non-State) entities or individuals that involve a \nviolation of property rights (JR/12.2). Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida disagree; they say that \nArticle 228(1) is “ subject to narrow and specific criteria that are only found in exceptional \ncircumstances  – namely, when contracts strike at the essential foundations of the rule of \nlaw” (JR/12.3). \n In support of my view, I referred at Beketov 8/36-40 to court practice including the Resolution \nof the Supreme Court dated 7 October 2020 in case No. 911/2574/18, JSC \nChornomornaftogaz v. Ukratomenergo LLC, which concluded:\n“The scope and substance of the “public order” concept should be understood in a broad \nsense that is characterised by variability, which is due to the continuous evolution of social \nrelations and the discretionary nature of their legal regulation. It is impossible and \ninadvisable to narrow the definition of this concept to certain strict limits ”. \n On 8 December 2021, after I produced Beketov 8, the Supreme Court issued a further \nResolution in the Chornomornaftogaz  case (which had come back to the Supreme Court \nafter being returned to the lower courts for further consideration)33, which is important to \nconsider. In this Resolution, the Supreme Court stated: \n“At the same time, the category of public policy does not apply to any legal relations in the \nstate, but only to those that relate to the essential foundations of the legal order. \nIn view of the above, it can be concluded that public policy consists of public-law \nrelationships that are imperative and determine the foundations of the social order of the \nstate. … \n33  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 8 Dece"}

Agrofirma “Slavutych” \nPE, Person 4, Person 2  (in which Person 5 was named as a third party), confirmed as void \non grounds of public policy a sale purchase agreement entered into between two private \nindividuals. The case concerned shareholdings in an agricultural company Agrofirma \n“Slavutich” PE (“ Agrofirma ”), in which the two founders, Person 7 and Person 4, owned \n60% and 40% shareholdings, respectively. After Person 7 died, his 60% shareholding was \ninherited in equal parts by his wife (Person 3) and two daughters (Persons 1 and 5), but \nPerson 4 proceeded to call a general meeting of Agrofirma’s shareholders without Persons \n3, 1 or 5 being notified or present and, at that meeting, Person 4 resolved to refuse to accept \nPerson 7’s heirs as participants in Agrofirma and to re-register 100% of the company’s \nshares to himself. Person 4 then sold 100% of Agrofirma’s shares to Person 2 by way of a \nshare purchase agreement that the claimants (Persons 3 and 1) alleged was void on \ngrounds of public policy. The Supreme Court agreed, concluding: \n“117. The courts of first and appellate instance found that on 10 April 2018 PERSON_4 and \nPERSON_2 entered into a disputed contract of sale, under which (paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2) \nPERSON_4 had to transfer to PERSON_2 share in the authorized capital of PE Agrofirm \n“Slavutych” in the amount of UAH 34,000.00, which is 100% of the authorized capital, and \nthe buyer had to accept this share and pay for it in the amount and manner specified in the \ncontract.

Therefore, if the invalidity of a certain transaction is established by law, a claim for its \ninvalidation is not an appropriate way to protect the right or interest of the plaintiff. If there is \na dispute over the legal consequences of an invalid transaction (which one of the parties of \nwhich or another interested person considers it null and void) the court checks the relevant \narguments and in the reasoning part of the judgment, applying the relevant provisions of \nsubstantive law, evaluates the transaction for nullity. \n124.

They further state that Article 228(1) “ does not extend to a situation where \none party to an agreement causes loss to another party by failing to perform it ” (JR/12.4), \nbut I note that this is not the Bank’s case. The Bank’s claims are in tort and unjust \nenrichment; it does not claim for breach of contract.  \n Mr Alyoshin quotes various Supreme Court Resolutions in support of these views at Alyoshin \n1/84-86, but the quotations on which he relies do not contradict my position as set out above. \nIn particular: \n the Resolution of 2 July 2020 in case No. 910/4932/19, quoted at Alyoshin 1/84, \nconfirms that transactions that violate public order include “ transactions infringing upon \nthe public, economic and social foundations of the state, in particular transactions aimed \nat the use of communal, state or private property contrary to the law; … ”;  \nC6/1/30\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 31 -  at Alyoshin 1/85, he cites the Resolution dated 7 October 2020 in case No. 911/2574/18 \nthat I relied on at Beketov 8/36 (because it expressly states that the concept of public \npolicy should be interpreted broadly and that it is inadvisable to narrow the definition by \napplying strict limits). Mr Alyoshin appears to rely on this Resolution for the statement, \n“[t]he mere fact that a transaction violates a certain legal rule is not decisive for a finding \nof non-compliance with public policy …”, but I agree with this statement, which does not \ncontradict at all my position that a transaction aimed at violating a private citizen’s \nconstitutional rights to private property will be considered to violate the social order of \nthe state and so "}

He provides no authority for this proposition. \n This was not identified in the Joint Report as an area of disagreement (which may indicate \nthat Mr Nahnybida has abandoned this proposition), but for the avoidance of doubt, I \ndisagree. For example, in the Agrofirma case discussed at paragraph 72 above, there was \nno prior criminal verdict in respect of the relevant sale purchase agreement, between Person \n4 and Person 2, which was confirmed to be void under Article 228(1). \nAmendment to Beketov 8/37\n The Supreme Court’s Resolution of 8 December 2021 in the Chornomornaftogaz case, \ndiscussed at paragraph 69 above, clarified that in order for a transaction to be void as \ncontrary to public order under Article 228(1), it is not enough that it contravene a state or \npublic interest. Contravention of a state or public interest is instead the criterion that suffices \nfor a transaction to be voidable under Article 228(3): \n“As it could be seen from the case materials, the claimant points out that the contract […] \nviolates public policy, because it was concluded for a purpose contrary to the interests of \nthe state and society, its moral principles. That is, the claimant in the claim identified grounds \nfor invalidating the disputed transaction, under Part. 3 Article. 228 of the Civil Code of \nUkraine (non-compliance with the requirements regarding the compliance of the transaction \nwith the interests of the state and society, its moral principles) with the signs of the voidness \nof the transaction provided for in parts 1, 2 of this Article of the Civil Code of Ukraine \n(violation of public order). \nC6/1/31\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 32 - Taking into account the principle jura novit curia (“the court knows the law”), the necessity \nof taking into account by the courts when applying the norms of law is pointed out by the \nGrand Chamber of the Supreme Court in the resolution of September 4, 2019 in case No. \n265/6582/16-c, the courts of previous instances came to the correct conclusion that the \nclaims are actually reduced to the invalidation of the contract under Art. 228(3) of the Civil \nCode of Ukraine, which governs the issue of invalidating voidable transaction. ” \n This is contrary to what was suggested in the Supreme Court’s earlier resolution of 7 October \n2020, which I quoted at Beketov 8/36. Accordingly, my statement in the second sentence of \nBeketov 8/37, that “ the requirement is simply that there exist a public or state interest in the \ntransaction ”, needs to be updated, as that sentence no longer reflects my opinion following \nthe 8 December 2021 Resolution.  \n Instead, as reflected in the point of agreement at JR/11.3, I share the view of the other \nexperts that in order to be void under Article 228(1) a transaction must infringe the \nconstitutional rights and freedoms of an individual and citizen, or destroy, damage or \nmisappropriate the property of an individual, a legal entity, the state, the Autonomous \nRepublic of Crimea, or a territorial community.

For the avoidance of doubt, my view (as \nexplained above) is that transactions between private (non-State) entities or individuals are \ncapable of contravening public order in this way, especially where, as the Bank alleges in \nthis case, the (void) transactions are part of a scheme to misappropriate assets. \nTransactions under Article 235 of the Civil Code (“Article 235”) \n The experts’ points of agreement under this sub-heading are set out at JR/13. The one point \nof disagreement, at JR/14, arises because Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida do not agree with \nmy view that although Article 235 does not expressly state that a ‘sham’ (my preferred \ntranslation) or ‘mock’ (Mr Alyoshin’s preferred translation) transaction is ‘void’, as a matter \nof substance this is its consequence.  \n The principal reason for my view is the mandatory language of Article 235: \n“Article 235. Legal consequences of a sham transaction \n1. A transaction shall be sham if it has been concluded by the parties for the purposes of \nconcealing another transaction, which they actually concluded. \n2. In case it is established that the transaction has been concluded by the parties to conceal \nanother transaction, which they actually concluded, the relations between the parties shall \nbe governed by the rules applicable to such actual transaction ”. \nC6/1/32\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 33 -  In my view, this language makes clear that if the requisite circumstances are established \n(i.e. that the transaction has been concluded by the parties for the purpose of concealing \nanother transaction), the transaction that the parties purported to conclude “ shall” be a sham \nand the relationship between the parties “ shall” instead be governed by the rules applying \nto the concealed transaction. This mandatory language is inconsistent with sham \ntransactions being voidable, i.e. at the court’s discretion, and is consistent with a sham \ntransaction being of no legal effect as a matter of law. In my view, that is the same \nconsequence as it being void. \n In this regard, I note that the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 3 February 2021 in \ncase No. 694/523/18, stated that a void transaction is one that does not give rise to any \nrights or obligations for the parties: \n“When considering the dispute, the court of first instance did not pay attention to the fact \nthat the signed agreement between the parties due to its nullity should be considered from \nthe legal perspective as not legally valid, having created no legal consequences other than \nthose related with its invalidity. A void agreement cannot be considered valid, as together \nwith all its terms it does not create for the parties the obligations enshrined in it ”. \n Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida’s statement of disagreement at JR/14.2 does not contradict \nmy view in any respect, so the basis for their disagreement with me is unclear. It appears \nthey may be concerned that describing a sham (mock) transaction as void entails that the \nactual transaction concealed by the sham transaction also is void, but that has never been \nsuggested by me. \n I also note that Alyoshin 1/101 considers a Supreme Court Resolution that squarely supports \nmy view. In that case, the claimant asked the court to declare a lease to be a sham \ntransaction under Article 235, but the Supreme Court held (in Mr Alyoshin’s words) “ that a \ndeclaration that a contract was a mock transaction could not be granted as an independent \nremedy ”.

As explained at paragraphs 33 to 34 above, a declaration that a void transaction \nis void is not an available remedy under Ukrainian law, so this Resolution is entirely \nconsistent with my view that the prescribed effects of a transaction being confirmed to be a \nsham transaction under Article 235 are the same as it being void. \nC6/1/33\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 34 - Related party transactions under Article 52 of the Law on Banks (“Article 52”) \n The experts’ points of agreement under this sub-heading are set out at JR/15. There are two \npoints of disagreement. \nVoid or voidable \n First, whilst Mr Alyoshin and I agree that, prior to 8 March 2015, under Article 52 a bank’s \ntransactions with related parties on non-market terms were voidable, we disagree as to \nwhether amendments to Article 52 coming into effect on that date mean that such \ntransactions entered into after 8 March 2015 are void.  \n The relevant amendment was as follows: before 8 March 2015, Article 52 stated that: \n“Transactions concluded by bank with the related parties on terms more favorable than usual \nare declared by the court invalid from the moment of their conclusion ”, but by the amendment \nthe underlined words “ by the court ” were removed. Article 52 now provides that such \ntransactions are “ declared invalid from the moment of their conclusion ”.  \n Mr Alyoshin’s view is that because Article 52 still refers to a need to ‘declare’ such \ntransactions invalid, they must still be voidable (not void).  \n As a preliminary point, I note that Mr Alyoshin’s argument seems to implicitly accept what I \nhave said at paragraphs 33 to 34 above as regards the impossibility under Ukrainian law of \na court declaring a void transaction to be void, thus undermining Mr Alyoshin’s position that \na court order will sometimes be required in order for a transaction to be void. \n I do not agree that the continued presence of the word “ declare ” in Article 52 means that his \nview is correct: \n any potential confusion caused by the presence of this word is, I consider, removed by \nthe fact that the words “ by the court ” were deleted from the Article. This deletion reveals \nthe Ukrainian Parliament’s intention to change the status of related party transactions \non non-market terms from voidable to void. If Parliament intended such transactions to \nremain voidable (as they were before 8 March 2015), the removal of the words “ by the \ncourt ” would make no sense. Nor can I conceive of any reason for Parliament to have \nremoved these words other than to change the status of related party transactions on \nnon-market terms from voidable to void; \nC6/1/34\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 35 -  in context, and taking into account Parliament’s deletion of the words “ by the court ”, the \nremaining words “ declared invalid from the moment of their conclusion ” in my view \nmean that a transaction caught by Article 52 effectively is declared invalid by the statute \n(rather than by the court). As such, the transaction is invalid by operation of law, i.e. \nvoid. Whilst Article 52 does not use the word ‘void’ to describe such transactions, the \nSupreme Court has said that it is not necessary for a statute to state precisely that a \ntransaction is ‘void’ in order for it to be so, provided that there is a direct indication of \nsuch invalidity in the text of the statute34; \n the Explanatory Note that accompanied the bill containing the relevant 2015 \namendments to the Law on Banks (and various other Laws), dated 28 February 2015, \nstated that the bill’s purpose wa"}

I consider that it would be \nconsistent with this purpose for related party transactions breaching Article 52 to have \nbeen reclassified from voidable to void; and \n Parliament’s intention is also evident from the wording of Article 38 of the DGF Law, \nwhich lists types of bank transactions that are void. The list includes transactions caught \nby Article 52: \n“Article 38. Measures to ensure the preservation of a bank’s assets, prevent loss of a \nbank’s property and losses to a bank \n3. Transactions, including those concluded with persons related to the bank, in which \nthe Fund carries out temporary administration and / or liquidation procedure, are void \nfor the following reasons: \n[…] \n8) the bank has entered into a transaction with a person related to the bank or in the \ninterests of a person related to the bank, or in favour of a person related to the bank in \nviolation of law, including invalidity of which is established by Article 52(6) of [the Law \non Banks] ”. \n34  Supreme Court Resolution dated 11 August 2021, case No. 344/2483/18.  \nC6/1/35\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 36 -  Mr Alyoshin says that his contrary view is unequivocally supported by case law, but the two \nSupreme Court Resolutions he cites at Alyoshin 1/112 do not support that proposition: \n Mr Alyoshin first cites the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 9 November 2021 in \ncase No. 910/11069/21, a case in which the claimant indeed sought to invalidate a sale \nand purchase agreement on the basis of Article 52 (as amended). The case reached \nthe Supreme Court only at an interlocutory stage, however, when the claimant appealed \nthe lower court’s refusal of his application for interim measures, and the resulting \nResolution, relied upon by Mr Alyoshin, does not say anything about the proper \ninterpretation of Article 52. After the case was remanded and tried, the claimant’s claim \nwas dismissed at first instance35 (due to lack of standing) and on appeal36 (due to the \nsale and purchase agreement being found to have been on market terms and so not in \nbreach of Article 52). Neither court considered the proper interpretation of Article 52. \n The same is true of the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 19 October 2021 in \ncase No. 904/5506/18, which resolved a cassation appeal arising from the lower court’s \ndecision to close the proceedings in part, and which also did not say anything about the \nproper interpretation of Article 52 (as amended). \nDetermining if terms are non-market \n The second point of disagreement (at JR/17) arises because Mr Alyoshin only partly agrees \nwith my opinion that when determining whether or not particular terms of a transaction \nbetween a bank and a related party are non-market, the key question for a court to ask is \nwhether those terms are more advantageous (to the related party) than either: \n terms offered by that bank to the market generally (by ‘the market’, I mean borrowers \nthat are similar to the actual borrower in question, but which are not related parties); or  \n terms offered in the market generally by other banks."}

In my view, \nMr Alyoshin’s approach would improperly limit the facts that a court could take into account \nwhen resolving this question of fact. \nSignificant transactions under Article 70 of the JSC Law (“Article 70”) \n The experts’ points of agreement under this sub-heading are set out at JR/18. The one point \nof disagreement arises because, whilst Mr Alyoshin and I agree that, prior to 1 May 2016, a \njoint stock company’s unauthorised significant transactions were voidable, we disagree as \nto whether amendments to the JSC Law coming into effect on that date mean that such \ntransactions entered into after 1 May 2016 can properly be described as having the same \nlegal consequences as a void transaction. \n As set out at Beketov 8/62-63, Article 72 of the JSC Law (“ Article 72”) now provides that \nsignificant transactions that are not authorised by a bank (that is a joint stock company) in \naccordance with Ukrainian law and its internal rules and regulations “ shall not give rise to, \nor change, or terminate, any civil rights or obligations of the joint stock company ”, unless \nsubsequently ratified in the prescribed manner (in which case, from the date of ratification \nthe significant transaction will be treated as having affected the company’s rights and \nobligations retrospectively to the date on which the transaction was entered into). I consider \nthis description of the mandatory consequences of a significant transaction that has been \nneither authorised (in advance) nor ratified (after the event) in the prescribed manner as \nlegally equivalent to those of a void transaction.  \n In support of his contrary view, Mr Alyoshin states at Alyoshin 1/119 that where the execution \nof a contract is subject to compliance with corporate procedures, a failure to follow those \nprocedures may render the contract voidable, but not void. Mr Alyoshin relies in support on \nthe Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 9 June 2021 in case No. 911/3039/19, NPP ASU \nLLC v. Fakel PJSC . In that case, a contract for the supply of goods was concluded in \nFebruary 2019 and over the spring and summer of 2019, the buyer received tranches of \ngoods and paid for certain of those tranches. Then in November 2019 the buyer’s \nsupervisory board resolved not to approve retrospectively (i.e. ratify) the contract.

The Supervisory Board has the right to approve transactions, but disapproval of the \ntransaction by this body must have a reasonable explanation, motives. The failure to \napprove an executed and partially performed transaction without any reason is an abuse of \nthe claimant’s right, which was intended to cause harm to the counterparty. The Court \nconsiders that the only motive for such a disapproval is refusal to discharge the obligations \narising under the agreement at issue. \n64. Filing a counterclaim seeking recognition of the agreement invalid, Fakel PJSC did not \nask the court to apply the consequences of the invalidity of the transaction, did not state \nthat he had the goods and the intention to return them to [the supplier], which is additional \nevidence of another purpose of this claim - not to pay the debt to the supplier ”. \n I acknowledge that the effect of the Supreme Court’s Resolution in this unique case was to \nuphold the legal effect and consequences of an unauthorised significant transaction that \nwas never ratified. However, as the quotation above shows, that was only because the court \nconcluded that the Supervisory Board’s disapproval of the contract (i.e. failure to ratify) was \nitself an abuse of rights in all the circumstances of the case. Such a wrongful, abusive \ndisapproval fell to be undone, making this tantamount to a case where the contract was \nratified. \n I do not, therefore, consider that this Resolution contradicts my position that a significant \ntransaction that is neither authorised nor ratified can properly be described as having the \nsame effect as a void transaction, insofar as it “ shall not give rise to, or change, or terminate, \nany civil rights or obligations of the joint stock company ”. To the contrary, all that this \nResolution shows, in my view, is that where Ukrainian law expressly provides for a \ntransaction that is of no legal effect to be given legal effect upon subsequent ratification, the \n37  The Supreme Court noted that the buyer inter alia never notified the supplier of its supervisory board’s \ndecision not to ratify the agreement (which came to light only after the supplier sued the buyer), never \noffered to return the delivered but unpaid for goods, and was unable to explain to the court any reason for \nthe failure to ratify. All of this raised “ reasonable doubts about the actual date and reasons for the \nSupervisory Board’s decision ”. Furthermore, the Supreme Court noted that the buyer never brought a claim \nagainst its former general director who had concluded the contract in excess of his authority, and found \nthat the (abusive) purpose of the buyer’s counterclaim was to avoid paying for goods that it had received.  \nC6/1/38\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 39 - abuse of rights doctrine is broad enough in scope to be applied where a company refuses, \nwithout reasonable explanation or motive, to ratify a transaction that it has already partly \nperformed, such that the transaction is treated as if ratified.  \n Alyoshin 1/120 then refers to Article 92(3) of the Civil Code, pursuant to which a legal entity \ncannot seek to invalidate an agreement that was entered into by its re"}

I do not consider Article 92(3) to be relevant here, however, \nas it provides a rule of general application to legal entities whereas Article 72 applies \nspecifically to a joint stock company’s unauthorised significant (and interested party) \ntransactions. Article 72, unlike Article 92(3), expresses in mandatory terms the \nconsequences of transactions falling within its scope (i.e. they “ shall not give rise to, or \nchange, or terminate, any civil rights or obligations of the joint stock company ”), and this is \nnot qualified with reference to the knowledge of the transactions’ counterparties.  \n The Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 27 June 2018 in case No. 668/13907/13-ts, \ncited by Mr Alyoshin, concerned a claim to invalidate a sale agreement pursuant to Articles \n92, 115, 203(1)-(3), 215(1) and 628 of the Civil Code on grounds that the seller’s chairman, \nwho concluded the agreement, had no authority to dispose of the subject property by \nhimself. The case had nothing to do with the proper interpretation of Article 72 of the JSC \nLaw. \nVenire contra factum proprium \n The experts’ points of agreement under this sub-heading are set out at JR/20. The one point \nof disagreement, at JR/21, is whether, in a case where a party alleges that a contract is void \nand establishes the circumstances giving rise to voidness as a matter of Ukrainian law, the \nprinciple of venire contra factum proprium  can be applied by a court so as to refuse to \n‘confirm’ (on my view of the court’s role in such a case) or ‘establish’ (on Mr Alyoshin’s view \nof the court’s role in such a case) that the transaction is void. \n Before explaining why, in my view, the principle of venire contra factum proprium  cannot be \napplied in such a case, I should first explain the nature and scope of potential application of \nthe principle in general.  \nC6/1/39\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 40 -  Unlike the abuse of rights rule, which is expressly enshrined in Article 13(3) of the Civil \nCode38, the principle of venire contra factum proprium  (literally, ‘prohibition of contradictory \nbehaviour’) is not expressly set out in any Ukrainian legislation. But recently (beginning in \n2019), the Supreme Court started to apply the principle as a way of giving effect to the \ngeneral principle of good faith enshrined in Article 3(6) of the Civil Code: “The general \nfoundations of civil legislation include ... justness39, good faith and reasonableness ”40. See \nfor example the extract from the Supreme Court’s Resolution dated 10 April 2019 in case \nNo. 390/34/17, quoted at Alyoshin 1/124.1: \n“Good faith (Article 3(6) of the Civil Code) refers to a standard of conduct characterised by \nhonesty, openness and consideration for the interests of the other party to the transaction \nor relationship in question. The doctrine of venire contra factum proprium (prohibition of \ninconsistent conduct) is based on the Roman maxim “non concedit venire contra factum \nproprium” (no one may act contrary to his previous conduct). \nAt the heart of the doctrine is the principle of good faith.

In its Resolution dated 10 \nNovember 2021, in case No. 206/2-1238/11, the Supreme Court stated: \n“The mentioned principle [good faith] underlies the doctrine of venire contra factum proprium \n(the prohibition of contradictory behaviour), which is based on the Roman maxim - “non \nconcedit venire contra factum proprium” (no one can act contrary to his previous behaviour). \nThe mentioned principle of Roman law “venire contra factum proprium” is an expression of \n“equitable estoppel” - one of the most important doctrines of common law. In the common \nlaw system, this doctrine is based on “principles of fraud” and aims to prevent a situation in \nwhich one party can take a different position in litigation of a case that differs from its earlier \nbehaviour or statements if this puts the other party at disadvantaged position. \nConduct contrary to good faith and fair business practice is, in particular, conduct that is \ninconsistent with the prior statements or conduct of a party, provided that the other party, \nacting to its own detriment, has reasonably relied on them ”. \n38  The abuse of rights rule is discussed at Beketov 8/75, 81-88 and at paragraphs 151 to 163 below. \n39  The Ukrainian word “ справедливість”, translated here as “ justness ”, also can be translated as “ justice ” \n(my preferred translation) or “ fairness ”. \n40  Article 3(6) of the Civil Code is discussed at Beketov 8/67, 76-80 and at paragraphs 118 to 120 and 134 \nto 138 below. \nC6/1/40\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 41 - Although the Supreme Court has not yet articulated in specific terms what is required in \norder for the principle of venire contra factum proprium to apply, based on the definition \nthat appears in the above Resolutions, I consider that it is now accurate to say that, \nunder Ukrainian law, the principle may be applied, at the court’s discretion, in \ncircumstances where: \n a claimant is seeking to have a voidable transaction declared invalid; \n that claimant has previously acted in a contrary manner by treating the transaction as \nvalid;  \n in applying to have the transaction declared invalid the claimant has violated the \nprinciple of good faith (i.e. it has acted in bad faith);  \n the defendant has reasonably relied upon the claimant’s prior conduct (in treating the \ntransaction as valid); and \n such reliance has been to the defendant’s detriment. \n As regards the area of disagreement described at JR/21, in my view the principle of venire \ncontra factum proprium cannot be applied by a Ukrainian court so as to uphold a void (as \nopposed to voidable) agreement. Void agreements are void as a matter of law, and neither \nthe courts41 nor the parties to a void transaction (see paragraph 46 above) have any ability \nto vary the consequences of a transaction being void as a matter of law. To allow the \nprinciple of venire contra factum proprium  to operate so as to allow the courts to refuse to \nconfirm as void a transaction that meets the criteria of voidness set down by law would be \nto give the courts a discretionary power that they do not have under Ukrainian law.

Having done so, the Bank is acting in bad faith and/or abusing \nits rights in seeking such an inconsistent determination in these proceedings and/or the \nprinciple of venire contra factum proprium applies as it is to be inferred that the \nborrowers have relied on the Bank’s statements of their accounts ”. \n Reading the above statements together, I understand Mr Alyoshin’s opinion to be that if the \nBank has treated (and/or is continuing to treat) the Relevant, Intermediary and New Loans \nas valid in its accounts and financial statements, as alleged by the First Defendant, then \nupon application of the venire contra factum proprium principle the Bank should be \nprevented from pursuing in these proceedings its allegation that those Loans are void.  \n If I am correct in my understanding of Mr Alyoshin’s opinion, then I should make clear that I \ndisagree with him, for the following reasons: \nC6/1/42\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 43 -  as I have explained above, the principle of venire contra factum proprium cannot be \napplied by a Ukrainian court so as to uphold a void (as opposed to voidable) agreement. \nSo, if the Bank’s case that the Relevant, Intermediary and New Loans are void is \nconfirmed to be correct, in my view the principle could be of no application;  \n in order for the principle potentially to apply, it would be necessary for the First \nDefendant to show that the Bank has acted i"}

If, however, the Bank is correct \nin its allegation that the Relevant, Intermediary and New Loans were part of a fraudulent \nscheme against the Bank (i.e. the Misappropriation), then I cannot see any basis upon \nwhich the Bank’s allegations in this regard could be said to have been brought in bad \nfaith; and \n the First Defendant also would have to show that he relied on the Bank’s prior treatment \nof the Relevant, Intermediary and New Loans as valid to his detriment. However, \nparagraph 88 of the First Defendant’s Re-Re-Re-Amended Defence does not appear \nto include any allegation as to (i) the First Defendant’s reliance on the Bank’s alleged \nconduct in this regard, or (ii) any detriment suffered as a result.  \n Further in relation to this issue, Hogan Lovells has provided me with a copy of the Eighth \nWitness Statement of Richard Ian Lewis dated 6 July 2018, paragraphs 23 to 30 of which \nrefer to the Bank receiving, in 2017 and 2018, certain payments from the New Borrowers in \npurported repayment of the New Loans. Mr Lewis says of these payments: (i) “ given the \nBank’s losses as a result of the fraudulent scheme, it is not in the Bank’s interest to refuse \nmonies (however minimal) which could ultimately help it to reduce its losses ”, and (ii) “ the \nBank accepts it cannot double-recover, so will give credit in these proceedings for any \nrelevant sums purportedly paid under the [New] Loans and retained by the Bank in the \nmeantime ”.  \n If the Bank gives credit against its claimed loss in these proceedings for any purported \nrepayment of the New Loans it receives, I do not see how the First Defendant (or any other \nperson) could be said to have suffered any detriment in connection with relying on the Bank’s \ntreatment of the New Loans as valid. \nC6/1/43\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 44 - E. LIABILITY INTORT \n The experts’ many points of agreement under this heading are set out at JR/22, 24, 26, 30, \n33, 38, 40, 42, 43, 48, 50, 51, 52, 56, 57 and 60. I address our points of disagreement below.  \nElements of tort liability \n As recorded at JR/23, Mr Alyoshin does not agree with what I said at Beketov 8/67-69 \nregarding the principle of protecting victim’s rights, which I described as a “ foundational \nprinciple ” and an “ overarching objective ” of the Civil Code that guides the courts when \nconstruing the four elements of tort liability under Article 1166: unlawful conduct, harm, \ncausation and fault. Mr Alyoshin’s statement of disagreement, at JR/23.2, makes three \npoints to which I would respond as follows. \n First, Mr Alyoshin denies the existence of a coherent principle (of protecting victim’s rights) \nas an ‘overarching objective’ of the Civil Code. I do not agree; in my view the language of \nArticles 3, 15 and 16 of the Civil Code42 is consistent with my description: \n Article 3, “General Foundations of Civil Legislation”: “ The general foundations of civil \nlegislation are ... judicial defence of civil rights and interests ... [and] justness, good faith \nand reasonableness ”; \n Article 15, “ Right to Defence of Civil Rights and Interests ”: “Each person shall have the \nright to the defence of his civil right in the event of a violation, failure to recognise, or \ncontesting thereof ”; and \n Article 16, “ Defence of Civil Rights and Interests in Court ”: “Each person shall have the \nright to have recour"}

The means of defence of civil rights and interests may be ... \ncompensation of losses and other means of compensation of monetary losses; ... A \nCourt may defend a civil right or interest by other means established by contract or a \nlaw or by the court in cases established by the law ”. \n42  The right of a victim to judicial protection also is enshrined in Ukraine’s other procedural codes: see Article \n4 of the Civil Procedural Code, Article 4 of the Commercial Procedural Code, and Article 5 of the Code of \nAdministrative Proceedings. See also Articles 6 (right to fair trial) and 13 (right to effective remedy) of the \nEuropean Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms . \nC6/1/44\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 45 -  I consider it obvious (and I had thought it uncontroversial amongst Ukrainian lawyers) to \nconstrue these provisions as establishing an overarching general principle of protecting \nvictim’s rights, as I have described. Since a person whose right has been violated applies to \ncourt precisely to obtain effective protection of that right, it follows that the court considering \nthe case should be guided by the objective of ensuring such protection. To underline this \npoint, I note that: \n Article 2(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure states: “ The task of civil judiciary is fair, \nimpartial and timely consideration and resolution of civil cases with the aim of effective \nprotection of violated, unrecognized or contested rights, freedoms or interests of natural \npersons, rights and interests of legal entities, interests of the state ”; and \n Article 2 of the Law on the Judiciary and the Status of Judges provides that the courts \nare to conduct justice43, and both the Constitutional Court44 and Supreme Court45 have \nemphasised that justice requires the effective restoration of victims’ rights: \n“Justice is essentially recognised as such only if it meets the requirements of justice \nand ensures effective restoration of rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights \nof 1948 provides that everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent \nnational courts for acts violating the fundamental rights granted him by the constitution \nor by law (Article 8). The right to an effective remedy is also enshrined in the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 2) and in the Convention for \nthe Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (Article 13) ”46. \n This is why, in my view, Articles 3, 15 and 16 of the Civil Code are frequently referred to by \nthe courts when considering victims’ claims. In addition to the court practice cited at Beketov \n8/68, I would refer to the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 21 April 2021 in case No. \n552/6997/19: \n“According to Article 3(6) of the Civil Code of Ukraine, the general principles of civil law \ninclude, in particular, fairness, good faith and reasonableness. \nInterpretation of both Article 3 of the Civil Code of Ukraine as a whole and part 6 of Article 3 \nof the Civil Code of Ukraine shows that the general fundamentals (principles) of civil law are \n43  Article 2 of the Law on the Judiciary and the Status of Judges provides: “ The Court, doing justice on the \nbasis of the rule of law, guarantees everyone the right to a fair trial and respect for other rights and \nfreedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and laws o"}

This, in particular, is manifested in the fact that the general \nfundamentals (principles) are in essence the norms of direct application ”47. \n Secondly, Mr Alyoshin says that the courts “ do not approach claims with any particular \npredisposition to favor either the claimant or the defendant either generally or with respect \nto specific issues ”. I have not suggested, however, that the Ukrainian courts should be \npredisposed towards favouring the allegations of a victim / claimant over the allegations of \na defendant. What I do say is that Ukrainian law recognises that a purpose of the Civil Code, \nand of Ukraine’s judicial system, is to ensure that victims’ rights are adequately protected \nand restored where they have been violated, and this principle can and does guide the courts \nin construing the laws governing inter alia  the establishment of liability and the forms of relief \nconsequent on such liability, so as to ensure the law provides for adequate protection. \n Thirdly, Mr Alyoshin states that a victim’s right to protect its rights and interests “ does not \naffect the scope of damages that are otherwise recoverable as a matter of law ”. I believe \nthat Mr Alyoshin is referring here to what I said at Beketov 1/69, that the principle of \nprotecting victims’ interests is reflected in the principle of full compensation under Articles \n1166(1), 1192(1) and 22(3) of the Civil Code. I stand by my view. \n Lastly, I note that Mr Alyoshin has not commented specifically on the related view I \nexpressed at JR/23.1, that in accordance with the principle of protecting victim’s interests, \n“the element of unlawfulness [under Article 1166] is interpreted widely in Ukrainian tort law ”. \nI believe this to be the case, for the reasons given in Beketov 8/70-96 and the supplemental \nevidence in relation to the element of ‘unlawfulness’ that I set out below. \n47  This conclusion has been reiterated in a number of subsequent Supreme Court Resolutions. See, for \nexample, Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 9 February 2022, case No. 199/8422/17: “ The \ninterpretation of Article 3 of the Civil Code of Ukraine in general and para 6 of Article 3 of the Civil Code of \nUkraine [in particular] shows that the general fundamentals (principles) of civil law have a fundamental \nnature and other sources of legal regulation, primarily acts of civil legislation, must correspond to the \ncontent of the general principles. This, in particular, is manifested in the fact that the general fundamentals \n(principles) are in their essence norms of direct application and must be taken into account, in particular, \nwhen interpreting the norms contained in acts of civil legislation ”.  \nC6/1/46\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 47 - Unlawfulness \n The experts’ points of agreement regarding the element of unlawfulness (in general) are at \nJR/24 and 26.  \nPresumption of unlawfulness \n As recorded at JR/25, Mr Aly"}

They consider that no such presumption \narises. Mr Alyoshin goes so far as to say that “ the theory that all harm is presumed to be \nunlawful has virtually no support in case law ”, but his statement is clearly incorrect. My \nposition is explained at Beketov 8/93 with reference to supporting court practice from 2019, \nin addition to which I would also refer to the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 25 \nNovember 2020 in case No. 439/1127/18-ts, which expressly recognised the existence of \nthis presumption: “ At the same time, civil law is based on the presumption of unlawfulness \nof conduct, which led to damage, based on the principle of general tort: harm to a person or \nproperty should be considered illegal, unless otherwise provided by law ”48. \n The case that Mr Alyoshin relies upon at Alyoshin 1/191 (Resolution of the Supreme Court \ndated 20 September 2018 in case No. 753/23222/15-ts) pre-dates the authorities I rely upon \nand, from a reading of this Resolution, it does not appear that the Supreme Court was \nreferred to or gave consideration to a presumption of unlawfulness. The statement in that \nResolution that “ unlawful conduct of a tortfeasor shall consist of a breach of legal obligation, \nthat is manifested in the commission of acts prohibited by law, or in refraining from the \ncommission of the orders of the legal obligation to act in a certain way [i.e. a failure to act in \na way prescribed by the legal obligation] ” (which is a general statement with which I agree) \nshould be understood in that context. \n The academic writings referred to at Alyoshin 1/192-193 do not assist him either. As Mr \nAlyoshin himself agrees at JR/1.6, such writings are not a source of law, and as they were \npublished in 2011 and 2008, respectively, they do not take into account the Supreme Court’s \nmore recent recognition of the presumption of unlawfulness, as noted above. The views of \nthe academics that Mr Alyoshin relies upon are also contradicted by other academics, as he \nacknowledges at Alyoshin 1/195. \n48  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 25 November 2020, case 439/1127/18-ts. \nC6/1/47\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 48 -  Mr Alyoshin then says at Alyoshin 1/194 that it is wrong in principle to treat conduct that \ncauses harm as prima facie unlawful, and he uses the example of fair competition between \nbusiness. I do not consider this to be a good example for Mr Alyoshin, because: \n ‘unfair competition’ is defined by Ukrainian law49, and I consider that competition that \ndoes not fall within this definition would be deemed lawful, such that even if it caused \nharm, the presumption of unlawfulness would be rebutted; \n I do not agree that in circumstances of fair competition the conduct of competitor A (for \nexample, by lowering its prices) would be found to have caused harm to competitor B; \nrather, the cause would be the independent decisions of consumers to buy one product \nover another; and  \n for the same reason, lawful competition in my view does not cause harm to a \ncompetitor’s property. In a free market economy customers are free to choose with \nwhom to conduct business and, unless the law prescribes otherwise, no competitor \n‘owns’ any part of the market and hence a loss of market share cannot in my view \nconstitut"}

In a free market economy customers are free to choose with \nwhom to conduct business and, unless the law prescribes otherwise, no competitor \n‘owns’ any part of the market and hence a loss of market share cannot in my view \nconstitute harm to property rights. \n Lastly, at Alyoshin 1/195, Mr Alyoshin appears to suggest (with reference to an academic \nwriting that strongly supports the existence of a presumption of unlawfulness) that if such a \npresumption exists, it should be limited to situations where harm is caused to a victim’s \nabsolute rights, being those rights that, in Mr Alyoshin’s description, “ are protected against \nthe world at large, such as ownership rights, rights to life and health, and so on ”. I do not \nagree that the presumption should be limited to these instances; the Supreme Court’s \nstatement of the principle is not limited in this way. In any event, the loss alleged to have \nbeen suffered by the Bank in these proceedings was to its absolute ownership rights (i.e. of \nthe funds that were misappropriated), so Alyoshin 1/195 appears to support my position.  \n49  See Article 1 of the Law “On Protection Against Unfair Competition”: “Unfair competition shall be \nunderstood as any actions performed in the course of competition that are counter to trade and other fair \ncustoms in business activities”. Examples of such behaviour are further defined at inter alia Article 4 \n(illegitimate use of another entity’s business reputation); Article 5 (illegitimate use of another \nmanufacturer’s product); Article 6 (copying a product’s appearance); Article 7 (comparative advertising); \nArticle 8 (creating obstacles to competition or achieving illegitimate advantages in competition); Article 11 \n(causing a supplier to discriminate against a buyer) etc. The Law “On Protection of Economic Competition” \nadditionally prohibits anti-competitive coordinated actions of business entities and abuse of a monopoly \n(dominant) position in a market.  \nC6/1/48\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 49 - Relevance of subjective considerations \n Our next point of disagreement, at JR/27, has to do with the extent to which subjective \nconsiderations (i.e. of a defendant’s state of mind) are relevant to determining if their conduct \nis unlawful.  \n Mr Alyoshin and I are not far apart on this point as we appear to agree that “ in appropriate \ncases ”, subjective considerations are relevant. At JR/27.1, I gave an example of an \nappropriate case as one where a defendant intends to cause harm by their conduct, which \nin my view would be sufficient to render that conduct unlawful (see further Beketov 1/75-78, \nreferencing Article 13(3) of the Civil Code: “ a person’s actions aimed at hurting other persons \n… shall not be acceptable ”). Another example would be where a claimant seeks to impose \njoint and several liability upon a group of tortfeasors under Article 1190 on grounds that they \ntogether caused harm by their interconnected or cumulative actions, or actions taken with \nunity of intent (see further Beketov 8/184-189). \n The cause of our disagreement appears to be my view that, outside the examples above \n(and any other appropriate cases that may be identified), the unlawfulness of a person’s \nconduct generally is assessed objectively. I do not consider this to be a controversial \nstatement in Ukrainian law; where the unlawfulness of a person’s conduct arises from their \nbreach of a legal rule or the claimant’s rights, whether such breach occurred will be \ndetermined objectively and will not depend on the tortfeasor’s statement of mind.

Nevertheless, Mr Alyoshin has disagreed with me on this point, for reasons \nwhich are not evident from Alyoshin 1 or the Joint Report.  \nViolation of right without breach of specific duty \n At JR/28, the experts disagree as to whether a violation of a claimant’s rights without a \nbreach of the defendant’s duty is unlawful for the purposes of a tortious claim. In my view, it \nis. In Mr Alyoshin’s view, it will not be unlawful for a defendant to violate a claimant’s rights \nunless, by such conduct, the defendant also breaches a specific duty.  \n The essence of this dispute is whether Articles 3(1)(2), 3(6), 13(2) and 13(3) of the Civil \nCode constitute substantive rules of conduct that are mandatory for all participants in civil \nC6/1/49\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 50 - relationships in Ukraine, such that a defendant’s conduct that is contrary to any of these \nrules will be considered unlawful for purposes of Article 1166 (my view), or whether \nunlawfulness requires a defendant’s conduct to breach some other provision of law that \nimposes a specific duty on the defendant (Mr Alyoshin’s view). For ease of reference, these \nArticles provide: \n Article 3(1)(2): “ General foundations of the civil legislation include: ... unacceptability of \nownership deprivation except as established by the Constitution of Ukraine and the \nlaw”;\n Article 3(6): “ General foundations of the civil legislation include: ... justness, good faith \nand reasonableness ”; \n Article 13(2): “ A person exercising his civil rights shall refrain from actions that may \nbreach the rights of others … ” (in my view, this provision is particularly important as it \nshows that it is unlawful per se  to infringe upon the personal rights of another, even \nwhere this does not involve any breach of another specific legal prohibition); and  \n Article 13(3): “ a person’s actions aimed at hurting other persons as well as abusing the \nright in any way shall not be acceptable ”. \n At Beketov 8/77-80, I presented Supreme Court Resolutions that fully support my position \nthat conduct that is contrary to any of the above rules will be considered unlawful. I would \nalso refer to the following authorities: \n the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 21 April 2021 in case No. 552/6997/19, \nreferred to at paragraph 120 above, makes clear that the general principles at Article 3 \nof the Civil Code are of a fundamental nature and “ are in essence the norms of direct \napplication ”. As these general principles are of direct application, conduct that is \ncontrary to them is, in my view, properly regarded as being contrary to law, i.e., unlawful; \n the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 8 July 2020 in case No. 522/3541/15-ts \nstated: \n“In the opinion of the Supreme Court, such intentional actions of the plaintiff must be \nassessed as bad faith, aimed at violating the right of third parties to satisfy the creditor’s \ndemands, which indicates the presence of circumstances defined by Article 13(2) of the \nCivil Code of Ukraine. … \nC6/1/50\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 51 - The Supreme Court, reviewing a case in the cassation procedure, takes into account \nthe specific circumstances of this case regarding the presence of circumstances defined \nby Article 13(2)-(3) of the Civil Code o"}

The State Export-Import Bank of Ukraine JSC , \nthe claimant brought proceedings seeking to invalidate certain clauses of a bank deposit \nagreement, to have the bank return the balance of the deposited gold, and to recover \ninterest and compensation for moral harm50 arising from non-return of the deposit. The \nclaimant alleged that the bank had concealed from him, at the time of entering into the \nbank deposit  agreement, the consequences of certain restrictive resolutions of the NBU \nthat prevented the deposit being returned to the claimant upon expiration of the \nagreement. Neither the agreement nor Ukrainian law provided for compensation for \nmoral harm as a consequence of breaching such a bank deposit agreement, but the \nSupreme Court found that compensation for moral harm, as a means of protecting a \nvictim’s subjective civil right, can be awarded even where not expressly provided for by \nlaw or contract. In its Resolution dated 1 September 2020 the Grand Chamber of the \nSupreme Court stated: \n“49. Based on the provisions of Articles 16 and 23 of the Civil Code of Ukraine and the \ncontent of the right to compensation for moral damage in general as a way to protect a \nsubjective civil right, compensation for moral damage should occur in any case when it \nis caused - the right to compensation for moral (non-property) damage arises as a result \nof violation of the right of the person irrespective of existence of special norms of the \ncivil legislation ”51. \n(This Resolution reinforces the conclusion reached by the Supreme Court in PJSC\n“Bank Familnyi” v. Person 1 ,described at Beketov 8/79).  \n50  Moral harm encompasses inter alia psychological and emotional damage.

At the same time, good faith means the desire of a person to \nconscientiously use civil rights and ensure the fulfilment of civil obligations, which, in \nparticular, is confirmed by the content of Part 3 of Article 509 of this Code52.\nConsequently, the legislator, having brought the indicated principle into the Civil Code \nof Ukraine, thus established a certain limit on the behaviour of participants in civil legal \nrelations, therefore each of them is obliged to conscientiously exercise their civil rights \nand fulfil civil obligations, including providing for the possibility of harming the rights and \nthe interests of other persons.

One of the fundamental foundations of civil law is good faith (paragraph 6 of the \nfirst part of Article 3 of the Civil Code of Ukraine) and the actions of participants in civil \nlegal relations must be in good faith, comply with a certain standard of conduct, \ncharacterized by honesty, openness and respect for the interests of the other party to \nthe contract or the relevant legal relationship. \n52  Article 509 (3) of the Civil Code provides: “ The obligation must be based on the principles of good faith, \nreasonableness and fairness .” \n53  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 26 October 2021, case No. 910/9849/20; see the same approach \nin Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 24 November 2021 in case No. 910/10381/20 \nC6/1/52\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 53 - That is, civil relations are based on the presumption of good faith and honesty of the \nparticipants in civil relations, who have the right to rely on such conduct of other \nparticipants, which will meet the specified criteria and ideas of honour and conscience. \n76.2 Article 13, part 3 of the Civil Code of Ukraine stipulates that actions of a person \ncommitted with intent to cause harm to another person, as well as abuse of rights in \nother forms, are prohibited. \n76.3. The phrase “abuse of rights” must be understood as a contradiction, since if a \nperson exercises his own right, then his action is allowed, whereas if it is not allowed, \nthat is precisely why it is beyond his rights and is an action without right. The essence \nof an abuse of rights consists in the commission of actions by an authorised person that \nthat come within the relevant civil right, in bad faith, including where this is contrary to \nthe purpose of such right. \n[…] \n78.

We agreed, however, to present this point of disagreement in the following language, \nwhich I see now contains a typographical error that I have attempted to correct below:  \n“The experts disagree as to whether person A’s conduct is deemed to be unlawful for \npurposes of Article 1166 in a case when person A persuades or otherwise causes person B \nto enter into a loan agreement with person C with the person B’s intention of not repaying \n[sic: with person B intending not to repay] the loan to person C and passing the money to \n54  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 11 November 2021, case No. 910/8482/18; see the same approach \nin Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 2 February 2022, case No. 922/1474/21. \nC6/1/53\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 54 - person A instead ”. \n In my view, where a person committing an unlawful act, which causes harm, does so at the \nbehest of another (the procurer), then the procurer also will be regarded as having acted \nunlawfully, for purposes of Article 1166, if their act of procurement can be considered \nunlawful on any of the bases discussed at Beketov 8/70-96. So, in the above scenario, A’s \nprocurement of B’s conduct would be unlawful if (for example): \n A’s procurement of B’s conduct involved an abuse of right, for example being done with \nan intent on the part of A to cause harm to C, which would be contrary to Article 13(3) \nof the Civil Code (“ a person’s actions aimed at hurting other persons as well as abusing \nthe right in any way shall not be acceptable ”); and/or  \n A acted in breach of duty, for example if A was a director of C and so under a duty to \nact in C’s best interests (see generally Beketov 8/201–207 regarding the duties arising \nunder Article 92 of the Civil Code). \n Further, as noted at Beketov 8/185, if A and B are found to have jointly caused an indivisible \nharm to C, then each of them will bear joint and several liability for that harm pursuant to \nArticle 1190. \n Mr Alyoshin’s first point of disagreement, at JR/29.2, is that B’s conduct in the posited \nscenario would be a criminal act that could not be remedied in tort without a criminal \nconviction. This is a separate point between us that I address at paragraphs 168 to 177 \nbelow. \n Mr Alyoshin’s second point of disagreement, at JR/29.3, in fact suggests that there is not \nmuch between us on this issue. He says that “ causing a party B to enter into a loan is \nactionable only if the act of causing (which carries no specific or legally defined meaning) \namounts to an independent unlawful conduct under tort law ”. I agree. As explained above, \nif A’s procurement of B’s conduct involves an abuse of right, for example being done with \nan intent to cause harm to C, A’s procurement will constitute independent unlawful conduct. \nC6/1/54\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 55 - Unlawfulness: "}

There are two areas of \ndisagreement. \nBreach of Article 3(1)(6) \n The first, at JR/31, is whether conduct that breaches the general principles of justness \n(fairness), good faith and reasonableness set down in Article 3(1)(6) can, without more, \nsatisfy the requirement of unlawfulness for a tort claim. This point of disagreement \nsubstantively mirrors that at JR/28, discussed above, and I believe the authorities \nconsidered at paragraph 135 above, in addition to those considered at Beketov 8/77-80, \ndemonstrate that it is sufficient to establish unlawfulness for purposes of a tort claim that \nconduct is contrary to the principles enshrined in Article 3(1)(6). \nBreach of Article 3(1)(2) \n The second point of disagreement, at JR/32, is whether conduct that breaches the general \nprinciple of the unacceptability of ownership deprivation under Article 3(1)(2), otherwise than \nin accordance with law, can, without more, satisfy the requirement of unlawfulness for a tort \nclaim. This point of disagreement also substantively mirrors that at JR/2855, discussed \nabove, but Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida make further points in support of their position to \nwhich I shall now respond. \n First, Mr Alyoshin states at JR/32.3 that the prohibition on ownership deprivation contained \nin Article 3(1)(2), as well as in Article 41 of the Constitution, is aimed at preventing illegal \nownership deprivation by the state. His view, it seems, is that a Ukrainian citizen’s \nconstitutional right not to be deprived unlawfully of their property will not be violated if their \nproperty is taken unlawfully by another citizen, but only if taken unlawfully by the state. For \nthe following reasons, such a state-centric approach is completely unjustified:  \n Article 3 of the Civil Code specifies six general principles of Ukrainian civil law:  \n the inadmissibility of arbitrary interference in the sphere of a person’s personal life; \n55  This is most evident from the language used at Nahnybida 3/65: “ violation of the principle enshrined in \nArticle 3(1)(2) of the Civil Code, is possible only where the unlawfulness of the deprivation of the right of \nownership is proven by the Bank by proving that the conduct of the Corporate Defendants violated a \nspecific rule of law … ” \nC6/1/55\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 56 -  inadmissibility of deprivation of the right of ownership, except for the cases \nestablished by the Constitution of Ukraine and the law; \n freedom of contract;  \n freedom of entrepreneurial activity not prohibited by law; \n judicial protection of civil rights and interests; and \n fairness, good faith and reasonableness. \nI see no reason (and Mr Alyoshin offers none) why some of these general principles \nshould apply to all participants in civil relations – such as principle (iii), freedom of \ncontract, which self-evidently applies to private persons, and principle (vi), which as \ndiscussed above has been applied in numerous cases to non-state actors – whilst \nothers (in Mr Alyoshin’s view) should apply only to the state. Mr Alyoshin states at \nAlyoshin 1/200 that Article 3(1)(2) is “ addressed to the state ” and that his state-centric \nview “ gives due weight to the text of Article 3(1)(2) ”, but there is nothing in the wording \nof Article 3(1)(2) to suggest that this one principle, out of the six, should apply to the \nstate but "}

For example, Article 3(1)(2) has been applied in the resolution of \ndisputes between non-state actors (i.e. in private relations) regarding a defendant’s \nfailure to provide keys and original documents to certain buildings and interference with \nthe claimant’s religious activities56, and regarding the termination of a private lease \nagreement and return of the leased land plot57;  \n the wording of Article 3(1)(2) is similar to Article 3 of the ECHR, which provides: “ Every \nnatural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one \nshall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the \nconditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law ”. \nGuidance published by the European Court of Human Rights makes clear that Article 3 \n56  See Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 16 June 2021, case No. 902/627/19, Religious organization \n“Religious Community of the Holy Intercession Parish of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Orthodox Church \nof Ukraine) ” v. the Tulchinsk Eparchy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church . \n57  See Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 11 June 2020, case No. 140/891/17, Person 1 v. Farm \n“Vidrodzhennya ”. \nC6/1/56\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 57 - of the ECHR can be breached by private individuals as well as by the state: “ In \nparticular, when an interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of “possessions” \nis perpetrated by a private individual, a positive obligation arises for the State to ensure \nin its domestic legal system that property rights are sufficiently protected by law and \nthat adequate remedies are provided whereby the victim of an interference can \nvindicate his rights ”58. The ECHR forms part of the substantive law of Ukraine (see \nfurther paragraph 369 below); and \n in support of his position, Mr Alyoshin cites (only) a 2017 article published in the journal \nEntrepreneurship, Business and Law  (at Alyoshin 1/200), but I do not agree that this \narticle supports his conclusion. The author presents the views of various scholars on \nthe content of the principle of inviolability of property rights, but he does so in the context \nof the article’s main purpose of considering the specific issue of deprivation of property \nrights by the state with a view to proposing certain legislative changes. It is unsurprising, \ntherefore, that the text refers mainly to state action, as that is the focus of the article, \nbut nowhere does the article suggest that this is the extent of action caught by Article \n3(1)(2). On the contrary: \n at one point the article’s language clearly indicates that non-interference of the \nstate in the right to property is only one illustration of the principle of inadmissibility \nof deprivation of the right to property: “ among the demonstrations of the principle \nof the inadmissibility of deprivation of the right to property, the prohibition of \nrestrictions in the exercise of this right and non-interference of the state in its \nimplementation is determined ”; and \n at the end of the article, the author concludes: “ [t]he content of the principle of the \ninviolability of the right to property lies in the inadmissibility of arbitrary interference \nin this right by subjects of private and public law, including the state  ...”.  \n"}

All this suggests, however, is that where a person deprives \nanother of their property unlawfully, contrary to Article 3(1)(2), ordinarily this will also \n58  European Court of Human Rights, “Guide on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 – Protection of property”, published \n31 August 2022, paragraph 208.  \nC6/1/57\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 58 - (unsurprisingly) contravene other duties or standards of behaviour imposed by specific \nprovisions of law. That does not mean that a breach of Article 3(1)(2) alone would not be \nsufficient to render conduct unlawful if, hypothetically, no other provision of law was \nbreached. I draw further support for this view from the Scientific and Practical Commentary \nto the Civil Code cited by Mr Alyoshin in footnote 138 of his report, which he quotes as \nstating that the principles in Article 3 may be relied upon “ in the absence of specific legal \nprovisions governing the relations at issue ” (see also the authorities I refer to at paragraph \n135 above).  \n Thirdly, Mr Alyoshin lists several cases in footnote 138 in support of his assertion that Article \n3(1)(2) cannot itself provide a basis for finding conduct to be unlawful and is instead used \nas “an interpretive guide to the law only ”, but in my view these authorities do not support \nhim: \n the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 25 May 2021 in case No. 522/9893/17 \nconcerned a claim to declare a will invalid on grounds that it was notarised by a notary \nfrom the wrong notary district. The court refused the claim because the Civil Code does \nnot provide for invalidity on this ground. No conclusion regarding the direct application \nof Article 3(1)(2) was made by the Supreme Court; \n the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 1 October 2020 in case No. 904/5610/19 \narose from a breach of contract case where the defendant failed to timely pay an invoice \nin breach of its obligations under a contract of sale. I do not see how a breach of contract \ncase may be relevant to showing that a breach of Article 3(1)(2) cannot provide a basis \nfor finding unlawfulness of conduct for purposes of a tort claim; and \n the Ukrainian Constitutional Court’s Decision of 28 April 2021, case No. 3-\n95/2020(193/20), arose out of an application by PJSC IndustrialBank to the \nConstitutional Court to consider whether Articles 13(3) and 16(3) of the Civil Code are \nconstitutional. The application was substantiated by the fact that the Supreme Court \nhad refused to protect the bank’s rights because it found the bank to have abused those \nrights, stating in its decision that “ the claimant’s attempts to transfer money in a manner \nexpressly prohibited by law are a form of abusing the right ... no abuse of right is subject \nto judicial protection ”. The Constitutional Court established that Articles 13(3) and 16(3) \nC6/1/58\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 59 - of the Civil Code are constitutional59. Since this Decision, the Supreme Court has \ncontinued to apply the general principles of civil law directly, for example as grounds for \nholding a contract to be invalid60.

Since this Decision, the Supreme Court has \ncontinued to apply the general principles of civil law directly, for example as grounds for \nholding a contract to be invalid60. I do not see how this Decision supports Mr Alyoshin’s \nposition. \n Lastly, Mr Nahnybida adds at JR/32.4 his opinion that “ creating and executing contrived \ndocuments as well as non-compliance with terms of contracts may not constitute a breach \nof Article 3(1)(2) ” for the purposes of Article 1166. I do not agree. In my view, if for example \na person creates and executes contrived documents with the intent of depriving another \nperson of their property, other than in accordance with law, they could be found to have \nbreached Article 3(1)(2) and to have acted unlawfully for purposes of a tort claim.  \nUnlawfulness: Article 13 of the Civil Code (“Article 13”) \n The experts’ point of agreement regarding Article 13 is at JR/33. There are four areas of \ndisagreement concerning my evidence at Beketov 8/81-88 regarding the abuse of rights rule \nat Articles 13(2) and 13(3) of the Civil Code, and its potential relevance to establishing the \nunlawfulness of conduct for purposes of a tort claim. \nScope of the abuse of rights rule \n First, we disagree as to the scope of the prohibition against abuses of right (JR/34).  \n In my view, the types of conduct that may be treated as an abuse of rights are not fixed and \nthe rule is of broad application.  \n Mr Alyoshin, on the other hand, states that “ the scope of the prohibition against an abuse of \nright rule must be inferred from the available court practice ” (JR/34.2). This suggests that \nthe scope of the rule’s application should be defined by the cases in which the rule has \nalready been applied. But this approach ignores that, as noted at Beketov 8/86, the abuse \nof rights rule has developed recently under Ukrainian law and is still evolving. It also seems \ncontrary to Mr Alyoshin’s own evidence that “ the scope of the concept has been left \ndeliberately vague and the doctrine must be applied on a case by case basis ”, and to the \nacademic article he relies upon: “ the concept should be flexible enough to enable the court \nto take account of all the circumstances of each case and to balance the interests of the \n59  The decision of Constitutional Court that the provisions in Articles 13(3) and 16(3) of the Civil Code are \nconstitutional is binding, final and non-appealable. \n60  See, for example, the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 26 May 2021, case No. 727/2525/20. \nC6/1/59\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 60 - parties in a situation so atypical that it could not have been reasonably foreseen … ” \n(Alyoshin 1/204). \n Furthermore, the available court practice supports my view as it describes the abuse of rights \nrule in terms reflecting its wide, general applicability. I refer to the Supreme Court \nResolutions quoted at Beketov 8/83-85 as well as the more recent Supreme Court \nResolution of 11 November 2021 in case No. 910/8482/18, which described the abuse of \nrights rule in the following terms, indicating for example that an abuse of rights may be found \nwhenever a person has exercised a right for a malicious or otherwise abusive purpose: \n“76.4. In its decision of 28 April 2021 No. 2-r (II)/2021 in case No. 3-95/2020 (193/20), the \nConstitutional Court of Ukraine recognised that Article 13, part 3 and Article 16, part 3 of the \nCivil Code of Ukraine do not contradict Article 58, part 2 of the Constitution of Ukraine, and \nstated that in assessing the proportionality of the provision at Article 13, part 3 of the Code, \nthe Constitutional Court of Ukraine found that the prohibition of actions that a participant in \ncivil relations may commit with the intention of causing harm is a phrase that develops Article"}

At the same time, \nthe phrase “as well as abuse of rights in other forms”, which is also contained in Article 13, \npart 3 of the Code […] is essentially a means of generalising several phenomena to avoid \nthe need for a complete or exclusive list. In exercising a right of ownership, including by \nconcluding a contract or other transaction, a person must take into account that the exercise \nof freedom of contract as one of the principles of civil law is inextricably linked with other \nlimits on the exercise of civil rights, including rights of ownership, that are prescribed by the \nCode and other laws. The setting of limits on the exercise of property rights and freedom of \ncontract in the Code or other laws does not contradict the requirements of the Constitution \nof Ukraine, except in situations where there is no lawful (legitimate) purpose [for this] or \nwhen disproportionate legal measures are used. Since Article 13, part 3 and Article 16, part \n3 of the Code are intended to encourage participants in civil relations to exercise their civil \nrights reasonably and in good faith, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine concluded that this \nis a lawful (legitimate) goal.\n76.5. Abuse of rights and the use of private law tools contrary to purpose are manifested \nwhen: \n- a person (persons) “used the right for a malicious [purpose]”; \n- there are negative consequences (of various manifestations) for other persons (negative \nconsequences are when other persons find themselves in a certain condition and their rights \nare directly linked to the rights of the person who abuses them; this condition does not satisfy \nthose other persons; there are insufficient facts and/or conditions for them to exercise their \nrights; the occurrence of these facts/conditions directly depend on the actions of the other \nperson [i.e the abuser]; the other person may or may not be in a specific legal relationship \nwith the person who “suffers” from the abuse of his right); \n- the legal status of the person/persons is taken into account (the person is in a legal \nrelationship and as a participant in that relationship has an idea not only of the scope of its \nC6/1/60\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 61 - rights but also of the rights of other participants in this legal relationship and the procedure \nfor their acquisition and implementation; the person is not in this relationship for the first time \nor the legal relationship is long-term, or it is a party to other similar legal relationships). \n76.6. The Court emphasises that transactions entered into by parties to civil relations must \nhave a specific legal and factual purpose, which must not be manifestly unlawful or in bad \nfaith. The transaction may not be used by participants in civil relations to avoid payment of \ndebt or enforcement of a court decision. \n[…] \n77.1.

As a result, in the \nopinion of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, a participant in civil relations, if necessary, \nwith the assistance of appropriate consultation will be able to reasonably predict which of \nhis actions may be further treated as unfair and violating civil rights, including abuse of rights, \nand what legal consequences of such actions may be ”.\nIntent to harm property interests of a contracting counterparty \n Secondly, we disagree as to whether the specific act of entering into a contract with the \nintention and/or effect of harming property interests of the counterparty (as opposed to a \nthird party) can amount to an abuse of right (JR/35).  \nC6/1/61\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 62 -  I believe it can, and in support I would refer to: \n what I have said above, with reference to court practice, regarding the flexibility and \ngeneral applicability of the abuse of rights rule; \n Article 11(2) of the Civil Code, which is clear that civil law rights include rights arising \nfrom contracts and other transactions;  \n Article 13(2) of the Civil Code, which is the article that addresses abuse of rights, and \nwhich expressly states that “ [a] person shall exercise its civil [law] rights within the \nbounds granted him by contract or the law ”; and \n Resolutions of the Supreme Court indicating that certain provisions in contracts \nbetween a bank and its customers requiring the latter to make commission payments \nwere an abuse of right:  \n“According to Article 13(3) of the Civil Code of Ukraine, actions of a person committed \nwith the intention of harming another person, as well as abuse of rights in other forms, \nare not allowed.  \n[…] \nBased on the content of the specified norms, the provision of funds under the concluded \ncredit agreement in accordance with Article 1054 (1) of the Civil Code of Ukraine is the \nobligation of the bank, the fulfillment of such an obligation cannot be conditioned by any \ncounter payment from the borrower. Since providing a loan is the bank’s obligation \nunder the loan agreement, such action as providing a financial instrument or monitoring \nloan arrears is not an independent service that is ordered and payable by the borrower \nin favor of the bank.

I also am not aware \nof any such case, but for the reasons given above this is far from dispositive; the abuse of \nrights rule is recently developed and still evolving, and where the Supreme Court has \nconsidered the rule it has described it in general terms of potentially wide applicability whilst \nmaking clear that Articles 13(2) and (3) (along with Articles 3(1)(2) and (3)(1)(6)) enshrine \ngeneral principles that are of direct application, i.e. they create substantive rights and \nobligations. I consider the other experts’ position (that an abuse of rights cannot amount to \nunlawful conduct for purposes of Article 1166) to be contrary to principle. \nAbuse of rights by way of omission \n Fourthly, we disagree as to whether an abuse of rights can occur by way of omission (JR/37). \nI believe it can, for the reasons set out at Beketov 8/89-92, including the Supreme Court’s \nstatement in case No. 914/692/18 that “ these actions are abuse of right in the form of \ninaction ”. Mr Alyoshin says that he disagrees with me, but without giving any reason. \nC6/1/63\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 64 - Unlawfulness: acts which constitute criminal conduct \n The experts’ points of agreement under this sub-heading are at JR/38 (although, as I explain \nfurther below, I believe it is possible to identify a further, important point of agreement in the \nother experts’ statements).  \nThe unlawfulness (for purposes of a tort claim) of embezzlement and misappropriation \n At JR/39, the experts disagree as to whether embezzlement or misappropriation, as defined \nunder criminal law, are also “ in themselves ”unlawful as a matter of civil law.  \n I consider that they are, and I find Mr Alyoshi"}

First, he states at Alyoshin 1/231, without any reference to authority, that in \nUkraine, “ the misappropriation of property … is not, in itself and without more, contrary to \nany provision of civil law ”. I disagree; I consider it self-evident that a person who \nmisappropriates someone else’s property has: \n acted contrary to inter alia the general principles enshrined at Articles 3(1)(2) and \n3(1)(6) of the Civil Code, Article 3 of the ECHR (see paragraph 147(c) above) and Article \n41 of the Constitution62 (Ukraine’s highest law); and  \n unlawfully caused harm, such that unless they can show that they acted without fault, \nthey will have committed an actionable tort. \n At Alyoshin 1/232-235, Mr Alyoshin makes the related assertion that, under Ukrainian law, \nfraudulent conduct gives rise to a civil remedy in only limited, defined circumstances. I \ndisagree: where fraudulent conduct causes harm, a tort claim under Article 1166 is an \navailable route for the victim to obtain compensation. Mr Alyoshin’s attempt to limit remedies \nfor fraud to certain pre-defined categories also ignores the Supreme Court’s repeated \nguidance that the general principles of civil law, enshrined in Articles 3 and 13 of the Civil \nCode, are directly actionable and may be relied upon “ in the absence of specific legal \nprovisions governing the relations at issue ” (see, for example, the cases quoted at \nparagraphs 148 and 155 above and at Beketov 8/77, 79 and 83). \n62  Article 41 of the Constitution of Ukraine contains a number of provisions protecting property rights, \nincluding: “ Everyone shall have a right to own, use and dispose of his/her own property, results of \nintellectual and creative activity ”; and “ Nobody shall be illegally deprived of ownership. Private property \nshall not be violated ”. \nC6/1/64\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 65 - No prior criminal conviction necessary \n Although it is not expressed as a point of agreement in the Joint Report, certain statements \nof the other experts suggest that they agree with me that if the Bank can establish the \nelements of its tort claim in these proceedings, then the absence of a prior criminal conviction \nin respect of the defendants’ conduct underlying that tort claim will not preclude their liability \nin tort.  \n I set out my opinion on this issue at Beketov 8/99-105, where I explained that, in relation to \na tort that is also a crime, “ [i]f the elements of a claim under Article 1166 are made out, then \nthe victim has a claim in tort, whether or not the perpetrator is or may become the subject of \na criminal conviction ”.  \n The other experts’ apparent agreement with me on this point is indicated by the following: \n at JR/39.2, Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida appear to accept that if the elements of the \nBank’s tort claim are made out, the absence of a criminal conviction in respect of the \nalleged tortious conduct would not preclude the defendants’ liability in tort:  \n“39.2 OA and VN disagree: in their view, embezzlement or misappropriation of \nfunds as understood under criminal law are unlawful under the criminal law only (para. \n231 OA; para. 66 VN).

This \nis not because, in such cases, a criminal conviction is a necessary requirement for civil \nliability, but rather is for a number of legal and practical reasons, as follows: \n In the Ukrainian legal system, the investigating authorities are endowed with certain \nexclusive powers that allow them to investigate criminal conduct effectively and collect \nevidence necessary to prove that unlawful actions were committed that caused harm. \nPrivate citizens and entities do not have the same legal mechanisms available to them \nfor the collection of evidence (such as questioning individuals, or carrying out searches), \nand the type of evidence-gathering orders (such as disclosure and search orders) that \nI understand are available to claimants in English civil proceedings are not available in \nUkraine outside the criminal context.  \n As a matter of Ukrainian procedural law, the guilty verdict of a criminal court (that has \nentered into force) will be binding on the civil and commercial courts in subsequent \nproceedings dealing with the legal consequences of the conduct of the guilty person, \nbut only with respect to whether or not the guilty person engaged in the specific alleged \ncriminal conduct (Article 82(6) of the Code of Civil Procedure; Article 75(6) of the Code \nof Commercial Procedure). \n A victim that chooses to bring a civil claim within the context of criminal proceedings, \nrather than in standalone civil proceedings, will not be prejudiced if, in the criminal \nproceedings, the prosecuting authorities fail to prove the commission of a crime to the \n63  For example: (i) at JR/29.2 Mr Aloyshin states that “ entering into a loan with a prior intention of not repaying \nthe money would, in appropriate circumstances, constitute a criminal act. Such conduct would not be \nremediable under tort law independently from a criminal conviction ”; (ii) Nahnybida 3/66 states that “ the \nBank pleads generally improper conduct of the Corporate Defendants – creating and executing contrived \ndocuments – to ‘further’, ‘disguise’ and/or ‘hid[e]’ the alleged misappropriation. In my opinion to rely on \nsuch conduct as unlawful conduct for the purposes of a claim under Article 1166, the Bank would require \na finding by a criminal court of illegality by the Corporate Defendants in so creating and executing the \ndocumentation ”; and (iii) Marchukov 1/41 states th"}

None of these statements are accompanied with any such proviso as \nappears in JR/39.2 and Alyoshin 1/237, as I have highlighted above. \nC6/1/66\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 67 - criminal standard of proof (i.e. beyond reasonable doubt64, as compared to the balance \nof probabilities standard that applies in civil and commercial proceedings65). In such \ncircumstances, the criminal court shall leave the victim’s civil claim undecided (Article \n129 of the Criminal Procedure Code) and the victim may file their claim anew in separate \ncivil proceedings (Article 128(7) of the Criminal Procedural Code; see Beketov 8/100). \nIn its Resolution dated 10 April 2020 in case No. 532/1374/18, the Supreme Court made \nclear that exoneration from criminal liability does not equate to exoneration from civil \nliability for the same conduct:  \n“The obligation to compensate for the damage caused arises from the one who caused \nit, provided that the actions of the latter were unlawful, there is a direct causal \nconnection between them and the damage and the fault of the specified person. The \nabsence of the composition of the crime, for example, in the case of closing the criminal \nproceedings according to the rules of the Criminal Procedure Code of Ukraine does not \nmean the absence of fault for civil liability. At the same time, the decision to close \ncriminal proceedings is evidence that must be examined and evaluated by a court in a \ncivil case in the manner provided by the Code of Civil Procedure of Ukraine ”.\n Therefore, as a matter of practice in Ukraine, where criminal proceedings are pending a \nvictim of crime, especially a crime involving complex financial fraud, will usually bring any \ncivil claim it may have in the context of those criminal proceedings, rather than separately. \nBut, as I have explained at Beketov 8/99-105, the law does permit such civil claims to be \nbrought separately as well and, provided that the four elements of tort liability under Article \n1166 are present, a victim may bring a civil tort claim even if the harm in question was \ncaused by unlawful conduct that is criminally punishable but has not been prosecuted as a \ncrime or if the criminal standard of proof has not been discharged in criminal proceedings. \n Secondly, I would comment as follows on certain points that Mr Alyoshin appears to offer in \nsupport of his general statement at Alyoshin 1/237 that victims of torts that are also crimes \ncannot recover civil damages unless and until there is a criminal conviction (although, as \n64  See Article 17(2) of the Ukrainian Criminal Procedural Code: “ 2. No one shall be required to prove his \ninnocence in the commission of a criminal offense and shall be acquitted unless the prosecution proves \nthe person’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ” \n65  See Article 79 of Ukrainian Commercial Procedural Code: “ 1. The existence of a circumstance referred to \nby a party as the basis of its claims or objections shall be considered proven if the evidence provided in \nsupport of such a circumstance is more probable than the evidence provided to refute it. 2. The issue of \nthe likelihood of evidence to establish the circumstances relevant to the case, the court decides in \naccordance with its inner conviction ”. Under"}

The existence of a circumstance referred to \nby a party as the basis of its claims or objections shall be considered proven if the evidence provided in \nsupport of such a circumstance is more probable than the evidence provided to refute it. 2. The issue of \nthe likelihood of evidence to establish the circumstances relevant to the case, the court decides in \naccordance with its inner conviction ”. Under Article 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the standard of proof \nis ‘sufficiency’: “ Evidence is sufficient if in the aggregate it permits one to conclude that the facts to be \nproven are or are not present. The question of whether evidence is sufficient for a finding of relevant fact \nis decided by the judge in accordance with his or her internal convictions ”.  \nC6/1/67\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 68 - noted above, this general statement is significantly eroded by his apparent acceptance that \nthis is not the case where the elements of a tort claim are made out): \n At Alyoshin 1/236, Mr Alyoshin notes that a civil court cannot make a finding of criminal \nwrongdoing. This is correct – a civil court cannot declare a defendant to be guilty of a \ncrime or impose a criminal punishment – but this is no obstacle to the victim of a tort \nthat is also a crime pursuing a tort claim in the absence of a criminal conviction. The \nsame conduct that a criminal court might find to the criminal standard of proof to \nconstitute the crime of embezzlement or misappropriation under Articles 190 or 191 of \nthe Criminal Code can be found by a civil court to amount to an unlawful infliction of \nharm under the civil standard of proof, and therefore to constitute a tort under Article \n1166.  \n I also note that the elements of various crimes and the elements of their corresponding \ntorts are different, as is the burden of proof. For example: (i) many crimes under the \nCriminal Code require that the accused acted with intent, whereas as a general rule \nnegligence is sufficient to establish fault for the purposes of a tort claim; and (ii) in a tort \nclaim fault is presumed (Article 1166(2) of the Civil Code) and must be disproven by the \ndefendant, whereas in criminal proceedings the burden of proving guilt lies with the \nprosecution (Article 2(2) of the Criminal Code). The finding of a civil court that a \ndefendant has committed a tort results in no criminal conviction, criminal record or \ncriminal punishment, but only permits a remedy of compensatory damages.  \n Further in relation to the different standard of proof in criminal and civil claims, a \nfundamental objection to any suggestion that tort liability can only be imposed on a \nperson who commits a crime if there is a criminal verdict of guilt against that person is \nthat it would effectively impose the criminal standard of proof upon a civil claim. \n I also note that Mr Alyoshin’s description of the Ukrsotsbank  case in footnote 176 at \nAlyoshin 1/236 is materially incomplete. In its Resolution, the Supreme Court concluded \nthat: \n it was premature for the claimant to bring a claim for compensation within the \ncriminal proceedings because those criminal proceedings had been opened but \nnot yet concluded; and \nC6/1/68\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 69 -  the claimant’s separate tort claim failed because “ the plaintiff has not proved all the \ncomponents for imposing civil liability on the defendant for compensation for \nproperty damage in accordance with Article 1166 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, in \nparticular, the fact of causing such harm, the wrongfulness of the defendant’s \nactions and the causal relationship between the harm and such actions has not \nbeen established ”66. \nMr Alyoshin’s case summary refers only to the first of these conclusions and so omits \nthe key point that, despite there being no criminal verdict in respect of the allegedly \n"}

The warrant pursuant to which the property was seized \nwas later cancelled, but Pandeon’s property was not returned and in fact had \ndisappeared from UK Parus’ place of storage. Criminal proceedings were then instituted \nagainst UK Parus’ officials and, in parallel, Pandeon brought a claim in tort against the \nregional police seeking compensation for damages and lost profits (resulting from \nPandeon’s inability to fulfil its obligations to third parties). The Grand Chamber stated \nthat Pandeon’s ability to recover damages in tort did not depend upon a prior criminal \nverdict:  \n“5.30. Regarding the reference in the decision of the Commercial Court of Cassation as \npart of the Supreme Court to an exclusive legal problem in the matter of the independent \nestablishment by the commercial courts of the unlawfulness of the actions of the state \nauthority, the authority of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or the local self-\ngovernment body during the consideration of cases on compensation for damage, the \n66  See the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 28 November 2019, case No. 159/1780/17. \nC6/1/69\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 70 - Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court determines, that the issue of the existence of \ntortious obligations between the parties and civil legal liability for the damage caused is \nin the area of civil legal relations between the victim and the state, which are not \nregulated by the norms of the Code of Criminal Procedure of Ukraine, and the \ncommercial court independently establishes the presence or absence of a civil offense \nthat became the basis for recovery damage, evaluating the evidence provided by the \nparties. \n5.31.

Claiming the need for a preliminary court decision, which should establish the \nillegality of the relevant actions, decisions or inaction of the state body during criminal \nproceedings, as a basis for compensation, the complainant did not take into account \nthat the disputed tortious legal relationship arose in connection with the loss of \ntemporarily seized property, that is, through actions that are not mediated by CCP \n[Code of Criminal Procedure] regulation ”.\n The above case was considered by the Supreme Court in case No. 523/12321/15-ts, \nwhich concerned the death of an individual after a"}

Criminal proceedings were initiated and, in parallel, the \ndeceased’s husband sued the municipal body in tort. The first instance court dismissed \nthe husband’s tort claim as premature in view of the ongoing criminal proceedings, but \nthe Supreme Court in its Resolution dated 10 July 2019 overturned the rulings below \nand remanded the case for reconsideration, reiterating that a criminal verdict would not \nbe a pre-requisite for tort liability: \n“In the resolution dated March 12, 2019 in case No. 920/715/17, proceedings No. 12-\n199gs18, the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court came to the conclusion that the \nissue of the existence of tort obligations between the parties and civil legal liability for \ndamage caused is in the area of civil legal relations between the victim and the state, \nwhich are not regulated by the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code of Ukraine, \nand the court is to independently establish the presence or absence of a civil offence \nthat becomes the basis for the recovery of damages, evaluating the evidence provided \nby the parties. \nTherefore, asserting the need for a previous court decision or a decision of another \ncompetent body, which should establish the illegality of the relevant actions, decisions \nor inaction of the state body during criminal proceedings, as a basis for compensation \nfor damage, the courts did not take into account that the disputed tortious legal \nrelationship arose due to actions which are not regulated by the Criminal Procedure \nC6/1/70\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 71 - Code of Ukraine, but are regulated by the norms of civil legislation ”67. \n My position is further supported by Supreme Court Resolutions in the sphere of \nbankruptcy law. The Bankruptcy Code grants liquidators the right to bring claims against \ninter alios the founders, participants or shareholders of bankrupt entities who by their \nconduct have brought the entity to insolvency. Such persons may bear subsidiary \nliability for the entity’s obligations, measured by the difference in value between the \nbankrupt’s estate and creditors’ claims68. Bringing a legal entity to bankruptcy is also a \ncriminal offense under Article 219 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, but the Supreme \nCourt has made clear that because there is no requirement expressed in law that \nsubsidiary liability can only be imposed on the founders, participants or shareholders of \nbankrupt entities if there is a criminal verdict against them, therefore liquidators are free \nto pursue such claims in the absence of any such criminal verdict: \n“29. Subsidiary liability in bankruptcy cases is an independent civil law type of liability \nimposed on the founders (participants, shareholders) or other persons, including the \nhead of the debtor, if there is confirmation of the fault of these persons in proving the \nlegal entity (the debtor in the bankruptcy case) to the insolvency. \n30. Since the legislation does not link the possibility of imposing subsidiary liability on \nthird parties with the existence of a verdict in a criminal case against such persons on \nthe establishment of a criminal offense in their actions (inaction), in this case, persons, \nby virtue of a special provision of the Code, are subject to civil liability in the form of joint \nand several recovery ”69. \n Lastly, in relation to the issue of whether the absence of a criminal conviction is any obstacle \nto "}

It is impossible \nto conclude whether a business is a sham or not if there is no criminal verdict to that effect. \nThe Fund did nothing to report the crime (provided for in Article 205 of the Ukrainian Criminal \nCode) to law enforcement agencies ”70. \n Importantly, the Grand Chamber, in overturning the above judgment and granting the bank’s \nclaims, proceeded to establish the presence of all elements of tort liability without concern \nfor the absence of any criminal verdict.  \nRecent developments in the Ukoopspilka Bank case \n Further to my reliance above on the Ukoopspilka Bank case, I consider it necessary to \nupdate the Court on an important development in that case. By Resolution dated 3 August \n2022, the Grand Chamber resolved that, due to “ newly discovered circumstances ”, the case \nshould be re-tried71. The Grand Chamber therefore cancelled its previous Resolution of 25 \nMay 2021, on which I have relied, as well as the lower courts’ decisions, and remanded the \ncase for a new trial, which has yet to take place.  \n The nature of the newly discovered circumstances leading to this result are important to \nconsider. By way of background: by its prior Resolution of 25 May 2021, the Grand Chamber \nfixed the quantum of the defendants’ joint and several liability with reference to the shortfall \n(as alleged by the DGF) in Ukoopspilka Bank’s assets necessary to cover the claims of the \nbank’s creditors, reflecting the basis upon which the DGF, in its claim, had quantified the \nharm caused to the bank72. This shortfall equalled UAH 76,295,559.41, according to a \nregister of claims against Ukoopspilka Bank and a valuation of the bank’s assets, both \n70  Resolution of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court dated 25 May 2021, case No. 910/11027/18, \nUkoopspilka Joint-Stock Bank PJSC v.

In \naddition to that, currently the Applicant has doubts about the credibility of all the calculations \nmade by the Claimant in the case and the evidence it submitted to support his claims. \nPERSON_7 also pointed out that the evidence he mentioned in the application could not \n73  See paragraph 7.43 of the Resolution of 25 May 2021: “ The [lower] courts also found that the bank’s \nliabilities (as per the register of accepted creditors’ claims as approved by the Fund’s Executive Board of \nDirectors Decision No. 168/15 of 20 July 2015 (as amended by the Fund’s Decision No. 1494 of 29 May \n2018)) amounted to UAH 109,660,264.41 and that the appraised (market) value of the bank’s liquidation \nestate (as approved by the Fund’s Executive Board of Directors Decision No. 196/15 of 17 August 2015 \n(as amended by the Fund’s Executive Board of Directors Decision No. 1745 on 21 June 2018)) was UAH \n33,364,705 ”.\n74  For completeness, I note that because (as I stated at Beketov 8/109) the quantification of loss is a question \nof fact, the DGF would have been at liberty to prove the quantum of Ukoopspilka Bank’s loss with reference \nto other factual matters. This is reflected in paragraph 7.61 of the Resolution of 21 May 2021: “ 7.61 If harm \nhas been caused to a bank otherwise than through separately identified acts (omissions) resulting in the \ndestruction of or damage to a specific thing or in the loss of specific income or similar consequences, but \nthrough failure to comply with statutory requirements, to take timely measures to prevent that bank from \nbecoming insolvent, etc, which has led to a reduction in the net assets of that bank and/or a breach of a \nstandard, such as a liquidity standard, and a loss by that bank of its solvency position, then the harm \ninflicted on the bank is estimated by the amount by which the bank’s property is insufficient to satisfy all of \nits creditors’ claims, unless the harm has been proved to be of a greater amount.

In addition to that, the courts did not examine and analyse the \ncomplete register of accepted claims of creditors of PJSC JSB Ukoopspilka in combination \nwith other evidence. \n5.55. The specified newly discovered circumstances are significant, as they are part of \nthe subject of proof in the case, they affect the total amount of damages claimed to be \nrecovered from the Defendants, and the validity of the claims in terms of determining the \namount of damage caused to PJSC JSB Ukoopspilka ”. \n As is clear from the above, the newly discovered circumstances that led to cancellation of \nthe Resolution of 25 May 2021 concerned solely the quantum of the defendants’ liability. \nUnsurprisingly in these circumstances, the Grand Chamber by its Resolution of 3 August \n2022 did not retract or amend any of the guidance contained in its prior Resolution of 25 \nMay 2021 as to how certain rules of law are to be interpreted and/or applied, nor was the \nfirst instance ruling that was overturned by that prior Resolution reinstated. Instead, it simply \ncancelled its prior Resolution whilst giving the following binding75 guidance to the first \ninstance court in relation to the re-trial (at paragraph 5.60):  \n“[d]uring the re-trial of the case, the first instance court should ask the claimant to provide \na full register of accepted creditors’ claims of PJSC JSB Ukoopspilka and assess it in \nconjunction with other evidence attached to the case file, to establish the circumstances \nregarding the repayment of the debt of PJSC JSB Ukoopspilka to the Central State Union \nof Credit Unions (Ukoopspilka) and to provide legal assessment to these circumstances \nbased on the substantive law governing the disputed legal relations ”. \n In my view, the prior Resolution of 25 May 2021 remains a good and proper source of \nguidance, emanating from the Grand Chamber, as to how the provisions of the Civil Code \nand other Laws that were considered by the Grand Chamber are to be interpreted and \n75  Article 310(5) of the Code of Commercial Procedure"}

The experts have since agreed that a breach of such duties “ would amount to \nunlawful conduct for the purposes of a claim under Article 1166 ” (JR/62.1), but for \ncompleteness I note that this conclusion also is supported by: \n the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 7 October 2021 in case No. \n910/12803/18, PJSC Tavryka Bank v Person 2 et al . In this case, the DGF, as \nliquidator of Tavryka Bank, brought claims against the bank’s former executives \nand shareholders under ( inter alia )Articles 1166 and 1190 in respect of their \nunlawful acts and omissions (which involved breaches of their fiduciary duties \nowed under Article 92 of the Civil Code, Article 63 of the JSC Law and Articles 42 \nand 43 of the Law on Banks) that jointly caused the bank’s insolvency. The claim \nfailed on limitation grounds (Tavryka Bank had become insolvent in December \n2012, the DGF was found to have had sufficient knowledge for limitation purposes \nsince September 2013, but its claim was not filed until September 2018), but the \nSupreme Court upheld the first instance court’s judgment that the DGF’s claim \notherwise succeeded on the merits; and \n the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 28 October 2021 in case No. \n910/9851/20, DGF v.

This fully \naccords with my view (see Beketov 8/110), and is an important point of agreement (although \nwe did not specifically identify it as such in the Joint Report). \n My further view is that when resolving this question of fact, the Ukrainian courts will ask \nwhether the harm would have occurred ‘but for’ the conduct in question. Mr Alyoshin and Mr \nNahnybida disagree, insisting that the causal link must be “ direct, necessary and inevitable ” \n(JR/41.2), but I do not think there is much between us. At Beketov 8/111-112, I rely on \nSupreme Court Resolutions stating that the causal link must be “ direct ”, and I also agree \nwith the Supreme Court Resolution cited at Alyoshin 1/250, which makes clear that ‘indirect’ \ncausation will suffice in some circumstances, namely that where person A creates the \nconditions in which person B then causes harm, both may be found to have caused the harm \n(although I would say that the proper analysis is that (i) but for the conduct of A, the harm \nwould not have occurred, and (ii) but for the conduct of B, the harm would not have occurred, \ntherefore both may be liable): \n“Where the unlawful conduct which created the specific possibility of causing harm turns it \ninto reality only in combination with the unlawful conduct of third persons, a legally significant \ncausal link must be established both with the conduct which created the specific possibility \n(the conditions for causing harm), and with th"}

The existence of damage consists in any loss, in full or partial depreciation, of things \nprotected by law. In particular, the destruction and damage of property may consist in the \ncomplete loss of property and in reducing its value, including due to changes in the \ncharacteristics of the property. … \n66. The manifestations of harm can be varied and cannot be determined from an exhaustive \nlist. For example, a bank may suffer losses through the alienation of property at reduced \nprices, the acquisition of property at inflated prices, the provision of banking services at \nbelow-market prices, the provision of risky loans or other risky or unprofitable operations, \nand so on. At the same time, wrongful acts or inaction, infliction of damage and detection of \nits extent may not coincide in time. For example, individual wrongful acts or inaction or a \ncombination of such acts or inaction may result in a loss of liquidity by the bank in the future. \nThe loss of solvency of a bank that was previously solvent may, in itself indicate that the \nbank has suffered damage (see also, mutatis mutandis the resolution of the Grand Chamber \nof the Supreme Court of 25 May 2021 in case No. 910/11027/18 (proceedings No. 12-\n185г19, para. 7.56)). Acquisition by the bank of indicators of insolvency due to actions or \ninaction of bank officials, owners of significant participation, other persons related to the \nbank may in itself indicate damage to the bank also because the loss of ability to conduct \nbanking activities precludes the bank’s income from it, and the bank’s property cannot be \nused as a single property complex intended for banking activities, which reduces the value \nof the bank’s property and, as a rule, entails its object-by-object sale. \n67. At the same time, illegal acts and inaction on the part of bank officials, its controllers and \nother related parties may cause damage to the bank. It is the bank that suffers losses in the \nform of unearned income or a decrease in the market value of its property (including due to \nloss of business reputation, in the result of which business practice suffers, normal business \nrelations with depositors, borrowers and other creditors and debtors are lost) as a single \nproperty complex) ”. \n I would also refer to the Resolution dated 25 November 2020 in case No. 439/1127/18-ts, in \nwhich the Supreme Court indicated that if the unlawful conduct is the “ main reason ” for the \nharm, this is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of causation: “ As for the content of the \ncausal relationship, it lies in the fact that the committed unlawful act is the main reason that \nled to the infliction of moral harm83“.

The case concerned an unlawful decision of a local \ncouncil to preclude the claimant for eight years from access to a land plot belonging to him, \nwhich was alleged to have caused him stress and disappointment which in turn led to \nfrequent conflict and misunderstandings with his daughter, which spoiled relations within the \nclaimant’s family on the basis of which he sought compensation for moral damages. By the \nabove Resolution, the Supreme Court sent the case back for a new trial, and on 18 March \n83  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 25 November 2020, case No. 439/1127/18-ts. \nC6/1/79\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 80 - 2021, the Court of Appeal found the existence of a causal link (a cassation appeal was filed \nand remains pending). In my view, this Resolution illustrates that the Supreme Court does \nnot uniformly refer to a need for a causal link to be ‘direct’, and I consider the criterion of \n‘main reason’ to be broad enough to encompass direct or indirect causation.  \n The real point of disagreement between us regarding causation, however, relates to how \ncausation is established where harm is caused by the joint actions of several persons, giving \nrise to joint and several liability under Article 1190 of the Civil Code. At Beketov 8/191-195, \nI explained (with reference to supporting court practice) that the criterion of jointly caused \nharm is determined by asking whether the tortfeasors’ acts when taken together caused the \nharm. This issue is addressed separately starting at paragraph 229 below. For now, I note \nthat Article 1190 was not at issue in any of the authorities on causation that are relied upon \nat Alyoshin 1/250-255 and Nahnybida 3/87. \nHarm (and related issues) \n The experts’ points of agreement are at JR/42-43. There are several areas of disagreement. \nEffect of miscellaneous assumed facts \n First, JR/44 records that Mr Alyoshin and I disagree as to whether it makes any difference \nto the Bank’s claim that: \n the Unreturned Prepayments were made to the Defendant Suppliers by the Borrowers, \nnot by the Bank; \n the Borrowers incurred liabilities to repay the amounts drawn down on the Relevant \nLoans, with interest; and/or \n the monies received by the Defendant Suppliers were not the same monies (in the \nproprietary sense) that were transferred by the Bank to the Borrowers.  \n At Beketov 1/114-117 and 123-127 I explained why the Bank’s tort claim is unaffected by \nany of these considerations. As recorded at JR/44.2, Mr Alyoshin, whilst not agreeing with \nme on any of these points, has not given any reasons for his contrary view, instead stating \nthat he “ will address these points in his supplemental report ”. In these circumstances, I am \nnot in a position to comment on Mr Alyoshin’s position, nor will I be until I receive his \nsupplemental report. \nC6/1/80\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 81 - Assessment of harm in the context of a tortious loan recycling scheme: use of Relevant Loans \n There are two areas of disagreement relating to the assessment of harm in the context of a \ntortious ‘loan recycling’ scheme, by which I mean a scheme involving successive fraudulent \nloans whereby later loans are used to (purportedly) repay earlier loans in order to prevent \nor delay detection of the fraud. \n First, JR/45 records our disagreement as to whether it makes any difference to the Bank’s \ntort claim if the funds received by a particular Borrower under a particular Relevant Loan \nwere circulated back to the Bank to repay earlier loans84.  \n At Beketov 8/128-136, I set out the re"}

It appears that Mr Alyoshin agrees with me, because he says \nat JR/45.2 that he “ agrees ” that “ the Bank’s loss caused by non-repayment of Relevant \nLoans would not be reduced in these circumstances ”. However, he goes on to say that if a \nclaim in tort arises in respect of a Relevant Loan which has been repaid “ then the use to \nwhich the Relevant Loan has been put would also need to be taken into account in assessing \nthe Bank’s loss ”. I find this assertion by Mr Alyoshin difficult to understand, in particular what \nhe means by “ taken into account ”. I also do not understand why he is making his answer to \nthis issue (about the use of funds obtained under the Relevant Loans) conditional on a \ndifferent issue (as to the impact of purported repayment of the Relevant Loans). Mr Alyoshin \ndoes not explain why his answer would differ, and it therefore remains wholly unclear if Mr \nAlyoshin disagrees with what I said at Beketov 8/128-136 and, if so, for what reason.  \n84  At Beketov 8/134, I stated that I had been unable to find a reported Ukrainian case involving “ a fraud \ninvolving loans being used to repay earlier loans ”. In the course of preparing this report, I have identified \nthe Bank Tavryka  case (described at paragraph 184(a)(i) above) as such a case. Unlike in the present \nproceedings, however, the Supreme Court in the Bank Tavryka  case did not conduct (because it did not \nneed to conduct) any analysis of what harm was caused to the bank by any particular unlawful act or series \nof loans, because the DGF’s claim on behalf of Tavryka Bank against its former management was \nquantified by reference to the total amount of creditors’ claims that, according to the DGF, were outstanding \nagainst the bank and could not be satisfied out of the bank’s available assets. \nC6/1/81\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 82 - Assessment of harm in the context of a tortious loan recycling scheme: purported repayment of \nRelevant Loans \n Secondly, at JR/46 Mr Alyoshin and I disagree as to whether it makes any difference to the \nBank’s tort claim if a particular Relevant Loan was purportedly repaid from funds advanced \nby the Bank under other (also unlawfully procured) loans.  \n At Beketov 8/137-141, I set out the reasons for my view (as summarised at JR/46.1) that \nthis would be irrelevant to the Bank’s tort claim. Nothing that Mr Alyoshin has said in support \nof his contrary view has changed my mind, in particular: \n Alyoshin 1/129-131 proceeds on an incorrect basis, as he assumes that the Relevant \nLoans are lawful and in fact created valid contractual repayment obligations. But for the \npurpose of determining whether the purported repayment of the Relevant Loans has \nany effect on the Bank’s claim, it is necessary to assume that the Bank’s claims are \nmade out. From this starting point, in my view: \n the purported repayment of the Relevant Loans using funds derived from inter alia \nthe Intermediary/New Loans did not discharge any contractual repayment \nobligations (as Mr Alyoshin suggests) because if the Relevant Loans are void as \nalleged by the Bank then they created no contractual obligations which could be \ndischarged; \n the issue is instead whether tho"}

In summary, in this \nscenario, there would be an earlier misappropriation and a later misappropriation, both \nof which involved unlawful (and tortious) conduct and both of which caused loss in the \namount of the funds misappropriated less any genuine recovery by the victim. In that \nC6/1/82\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 83 - scenario, the victim could sue in respect of either misappropriation, but would not be \npermitted to recover in respect of both (i.e. ‘double recover’);  \n the point made at Alyoshin 1/132-134 is that it is wrong for the Bank’s pleadings to \ndescribe the purported repayments of the Relevant Loans as “ invalid ”, because under \nUkrainian law validity/invalidity is a concept that applies “ specifically to transactions ”, \nnot payments. Whilst I agree that, under Ukrainian law, the concept of ‘invalidity’ applies \nto void or voidable transactions, and the authorities that Mr Alyoshin relies upon \ncharacterise payments between a bank and its customer not as transactions but as \nexecutions of underlying transactions (i.e. the bank’s contracts with its customers), in \nmy view Mr Alyoshin has misunderstood what it means to describe the purported \nrepayments of the Relevant Loans as “ invalid ”. I refer in this regard to what I said about \nthese purported repayments at Beketov 8/137-141. There, I did not suggest that \npurported repayments of Relevant Loans could be invalid in the manner that the \nRelevant Loans themselves could be. Instead, I explained my view that where such \nrepayments are made using funds referable to other unlawful lending, those \nrepayments would not operate to reduce the Bank’s tortious loss caused via the \nmechanism of the Relevant Loans. This is what I understand the Bank’s pleadings to \nmean when they describe those repayments as “ invalid ”;  \n Alyoshin 1/135 states that because the Bank, pre-nationalisation (i.e. whilst still owned \nand controlled by the First and Second Defendants) accepted the purported repayments \nof the Relevant Loans as “ discharging liabilities of the Borrowers equivalent to the \noutstanding balance of the Relevant Loans ”, it is “ therefore impossible for the Bank to \ncontend that the liabilities of the Borrowers in respect of the Relevant Loans are \nsomehow still outstanding ”. This statement is made without reference to any authority \nor legal principle, however, and it also appears to proceed on the basis that the Relevant \nLoans were lawful and created valid liabilities for the Borrowers that were then \ndischarged.

To the extent that Mr Alyoshin seeks to apply the doctrine of venire contra \nfactum proprium in respect of actions taken by the Bank prior to its nationalisation and \ndiscovery of the Misappropriation, then his position would appear to be akin to that \ntaken by Mr Nahnybida in saying (at Nahnybida 3/220.6) that because the Bank did not \nallege that the Relevant Supply Agreements were void in 2014 (during the proceedings \nbrought by the Borrowers against the Defendant Suppliers), it cannot do so now. I \nresponded to Mr Nahnybida’s position in this regard at paragraph 63 above, and would \nC6/1/83\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 84 - repeat that response in respect of this (or any other) suggestion that the Bank cannot \ntake action now that contradicts action it took prior to its nationalisation and discovery \nof the Misappropriation; \n Alyoshin 1/136 notes the absence of court practice that would directly support my view \nas to how purported repayments in a loan recycling scheme should be analysed for \npurposes of identifying and quantifying tortious loss. Equally, however, I am not aware \nof any authority which would support a conclusion that is contrary to my analysis. In any \nevent, I acknowledged this absence of authority at Beketov 8/139, noting that it is not \nsurprising that the Ukrainian courts have not had to conduct an analysis of tort liability \nin the context of a loan recycling scheme. I expressly based my analysis, therefore, on \nestablished legal principles;  \n Alyoshin 1/138 expresses concern that my analysis would result in potential double \nrecovery, but I accounted for this at Beketov 8/137-141 and in my experience courts \nhave no difficulty ensuring that claimants do not double recover. Situations in which \ndouble recovery could in theory occur are considered regularly by the courts, for \nexample in cases where a primary debtor’s obligation has been secured by another, or \nin any other case where joint and several liability for an obligation arises, but court \npractice shows that the mere existence of a risk of double recovery will not operate as \na bar to a claimant pursuing multiple claims85. However, where a claimant’s debt has \nbeen settled or his violated right made whole by a particular obligor, then any other \nperson against whom the claimant pursues a claim in respect of that same debt or \nviolated right will have a complete defence to that claim. If an unscrupulous claimant, \nhaving recovered a debt, proceeds to sue another person for the same debt, the \n85  For example, the entry of judgment in favour of a lender against a borrower for an unpaid debt will not \nprevent the lender from enforcing against its security. See, for example, Resolution of the Supreme Court \ndated 29 August 2019, case No. No. 921/38/16-г/3: “38. The Supreme Court notes that the existence of \nthe court decision to collect a debt from the debtor in favour of the creditor under the loan agreement shall \nnot constitute ground for termination of the debtor’s monetary obligation and termination of the mortgage \nand does not deprive the creditor of the right to satisfy its claims under the principal obligation by applying \nfor foreclosure on the subject of the mortgage in the manner prescribed by law.

No authority or legal principle \nis referred to in support of this suggestion, with which I disagree. It would create a \nperverse incentive for the tortfeasor, who could extinguish his tortious liability for that \nmost recent fraudulent loan by committing yet another tort and using the proceeds \nthereof purportedly to repay the loan that the victim had been preparing to sue upon (or \nhad already sued upon), forcing the victim to start all over again. This would be contrary \nto principle and I believe my analysis at Beketov 8/140 should be preferred; and \n Alyoshin 1/141 suggests that my approach, which requires determination of whether \nfunds used to reduce loss caused by unlawful lending are themselves referable to other \nunlawful lending (see Beketov 8/137), would lead to “ serious commercial uncertainty ” \nbecause Ukrainian law “ does not have a defined concept of ‘illegitimate’ lending ”. \nHowever: \n I understand the term “ illegitimate ”lending (used by the Bank in its pleadings) \nmeans “ unlawful ”lending (the term I use in Beketov 8), i.e. lending that is contrary \nto law, and I do not consider that the Ukrainian courts or commercial persons would \nhave difficulty understanding and applying this term; and \n more generally, I do not see how “ commercial uncertainty ” is a relevant \nconsideration in circumstances where a person is the victim of multiple torts, each \ncommitted in order to hide the loss caused by the former tort (as with a loan \nrecycling scheme). It seems to me that the victim’s situation unavoidably will remain \nuncertain until the torts are fully investigated and issues of liability and loss \nanalysed and determined by the court, and I do not see how considerations of \ncommerciality would or could apply in priority to upholding the principles of \nprotecting victim’s property rights and ensuring full compensation for loss. \nC6/1/85\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 86 - Competition of claims \n Competition of claims issues are addressed generally in Section H below, but under this \nsub-heading in the Tort section of the Joint Report there is one related area of disagreement \nrecorded, at JR/47.  \n Our disagreement is framed as to whether, assuming the Relevant Loans are void, the \nBank’s proper remedy is a claim under Article 216 of the Civil Code for re"}

Mr Alyoshin considers that this \nis the Bank’s proper claim, asserting that “ the existence of contractual relations excludes \ntortious liability ”, even where the contract is void (JR/47.2).  \n As a preliminary point, I note that Mr Alyoshin’s statement of disagreement (JR/47.2) cross-\nrefers to Alyoshin 1/173-179. Those paragraphs, however, address a different competition \nof claims issue, namely whether the Bank’s tort claim against the First and Second \nDefendant could be precluded by any contracts of employment or services between them \nand the Bank. This is addressed below under “Subject 6. Competition of claims”. The issue \nconsidered here is whether the Bank’s tort claim is excluded by the existence of contractual \nrelations between the Bank and the Borrowers.  \n My view is that the Bank’s tort claim is not precluded by the existence of the Relevant Loans \n(whether valid or invalid) between the Bank and Borrowers. Whilst I believe the Bank, on the \nbasis of its allegation that the Relevant Loans are void, would be entitled to make a claim \nagainst the Borrowers under Article 216, it has not done so and, to the extent that the void \nloans were the product of unlawful conduct and caused harm to the Bank, it is also entitled \nto bring a tort claim against any or all of the tortfeasors.  \n At Beketov 8/277, I stated that where multiple causes of action are available to a claimant \narising out of a particular set of facts, the claimant generally is free to choose which to \npursue. I should make clear that this principle is reflected in Article 20(1) of the Civil Code86, \nwhich provides that a person exercises the right to protection at his own discretion. I would \nalso refer in this regard to what the Supreme Court has said in its Resolution of 27 October \n86  Article 20 of the Civil Code provides: “ 1. A person exercises the right to protection at his own discretion. 2. \nNon-fulfilment by a person of the right to protection is not a basis for the termination of civil law, which is \nviolated, except in cases established by law ”. \nC6/1/86\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 87 - 2021 in case No. 752/20739/15-ts, as regards a claimant’s right to choose between multiple \navailable causes of action: \n“The effectiveness of the protection of civil right depends on the nature of the claim against \nthe violator. Determining the type of claim, a person may face the problem when the same \nillegal actions give rise to different civil law claims for the same subject. Satisfaction of at \nleast one of them deprives the opportunity to bring the other. \nThus, there are several ways to achieve the ultimate goal - the restoration of the violated \nright or protection of interest. This phenomenon is called competition claims. \nCompetition of claims, if interpreted literally, is a competition of subjective civil rights (rights \nof claim against the violator) that exist in the framework of civil relations that are being \nprotected (constitute the content of the obligations that are being protected) and can be \nrealised in courts resulting in the use of appropriate methods protection of rights or interests. \nThe meaning of such competition is that the plaintiff has the opportunity to choose a more \nadvantageous claim and overcome the restrictions imposed on another claim which is based \non the same facts. \nIn the case of competition, there is an atypical situat"}

The realisation of one of these rights leads to the termination of the other, \nbecause the interest implied by it is fully satisfied through the exercise of the other competing \nright.  \nCompetition of lawsuits exists where several lawsuits are united by a common legal interest \nfor all of them (de eadem re), which is satisfied in respect of one of them, which eliminates \neo ipso (consequently) all others as pointless ”87. \n Another problem with Mr Alyoshin’s position that the Relevant Loans preclude the Bank’s \ntort claim is that I do not consider that the Bank’s relationship with the Borrowers would be \na “contractual relationship ” capable (on Mr Alyoshin’s view) of precluding tort liability. On the \nBank’s case the Relevant Loans are void, and as stated expressly at JR/47 this voidness is \nassumed for purposes of the issue under consideration. As such, the Relevant Loans are of \nno legal effect and so cannot, in my view, give rise to a contractual relationship.  \n Even if the court were to conclude that the Relevant Loans are not void, and that the Bank \nand Borrowers thus had a contractual relationship, in my opinion the Bank’s tort claims still \nwould not relate to any breach of contractual obligation and so could not be precluded on \nthat basis. On the contrary, in relation to each Defendant I am not aware of any contract that \nis said to have existed between it and the Bank (leaving aside any contract of employment \n87  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 27 October 2021 in case No. 752/20739/15-ts. \nC6/1/87\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 88 - or services with the First and Second Defendant, which as noted above give rise to a \ndifferent competition of claims issue that is considered further below), let alone any that is \nclaimed to have been breached. Instead, the Bank’s claim arises from the unlawful conduct \nof the Defendants that, taken together, caused harm to the Bank, giving rise to joint and \nseveral liability under Articles 1166 and 1190 of the Civil Code. In other words, regardless \nof the validity or invalidity of the Relevant Loans, the subject matter of the Bank’s claims \ndoes not arise out of a contractual relationship and is not contractual in nature.  \n I am confident that under Ukrainian law, a remedy in tort is available to a bank that is the \nvictim of a fraudulent lending scheme, and the existence of contracts executed as part of \nthat scheme does not preclude a tort claim or limit the bank to a restitutionary claim under \nArticle 216 of the Civil Code against the purported borrowers. This is well-illustrated by the \nUkrsibbank  case described at Beketov 8/18988, in which a bank successfully brought a claim \nunder Articles 1166 and 1190 against defendants who embezzled funds from the bank \nthrough a fraudulent lending scheme.  \n I would also refer to the Finance and Credit Bank Case , quoted at paragraph 190 above, in \nwhich the Supreme Court described a number of ways in which a bank’s majority \nshareholders can cause tortious harm to a bank, including through means that would involve \nthe bank entering into contracts: “ a bank may suffer losses through the alienation of property \nat reduced prices, the acquisition of property at inflated prices, the provision of banking \nservices at below-market prices, the provision of risky loans "}

The Supreme Court did not suggest that the existence of such \ncontracts would preclude tortious liability. \nFault and Article 614 of the Civil Code as an available defence  \n The experts’ points of agreement regarding the element of fault are at JR/48. One minor \npoint of disagreement is stated at JR/49: whilst the experts all agree that a defendant is \nrelieved from civil liability if he proves that he took all reasonable measures to perform his \nobligations properly; the further gloss that Mr Alyoshin would add is that a “ standard of a \nreasonable person ” applies (JR/49.2).  \n88  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 4 June 2021, case No. 753/21343/14-ts, PJSC Ukrsibbank v. \nPersons 1-8 . \nC6/1/88\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 89 -  Although I do not agree with Mr Alyoshin that a “ reasonable person ” standard is recognised \nand applied by the Ukrainian courts (and I note that Mr Alyoshin made this assertion, at \nAlyoshin 1/244-245, without reference to any authority), I do not exclude the possibility that \na particular Ukrainian court might approach the question of whether a defendant took all \nreasonable measures to perform his obligations properly (which the experts agree is the \nrelevant test for establishing absent of fault) by asking what a reasonable person would have \ndone in the defendant’s position.  \nThe Asset Transfer                    \n The experts’ points of agreement regarding the Asset Transfer are at JR/51-52. There are \nthree areas of disagreement \nDo grounds exist to impugn the Mortgages? \n JR/53 concerns whether grounds exist to impugn the validity of the Mortgages. My response \nat JR/53.1 reflects my view that the answer to this question depends on whether the loan \nagreements secured by the Mortgages (which I am instructed include a number of Relevant \nand Intermediary Loans) are invalid, since under Ukrainian law the invalidity of a main \nobligation89 entails invalidity of a derivative obligation. I have addressed the subject of \ninvalidity at length in Beketov 8/Section D, and in Section D above. \n On this issue, Mr Alyoshin appears to express the view, at JR/53.2, that if at the time of the \nAsset Transfer the Bank represented to the mortgagors that the Mortgages were valid, it is \nnow precluded from alleging their invalidity because to do so would demonstrate bad faith \nand violate the doctrine of venire contra factum proprium . I would repeat what I have said at \nparagraph 200(d) above regarding the suggestion that the Bank cannot take action now that \ncontradicts action it took prior to its nationalisation and discovery of the Misappropriation by \nits new management. \nPotential application of the abuse of rights rule \n JR/54 records disagreement arising out of what I said at Beketov 8/144-145 about the \npossibility of the Bank invoking the abuse of rights rule to defend against any claims by \nmortgagors who seek to obtain restitution of Transferred Assets in the event that the \n89  By “ invalidity of the main obligation ” I mean invalidity of the Relevant Loan(s) secured by a Mortgage.

In any event I have already addressed at paragraphs 152 to 156 above my \ndisagreement with Mr Alyoshin as to the scope of potential application of the abuse of rights \nrule.  \nValuing the Transferred Assets \n Thirdly, JR/55 records Mr Alyoshin’s disagreement with what I have said at Beketov 8/146-\n160 regarding the correct approach for determining the value of any Transferred Assets that \nthe Bank ultimately retains if its tort claim succeeds (for purposes of reducing the amount of \nthe Bank’s loss), as well as what I said at Beketov 8/161-162 regarding whether sale and/or \nrental proceeds derived from the Transferred Assets should be applied to reduce the Bank’s \nloss. My key conclusion was that the Bank’s loss should be reduced by the true value of the \nTransferred Assets rather than by any inflated value recorded in the Mortgages or in the \nBank’s transactional data, and that this should be so regardless of whether the Mortgages \nare valid or invalid.  \n Mr Alyoshin agrees that if the Mortgages are invalid, the valuations associated with them \nare not binding on the parties (Alyoshin 1/150). He does not expressly agree with my view \nthat the assets’ true value would be determinative, but nor does he offer any alternative \napproach.  \n If the Mortgages are valid, however, Mr Alyoshin’s view is that those valuations will be \nbinding on the parties unless and until they are set aside by a court on the Bank’s application \nagainst the mortgagors (Alyoshin 1/150; JR/55.3). I disagree, for the reasons set out at \nBeketov 8/151-159. As Mr Alyoshin has not addressed those reasons, I have nothing to add \nat this stage. \nJoint and several liability\n The experts’ points of agreement under this sub-heading are set out at JR/56, 57 and 60. \nThere are three areas of disagreement. \nC6/1/90\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 91 - Application to persons who would be “accomplices” in a criminal context \n First, the experts disagree as to whether the rules of Ukrainian civil law on joint and several \nliability operate similarly to the rules of criminal law on complicity (JR/58).  \n I have never myself sought to draw any comparison between the two, but as this is how the \nissue is framed in the Joint Report, in the following paragraphs I will explain: \n what the criminal rules of complicity are; and \n why I consider them to be wholly irrelevant to the Bank’s tort claim, notwithstanding \nthat, on the facts of a particular case, it might be said that the application of Article 1190 \n(in conjunction with Article 1166) could give rise to a similar result to the extent that joint \nand several liability in tort is imposed upon a person who could be described as an \n‘accomplice’ in a criminal context. \n The Criminal Code of Ukraine defines the concept of complicity in a criminal offense as the \nintentional joint participation of several entities in the commission of an intentional criminal \noffense90. The types of person who may be complicit in a crime, in addition to the perpetrator, \nare defined by their roles, thus: \n an “ organiser ” is a person who organises the commission of the crime, manages its \npreparation, and/or finances it; \n an “ instigator ” is a person who persuades the perpetrator to commit a criminal offense; \nand \n an “ accomplice ” is a person who, by their advice, instructions, pro"}

Accomplices are not subject to criminal liability for an act committed \nby the perpetrator, if it was not covered by their intent92. \n90  Article 26 of the Criminal Code. \n91  Article 27 of the Criminal Code.  \n92  Article 29 of the Criminal Code.  \nC6/1/91\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 92 -  The Criminal Code also distinguishes between the commission of a criminal offense by a \ngroup of persons, a group of persons acting by prior agreement, and an organised group or \na criminal organisation93.  \n The above provisions of Ukrainian criminal law are wholly separate from the rules governing \njoint and several liability in tort for persons whose joint acts or omissions cause harm. Quite \nobviously, Article 1190 (applied in conjunction with Article 1166) is not an exact analogue \nfor the rules of complicity under the criminal law; inter alia  the definitions of who is caught \nby the two sets of rules differ, there is a different subjective element for liability (fault versus \nintention), and a different standard of proof (balance of probabilities versus beyond \nreasonable doubt94). In my view, it is also clear that the criminal rules on complicity are \nwholly irrelevant to the Bank’s tort claim (and I note again that it is only the defendants’ \nexperts that have raised them for consideration).  \n The lack of equivalence between the two sets of rules, however, does not mean that Article \n1190 (in conjunction with Article 1166) is incapable of operating similarly to the concept of \ncomplicity on the facts of any particular case. As described more fully at Beketov 8/184-189, \nArticle 1190 can be (and has been) applied to allow a person to seek full compensation, on \na joint and several basis, from all members of a group who have conspired to cause an \nindivisible harm to that person by their separate actions. Depending on the facts, this could \ninclude a person who in a criminal context would be described as organising, instigating, \nabetting, acquiescing or acting as an accomplice for the other person(s) whose conduct \nconsists of the criminal act (which simultaneously may constitute unlawful conduct for the \npurposes of a tort claim). Whether or not joint and several liability could be imposed upon \nsuch person under Article 1190 would not, of course, depend on whether they satisfy any \ndefinitional requirements of the Criminal Code, but on whether the requirements of Article \n1190 are met (i.e. whether the separate, unlawful actions or omissions of the individual \ntortfeasors are (i) interconnected, (ii) cumulative, and/or (iii) motivated by the same intent, \nand taken together caused a single (indivisible) harm to the claimant).  \n Mr Marchukov (with whom I understand the other experts agree) accepts at Marchukov 1/40 \nthat Article 1190 is “ perfectly suited ” for cases involving “ harm inflicted by a crime committed \nby several accomplices ”, and so it is puzzling to me why he (and the other experts) do not \n93  Article 28 of the Criminal Code. \n94  See paragraph 172(c) above. \nC6/1/92\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 93 - agree that, on the facts of a particular case, Article 1190 can operate similarly to the criminal \nrules on complicity stated above.

Their contrary view appears to be that because there is no \nequivalence between the two sets of rules, therefore Article 1190 cannot be applied so as \nto impose (civil) liability on a person in circumstances where the rules on complicity would \nimpose criminal liability on that person (JR/58.2). That proposition does not make sense to \nme. Article 1190 can be applied in any circumstances where its requirements are satisfied, \nand just because the two sets of rules are different does not mean that they cannot both \ngive rise to liability in relation to a particular set of facts.  \n Marchukov 1/39-42 suggests that Mr Marchukov’s disagreement with me on this issue may \narise because he does not believe that the conduct of a person who in a criminal context \nwould be described as organising, instigating, abetting, acquiescing or acting as an \naccomplice for the other person(s) whose conduct consists of the criminal act, can be \ndeemed unlawful for purposes of a tort claim, and that a criminal verdict is a “ precondition ” \nfor imposing civil liability upon them. This view reflects the area of (apparent) disagreement \naddressed at paragraphs 168 to 177 above, as to whether conduct that is criminal can be \nthe subject of a civil claim in the absence of a criminal verdict. For the reasons set out at \nBeketov 8/98-105, and above, I do not agree. \nThe element of causation where harm is caused by several persons acting jointly \n The second area of disagreement, at JR/59, is whether it is a necessary precondition for the \napplication of Article 1190 that all four elements of tort liability under Article 1166 must be \nestablished with respect to each of the co-defendants independently.  \n On closer analysis, this area of disagreement reduces to the single point of whether or not \nwhat I said at Beketov 8/190-195 is correct, namely that where harm is caused by several \npersons acting jointly, the element of causation does not have to be demonstrated in relation \nto the conduct of each of the tortfeasors individually but in relation to their actions/omissions \nwhen taken together. \n The other experts say I am wrong. They say that Article 1190 does not operate so as to \n“circumvent ” any of the necessary elements under Article 1166 (in particular, causation) for \neach individual tortfeasor and does not operate to impose tort liability on a person where \nnone would otherwise exist (JR/59.2). But this misrepresents my position. I do not say that \nthe causation element can be “ circumvented ” for any individual tortfeasor; what I do say is \nC6/1/93\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 94 - that because Article 1190 introduces a criterion of harm caused by joint actions or omissions \n(also known as jointly caused harm)95, the courts can (and do) assess the element of \ncausation for all tortfeasors together. In other words, the tortfeasors are treated as a group \nthat caused harm together, rather than as a collection of individuals each of whom caused \nharm individually, and the element of causation is not “ circumvented ”, rather it is simply \nestablished in a collective manner. \n The other experts’ view, i.e. that even where Article 1190 applies the court must analyse the \nposition of each tortfeasor individually and conclude separately, for each tortfeasor, that that \ntortfeasor’s act or omission caused harm, is flatly contradicted by the court practice referred \nto at Beketov 8/192-193, in particular: \n the Supreme Court’s Resolution of 29 May 2019 in case No. 740/967/16-ts, which \nrepeatedly refers to the concept of ‘joint causation’; and  \n the S"}

In that Resolution, the causative link between \n95  Article 1190 provides; \n“1. Persons by whose joint actions or failure to act harm was caused shall bear joint and several \nresponsibility to the victim. \n2. Upon the application of the victim, a court may determine the responsibility of the persons who jointly \ncaused harm in a participatory share in accordance with the degree of their fault ”. \nC6/1/94\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 95 - the acts and omissions of the senior members of a bank’s management board and \nsupervisory board and the tortious loss suffered by the bank was described as follows: \n“7.73. The courts of previous instance found that each of the defendants during the disputed \nperiod had the status of the management of the bank and was empowered with [the bank] \nofficial’s rights and responsibilities as a person with a high degree of qualification and \nexperience. \n7.74. The above provisions of civil and commercial law presuppose joint and several liability \nof the bodies of the legal entity for damages caused to the legal entity by breach of \nobligations regarding its representation. Members of the supervisory board and the \nexecutive body of the bank are jointly responsible for the activity of the bank as a whole. The \nillegality of their behaviour may consist in the commission of certain actions, and in their \nfailure to commit, ie omission. \n7.75. The [defendants] as managers of the bank with the appropriate degree of qualification \nand experience knew or should have known about the systematic withdrawal of assets from \nthe bank during 2014 by concluding bond purchase and sale agreements. The defendants \ndid not provide any evidence or arguments for taking active action to prevent this process. \n7.76. Thus, the insolvency of the bank is a consequence of both their active actions \n(decision-making, signing agreements aimed at buying bonds) and passive inaction. It does \nnot matter for what amount and what contracts of sale agreed or signed by each of the \ndefendants.\n7.77.

I should \nnote that whilst paragraph 7.77 that I have quoted refers (only) to the claim brought by the DGF under \nArticle 58 of the Law on Banks (which I described at Beketov 8/234-237), and not to its claim under Articles \n1166 and 1190, in my view the Supreme Court’s statement here as to the need to consider the impact \nupon the claimant bank of the actions/omissions of the defendants as a whole applies generally to \nprovisions imposing joint and several liability in relation to tortious conduct. In this regard, I note that \nAlyoshin 1/191, footnote 131, states (in relation to a different Supreme Court Resolution in case No. \n753/23222/15-ts): “ [t]hese observations were made in the context of a claim under Article 58 of the Law \non Banks against a major shareholder in an insolvent bank who was said to have caused its insolvency, \nbut are equally applicable to claims under Article 1166 of the Civil Code ”. I also note that in the Bank \nTavryka  case, discussed at paragraph 184(a)(i) above, the DGF made claims under both Article 58 of the \nLaw on Banks and Articles 1166/1190 and the Supreme Court drew no distinction in the approach to be \ntaken in relation to each, finding that the defendants together caused harm to the bank without making \nspecific reference to any particular provision. \nC6/1/95\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 96 -  The Supreme Court has promoted the same approach to establishing a causative link \nbetween the acts and omissions of a bank’s executives and tortious loss suffered by a bank \nin other cases. For example, in its Resolution dated 28 October 2021 in case No. \n910/9851/20, DGF v. Budkin, Mayeryan, Avramenko and others  (known as the Trust Bank \ncase) the Supreme Court considered a case in which the DGF filed a claim against the \nformer management of Trust Bank, including members of its supervisory board, for damages \ncaused to the bank and its creditors as a result of the bank’s risky credit policy and risky \ncredit operations (for example, issuing unsecured loans and failing to assess borrowers’ \ncredit risk and financial condition) and violations of banking law (for example, failing to \ncomply with mandatory economic standards and other NBU requirements). The Supreme \nCourt said: \n“The above provisions of civil and commercial legislation, as well as special banking \nlegislation in their entirety, in particular Articles 92, 1166 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, the \nsecond part of Article 89 of the Commercial Code of Ukraine, Article 63 of the Law of \nUkraine “On Joint Stock Companies”, Articles 37, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, 58 of the Law of \nUkraine “On Banks and Banking Activities”, part five of Article 52 of the Law of Ukraine “On \nthe System of Guaranteeing Deposits of Individuals” (in the relevant editions of these laws \nin force during the"}

Members of the supervisory board and the bank’s executive \nbody are jointly responsible for the bank’s activities as a whole. The illegality of their \nbehaviour can consist both in the performance of certain actions and in their non-\nperformance, that is, omission. \nTherefore, the insolvency of a bank can be the result of both active actions of participants, \nbank management bodies (decision-making, signing contracts aimed at buying bonds), and \ntheir passive inaction. \nAt the same time, as already noted above in the text of this resolution, the provisions of the \nspecial banking legislation provide that the managers of the bank are persons with the \nappropriate degree of qualification and experience, possess special knowledge and \nexperience, must understand the meaning of their actions performed in the exercise of their \npowers in their positions, and/or of their admitted inaction, as well as the consequences of \nsuch actions/inaction. \nClaims filed by the Fund on the basis of Article 58 of the Law of Ukraine “On Banks and \nBanking Activity” against the owners of significant participation, bank managers, persons \nrelated to the bank must be considered together within the scope of one case. After all, in \nthe case of causing damage to the bank by the actions of its officials, as a result of which \nthe bank became insolvent, who are jointly and severally liable to the bank as members of \nthe management body (bodies), the full composition of the offense can be established only \nthrough a systematic analysis of the entire set of actions or inactions of the officials, including \nthe study of conducted banking operations and their impact on the financial position of the \nbank as a whole. The bank’s operations and their consequences for its solvency cannot be \nC6/1/96\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 97 - considered separately ”.97\n By the above Resolution, the Supreme Court concluded that the lower courts had not \nproperly assessed the evidence as to whether violations of banking law had occurred and \nhad not made findings as to the defendants’ responsibility for such violations (i.e. the lower \ncourts had not conducted a “ systematic analysis of the entire set of actions or inactions of \nthe officials ”). The case was therefore remanded for reconsideration in accordance with the \nSupreme Court’s guidance. A first instance decision on the merits of the DGF’s claims has \nnot yet been given. \n To further support my opinion, I would also refer to the Supreme Court’s Resolution dated \n28 April 2021 in case no. 910/12591/18, Person 1 v DTEK Power Trade LLC and DTEK \nDniproenergo PJSC , in which the claimant, a minority shareholder of Dtek Dniproenergo \nJSC, was squeezed out of its shareholding by the joint actions of (i) Dtek Power Trade, \nwhich made a public proposal to buy-out the shares of the minority shareholders at a below-\nmarket price, and (ii) the Supervisory Board of Dtek Dniproenergo, who approved the below-\nmarket buy-out price. The claimant brought a claim for compensation of damages in the \namount of the difference between the buy-out price of his shares and the market price.  \n In its Resolution, the Supreme Court rejected Dtek Power Trade’s argument that its conduct \ndid not cause the claimant’s loss, and confirmed that i"}

The above is sufficient for the Supreme Court to find as unfounded the conclusion of \nthe courts of previous instances on the absence of all elements of a civil offense, as a \nnecessary condition for imposing a civil liability in the form of compensation of damages on \nthe defendant, as the courts gave an improper legal assessment of the following: \n- by joint actions of the supervisory board of the joint-stock company and the applicants of \nthe [buy-out] claim, the plaintiff suffered damages; \n- there is an illegal conduct of the company in the form of the conduct of its body (supervisory \nboard), which consists in action of approval of the understated market value of shares, which \nis obviously unfair, as well as the applicant’s illegal conduct of non-compliance with Article \n65-1 of the Law of Ukraine “On Joint Stock Companies”, in particular, determining the correct \npurchase price of shares; \n97  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 28 October 2021 in case No. 910/9851/20.  \nC6/1/97\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 98 - - there is a causal link between these actions and losses - the plaintiff’s shares have been \nbought out at an unfair, obviously understated price (he did not receive fair compensation \nfor property that was alienated without his will, in accordance with the law); \n- the defendant has not proved his absence of guilt in causing damages. \n5.21. The Supreme Court rejects the defendant-1’s [DTEK Power Trade LLC] objection that \nin this case there is no such element of the offense as a causal link between the unlawful \nconduct of DTEK Power Trade LLC and the damage caused, and in accordance with the \nplaintiff’s grounds, the appropriate defendant is JSC DTEK Dniproenergo... \n5.22. The Supreme Court notes that the market value of the shares was approved by the \ncompany’s supervisory board. At the same time, the court also takes into account that the \njoint-stock company is under the control of DTEK Power Trade LLC, which together with its \naffiliates owns the dominant controlling stake; the squeeze-out procedure was carried out in \nthe interests of the latter; the members of the supervisory board who approved the price are \nrepresentatives of the majority shareholder; the applicant did not comply with the actions \nprovided for in Article 65 -1 of the Law of Ukraine “On Joint Stock Companies”. \n5.23. Therefore, in this case, the plaintiff suffered damages as the result of the interrelated \njoint actions of the supervisory board of the company and the applicant of the [buy-out] claim \nwith the unity of intent - the purchase of shares from the plaintiff at a reduced price. \nAccording to Part 1 of Article 1190 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, persons whose joint actions \nor omissions caused damage are jointly and severally liable to the victim. \n5.24. According to Part 1 of Article 543 of the Civil Code of Ukraine in the case of joint and \nseveral liability of debtors (joint and several debtors) the creditor has the right to demand \nperformance of the obligation in part or in full from all debtors together as well as from any \nof them separately. \n5.25. In view of the above, DTEK Power Trade LLC is a proper defendant in the case. \n The Supreme Court’s Resolution dated 6 July 2022, in case No. 906/308/20, JSC \nUkrsibbank v Person 1 and Novotex-M LLC  provi"}

And court practice shows that in \nC6/1/99\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 100 - such a case, the element of causation can be established for all tortfeasors on a collective, \nrather than individual, basis. \n I would also note the following as regards the authorities cited by Mr Marchukov at \nMarchukov 1/15-24: \n none of the Resolutions or academic commentary quoted by Mr Marchukov (at \nMarchukov 1/18, 19 and 22-24) address, or are relevant to, the approach taken to \ncausation in a case where harm is caused by several persons acting jointly; \n in the cases referred to at Marchukov 1/22-24, the Supreme Court either found that the \ncriteria of Article 1190 were not satisfied (and, thus, joint liability was not established \nand Article 1190 was of no application), or the claimant specifically applied under Article \n1190(2) to have the liability of the persons who jointly caused harm determined on a \nnon-joint and several basis. I do not see how such cases can support Mr Marchukov’s \nview as to the purpose and effect of the joint and several liability provisions of Article \n1190(1); and \n the Traffic Accident Case  (case No. 686/10026/16-ts) described at Marchukov 1/24 is \nirrelevant for the further reason that it concerned the application of Articles 1187 and \n1188 of the Civil Code (liability for harm caused by the source of increased danger), not \nArticle 1190. \n Mr Marchukov then presents a review of court practice and academic writings at Marchukov \n1/26-37 in further support of his view that causation (along with the other elements of tort) \nmust be established against each tortfeasor individually, even in a case where Article 1190 \napplies. My comments on these are as follows: \n the academic writing quoted at Marchukov 1/26 contains only a brief reference to \ncausation, and certainly no detailed analysis, which does not appear to contradict my \nview. In any event I do not consider an academic writing to carry any weight especially \nas against the Resolutions of the Supreme Court I have relied upon in Beketov 8/192-\n193, and above, in relation to the causation of harm by several persons acting jointly; \n Marchukov 1/28 refers again to two of the cases discussed at Marchukov 1/22-24, \nwhich are irrelevant for the reasons given at paragraph 241(b) above; \nC6/1/100\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 101 -  the Olimpex Case  referred to at Marchukov 1/30 similarly is irrelevant because there a \nclaim under Articles 1166 and 1190 was brought against two defendants, but the \nSupreme Court found in relation to one of them that there was “ no unlawful conduct, \ncausation and fault ”.

In circumstances where the claimant did not establish that more \nthan one defendant had acted unlawfully, I do not consider this case to be persuasive \nas to the approach the courts will take to causation where multiple persons are found \nto have acted unlawfully and the requirements of Article 1190 are satisfied; \n the Derzhprom Case  referred to at Marchukov 1/31 is irrelevant because it concerned \na claim filed against a single individual defendant who participated in the riot. The \nSupreme Court made no attempt to establish whether the alleged harm was caused by \nmultiple persons in the riot acting jointly; \n the Ukreximbank Case  referred to at Marchukov 1/32-33 is an authority of the old \nSupreme Court of Ukraine, dating from 2014, and is also outdated (for present \npurposes) because it applied the Civil Code of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, \nwhich was in force at the time the disputed legal relations arose. For these reasons, \nthis authority is outdated and carries far less weight than the more recent Supreme \nCourt Resolutions upon which I rely; \n furthermore, in my view the Ukreximbank Case  merely illustrates a situation where the \nconduct of some but not all of the defendants is found to satisfy the criterion of jointly \ncaused harm (i.e. causing indivisible harm by actions that are (i) interrelated, (ii) \ncumulative and/or (iii) taken with unity of intent). The relevant facts of the case were as \nfollows: a bank loaned monies to Kvarta (a company) secured by a pledge given by \nAMO (a company) over sugar to be produced in future. The pledge agreement was \nconcluded by Person 5 (Kvarta’s director) and Person 6 (AMO’s director). Persons 5 \nand 6 also together presented certain documents to the bank on the basis of which the \npledge was considered to be adequate security and the loan issued. However, those \ndocuments were forged, and had been produced by AMO’s accountant, Person 7, at \nthe request of Person 6. In criminal proceedings, Persons 6 and 7 were convicted of \nforgery (and Person 6 was additionally convicted of fraud with financial resources), \nwhereas Person 5 was convicted only of official negligence in the performance of his \nduties. In subsequent tort proceedings, Persons 6 and 7 were held jointly and severally \nliable for harm caused to the bank by their actions taken together, but Person 5 was \nC6/1/101\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 102 - not. Mr Marchukov says that the Ukreximbank Case  confirms “ that the conduct of each \nco-defendant needed to be analysed separately as to whether all elements of tort under \nArticle 1166 of the [Civil Code] were made out ” (Marchukov 1/33), but I do not agree. In \nmy view, whilst it is necessary for a court, when determining a case in which a claimant \nseeks to hold multiple persons jointly and severally liable for harm caused by their joint \nactions or omissions, to consider the individual conduct of each person for the purpose \nof determining if they were a member of the group that jointly caused the harm, this \ndoes not mean that the court can or should seek to establish, for each person when \nviewed in isolation, whether they could be said to have caused the harm suffered by \nthe victim. In this particular case, the judgment contained no explanation of why the \ngroup that was found to have caused the harm did not include Person 5, but in my view \nthis outcome can readily be explained by the apparent fact that Persons 6 and 7 \nintended to defraud the bank and engaged in forgery to do so; Person 5 did not; \n the Ecoillichproduct Case referred to at Marchukov 1/34 is also an old authority of the \nnow defunct High Commercial Cour"}

Namely, the High Commercial \nCourt in its Resolution dated 27 April 2016 noted that, “ it is necessary that persons \njointly inflict damage – that is, inflict indivisible harm by interrelated collective actions or \nactions with the unity of intent ”, and pointed out that the lower courts, “ did not establish \nsuch interrelation, collectiveness of actions or the same intention of all the Defendants ”. \nThis is why the case was remanded for retrial. Upon further consideration of the case, \nit was established that, “ the defendants’ actions in this case contain no joint or common \nintent given that there is no joint and several obligation of the Customer, the General \nContractor and the Subcontractor to the Claimant ”,and accordingly it was only the \nCustomer who should be liable. This is yet another case, therefore, where the \nrequirements of Article 1190 were not met and so, in my view, it is not a good authority \nfor how the courts will approach the issue of causation where those requirements are \nmet. \nStanding approval  \n The next area of disagreement relating to Article 1190 concerns what is described in the \nBank’s pleadings as “ standing approval ”, i.e. where person A gives a form of approval to \nperson B in advance that is broad enough to encompass certain future conduct of B, even \nC6/1/102\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 103 - where such future conduct was not specifically considered and approved by A in advance \nof the relevant conduct by B (JR/61).  \n At Beketov 8/199-200, I explained why I consider that, provided that the requirements of \nArticle 1190 are met, there is no reason why A and B in this scenario could not be held jointly \nand severally liable. As I have explained above, for purposes of determining if the element \nof causation under Article 1166 is satisfied, the court will ask whether A and B’s conduct \ntaken together caused a single indivisible harm. \n The other experts disagree, stating that a person who gives their approval (whether \nstanding, express or implied) does not do anything unlawful “ as such ” (JR/61.2). I agree \nthat, in and of itself, the act of approving another person’s act is not inherently unlawful. But \nthat is not the end of the analysis; in my view, one would have to consider all the relevant \ncircumstances of the case, including (without limitation) whether person A’s act of approval \nwas intended to cause harm, or whether, by giving that approval, person A acted in breach \nof duty, in order to reach a final conclusion as to whether person A acted unlawfully. \n Mr Marchukov’s reasons for his view that person A (in the posited scenario) could not be \nheld liable under Articles 1166 and 1190, are set out at Marchukov 1/45-51. I respond to his \npoints as follows: \n at Marchukov 1/45, he states that he fails to see which rule of Ukrainian civil law could \nbe breached by a person providing a standing approval. In response, I would say that \ndepending on all the relevant facts of the case, the giving of such an approval could be \nfound, for example, to have breached that person’s fiduciary duties (as described in \nsection D of Beketov 8) or to have been intended to cause harm, contrary to Article \n3(1)(2) of the Civil Code; \n I disagree with what is said at Marchukov 1/46 (although I agree with Mr Marchukov’s \ncomment that what he says in this paragraph is “ not direc"}

In my view, ‘standing approval’ (as defined) could amount to a criminal act of \ncomplicity; depending on all the relevant facts of the case, I can see that such action \ncould make someone an accomplice under Article 27 of the Criminal Code. Nor do I \nagree with Mr Marchukov’s suggestion (for which he cites no authority) that if the \ncriminal law does not criminalise standing approval, therefore the civil law cannot deem \nstanding approval as unlawful; \nC6/1/103\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 104 -  as regards Marchukov 1/47-48, I refer to what I have said above regarding the \nestablishment of causation in a case where harm is caused by several persons acting \njointly; and \n I fail to see how the Traffic Accident Case  or Ecoillichproduct Case  referred to again at \nMarchukov 1/50 can have any relevance to this question, as neither involved a \ndefendant giving their standing approval (or anything similar) for the conduct of another \ndefendant. \nOther points \n Lastly, I would respond briefly to some of the points made in Marchukov 52-64 that I do not \nagree with but which have not already been addressed above: \n I do not agree with Mr Marchukov’s claim that there is a “ high bar ” for establishing unity \nof intent for purposes of Article 1190 (Marchukov 1/55). Mr Marchukov cites no authority \nfor this proposition. Under Ukrainian rules of civil procedure, the elements of a civil claim \nare to be proven to the standard of balance of probabilities (see paragraph 172(c) \nabove); \n each of the cases cited at Marchukov 1/56-57 involved a claim under ( inter alia ) Articles \n1166 and 1190 being brought in relation to conduct that was criminal and after the \ndefendants’ actions and intent had been established in criminal proceedings. In this \ncontext, it is not surprising that: \n the Supreme Court said in the Ukreximbank Case that in order to establish unity of \nintent for purposes of Article 1190, the defendants must have had “ the same \ncriminal intent ” (Marchukov 1/56), since it was the prior findings of criminal intent \nthat were being relied upon by the claimant as evidence of intent; and  \n in the cases cited in Marchukov 1/57, the Supreme Court did not independently \ninvestigate the joint intent of the defendants, since the claimant relied on such \nintent having been proven in the prior criminal proceedings; \n to the extent that Mr Marchukov intends to suggest that where a claim under Articles \n1166 and 1190 is brought in respect of joint action that is criminal, but in relation to \nwhich no criminal verdict exists, nevertheless the claimant must prove the tortfeasors’ \nunity of intent to the criminal standard, I disagree. The standard of proof to be met in a \nC6/1/104\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 105 - civil claim is different to that in a criminal prosecution (see paragraph 172(c) above); \nand \n the extract from the Gaz Ukrainy Case  quoted and relied upon by Mr Marchukov at \nMarchukov 1/58 supports my position that where harm is caused by several persons \nacting jointly, causation is determined by asking whether the persons’ conduct when \ntaken together caused the harm: \n“Under the legal provision, mentioned above [i.e. Article 1190], joint harm is an \nindivisible result of the actions or omissions by two or more persons.

First, it is perfectly usual for the Supreme Court \nnot to apply law to the facts but to remand a case having identified the applicable law that \nthe lower courts are to apply, which is what happened here. Secondly, there is no suggestion \nin the case rulings that the claimant’s decision, by the time of trial, to withdraw its claim \nagainst one of the two previously named defendants was due to the Supreme Court’s \nguidance on the application of Article 1190. The fact that the claim ultimately proceeded \nagainst only one of the original defendants in no way diminishes the weight of the Supreme \nCourt’s guidance as to the law that is to be applied.  \nC6/1/105\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 106 - F. LIABILITY FOR BREACH OFSPECIFIC DUTIES RELATING TOBANKS \n The experts’ points of agreement on this subject are set out at JR/62, 63, 65 and 69.  \nArticle 92(3) of the Civil Code (“Article 92(3)”) \n As recorded at JR/64, Mr Alyoshin and I disagree as to which persons within a company \nowe the so-called ‘fiduciary duties’98 set out Article 92(3), namely to act in good faith, \nreasonably, in the best interests of the company and not ultra vires. My view, set out at \nBeketov 8/205-207, is that these duties are owed by members of a company’s bodies and \nthose with authority to act in the company’s name. \n In his statement of disagreement (JR/64.2) and at Alyoshin 1/214, Mr Alyoshin appears to \nagree that these duties apply to members of a company’s bodies and those representing a \ncompany before third parties, but he asserts that they only apply at certain times and in \nrelation to certain acts, namely “ when and to the extent that [such persons] act towards third \nparties on the company’s behalf ” and/or “ when they vote on corporate decisions that are \nsubsequently put into effect by way of making transactions with third parties ”.In other words, \nMr Alyoshin appears to believe that the duties of good faith, reasonableness, acting in the \ncompany’s best interests and not ultra vires  only apply to such persons at the specific times \nwhen they are: (i) dealing with third parties in accordance with their authority, or (ii) formally \ncasting a vote on decisions that are put into effect through such third party dealings. Putting \nit more simply: Mr Alyoshin’s opinion appears to be that a company’s officers are required \nto act in the company’s best interests only some of the time, and do not have to do so the \nrest of the time.

There is no basis in the wording of Article 92 or otherwise for significantly limiting \nthe scope and application of Article 92(3) in this manner, and I note that Mr Alyoshin does \nnot refer to any court practice in support of his position. His view, if correct, would mean that \nmembers of a company’s supervisory board, management board and audit commission etc. \ncould disregard their duties under Article 92(3) when, for example, they engage in decision-\n98  As I explained at Beketov 8/203, the duties set out at Article 92 of the Civil Code, Article 63 of the JSC \nLaw and Articles 42 and 43 of the Law on Banks are often referred to in Ukrainian banking and legal \ncommunities as ‘fiduciary duties’. \nC6/1/106\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 107 - making regarding internal company matters. It would also mean that such persons would \nnot breach their duties under Article 92(3) if, for example, they actively seek to harm the \ncompany through means not involving dealings with third parties on the company’s behalf \nor the casting of formal votes.  \n At Alyoshin 1/215-218, Mr Alyoshin refers to the Supreme Court’s Resolution of 21 July 2021 \nin case No. 910/12930/18, DGF v. Person 1 et al (aka the Bank Daniel case) that I referred \nto in footnote 64 to Beketov 8/203 (albeit for the different purpose of illustrating that in that \ncase the Supreme Court confirmed that the NBU’s Recommendations on improving \ncorporate governance within banks could be used when assessing whether a bank \nexecutive’s conduct breached their statutory duties). As the extract from the Bank Daniel \ncase quoted at Alyoshin 1/216 shows, in that case the Supreme Court stated that the “ inner \nwill” of a company is formed by its bodies, and in the further passage I set out below the \nSupreme Court made clear that the fiduciary duties arising under Article 92(3) apply to all \nmembers of those bodies, not only those who represent an entity in its dealings with third \nparties: \n“154. Obligations to act on behalf of a legal entity, responsibilities for representation under \nArticle 92 of the Civil Code cover both actions on formation of internal will, and actions on \nformation of its expression of will. According to the conclusions of the Grand Chamber of \nthe Supreme Court set out in the Resolution dated 25 May 2021 in the case No. \n910/11027/18, Article 92 of the CC refers to fiduciary duties and joint and several liability of \nmembers of the management bodies of the bank as a whole, and not only those members \nof the executive body who represent the bank in relations with third parties. ” \n This supports my position insofar as it confirms that fiduciary duties are not owed only by \nthose individuals who actually represent a company in its dealings with third parties. Mr \nAlyoshin appears to accept that the Bank Daniel  case correctly represents Ukrainian law \n(Alyoshin 1/218) even though he says that he does not personally agree with it (Alyoshin \n1/215).  \n Another recent authority supporting my view is the Trust Bank case, discussed at paragraph \n235 above.

In its Resolution dated 28 October 2021 in case No. 910/9851/20, the Supreme \nCourt expressly rejected an approach to assessing breach of fiduciary duty that focuses \nsolely on “ the formal side of the issue ”, i.e. compliance with formalities. Instead, the Supreme \nCourt favoured a broader approach of enquiring whether a fiduciary’s actions or omissions \n(of any type) are consistent with the duties at Article 92(3): \nC6/1/107\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 108 - “The main purpose of fiduciary duties is the need to ensure the economic development of \nthe enterprise, and accordingly failure to comply with such basic responsibilities may lead \nto causing harm to the enterprise and the obligation to reimburse it. \nTherefore, when applying Article 92 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, it is necessary to assess \nnot only the formal side of the issue - the official’s compliance with all legal provisions, \nstatutes, decisions of the general meeting of participants/shareholders, etc. Since even \nwhen an official formally complies with all the requirements of the law and the constituent \ndocuments of the company, his actions (inaction) may not be bona fide, reasonable and \ncommitted in the interests of the company ”99. \n I would also refer to the “Principles of Corporate Governance”, approved by Decision No. \n955, dated 22 July 2014, of the National Securities and Stock Market Commission of \nUkraine. Although this statement of principles does not have binding force for companies, \nincluding banks, it sets out the standards of corporate behaviour expected by the regulator, \nand the language of section III, paragraphs 3.3.1(3) and (4) makes clear that fiduciary duties \ndo not apply merely when the fiduciary is representing a company before third parties or \nformally making decisions:\n“Actions in the best interests of the company presuppose that the officials of the company’s \nbodies use their powers and opportunities related to the positions they hold, exclusively in \nthe interests of the company. \nOfficials of the company’s bodies do not carry out actions that contradict or do not \ncorrespond to the company’s interests. \nIn particular, officials do not receive any remuneration (directly or indirectly) for exerting \ninfluence on decision-making by the company’s bodies, using the company’s property in \ntheir own interests or in the interests of third parties, disclosing information with limited \naccess, etc ”.\n Although published a number of years ago, in 2014, these “Principles of Corporate \nGovernance” have been referred to with approval by the Supreme Court on a number of \noccasions, including recently. For example, in its Resolution dated 15 June 2022, in case \nNo. 905/671/19, the Supreme Court noted that: “ The Principles of Corporate Governance, \napproved by the decision of the NCCPFR dated 22.07.2014 N 955, recommended for use \nin joint-stock companies, contain the following recommendations that reflect the best \npractices of corporate governance … ”. \n99  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 28 October 2021, case No. 910/9851/20, DGF v.

{"start": 290500, "text": " of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 109 - Article 63 of the JSC Law (“Article 63”) \n The experts’ points of agreement regarding Article 63 are set out at JR/65. There are three \npoints of disagreement, addressed below. \nCompliance with the Bank’s ‘other documents’ \n The experts agree that the duties imposed by Article 63 include a duty to follow the \ncompany’s charter and other documents, and that within the Bank, such ‘other documents’ \ninclude the Bank’s supervisory board regulations, management board regulations, \nregulations of the general meeting of shareholders, credit committee regulations and \nLending Procedures Manual in force from time to time (JR/65.2-3).  \n At JR/66, however, Mr Alyoshin and I disagree as to whether the duty to comply with all such \n‘other documents’ was owed (at the material times) by all the Bank’s officers (my view) or \nwhether a particular officer’s duty to comply with such documents “ would be determined by \nthe Bank’s charter, the officer’s role within the Bank and the terms of their contract ” (Mr \nAlyoshin’s view; JR/66.2). \n I believe the basis for Mr Alyoshin’s disagreement with me is that he does not see why, for \nexample, a member of the Bank’s supervisory board should owe a duty to comply with the \nBank’s credit committee regulations (or vice versa). His view appears to be that each Bank \nofficer owes a duty to comply only with those particular provisions of particular internal \ndocuments that directly relate to that officer’s role and responsibilities. Whilst I agree that \nthe scope of a particular officer’s role and responsibilities will usually be defined by the \ndocuments that directly regulate their activities and/or the activities of the body(ies) of which \nthey are a member, and on a practical level an officer might not need to refer regularly to \ninternal documents (or parts of documents) that do not relate to their role or responsibilities, \nI do not see any principled basis for concluding that officers do not still owe (at all times) a \nduty to comply with all of a company’s ‘other documents’.  \n If Mr Alyoshin’s view were to be correct, significant uncertainty would arise in any situation \nwhere a company officer acts outside the scope of their formal authority. If such conduct \nwas contrary to one of that company’s ‘other documents’, it appears that Mr Alyoshin’s view \nwould be that this would not amount to a breach of Article 63. In my view that cannot be \nright.  \nC6/1/109\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 110 -  By way of analogy, in relation to any particular company officer, the company’s Charter will \ncontain many provisions that relate to that officer’s authorised sphere of activity, and many \nthat will not.

Budkin, \nMayeryan, Avramenko and others . \nC6/1/111\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 112 - Failure of a bank’s supervisory board to consider loans falling within its authority \n JR/68 records our disagreement as to whether the members of a bank’s supervisory board \nbreach Article 63 if a loan agreement does not undergo the supervisory board’s examination \nand is not subjected to the voting (approval) procedure as required by the bank’s charter or \ninternal documents:  \n My view is that where applicable law, a bank’s Charter or other internal documents require \na particular loan to be approved by a bank’s supervisory board, the supervisory board’s \nmembers will breach Article 63 if the loan is instead approved by another body of the bank \n(such as a credit committee) other than its general meeting of shareholders. I refer in this \nregard to all the reasons set out at Beketov 8/211-214. \n I would also refer to paragraph 2.4 of the “Methodological Recommendations on \nImprovement of Corporate Governance in Banks of Ukraine”, approved by NBU Resolution \nNo. 98 dated 28 March 2007, cited in footnote 64 of Beketov 8, which state that a bank’s \nsupervisory board members have a duty to monitor the activities of their bank: “ The duty of \ngood faith also imposes on the members of the supervisory boards permanent responsibility \nfor monitoring the bank’s compliance with the legislation of Ukraine, as well as for the bank’s \nactivities as such ”104. In July 2022, the Supreme Court referred to and described this duty \nas follows: “ 110. Methodological recommendations for improving corporate governance in \nUkrainian banks prescribes that the duty of good faith requires managers to make decisions \nbased on all necessary information, responsibility for monitoring the bank’s compliance with \nUkrainian law, as well as the bank’s activities as such. When making decisions, managers \ncan rely on information provided by bank employees, but this possibility does not release \nthem from personal responsibility for making independent decisions (clause 2.4) ” 105. \n Mr Alyoshin’s contrary view is that the mere fact that the execution of a loan is not approved \n(examined) by the supervisory board does not, without more, amount to a breach of Article \n63 by the supervisory board’s members, nor does it follow that there was an unlawful \n104  For completeness I note that, by Resolution dated 3 December 2018, the NBU replaced its 2007 \nRecommendations with a new set of Recommendations. Paragraphs 24, 38 and 72 of these new \nRecommendations together provide that a bank’s supervisory board is responsible for ensuring that the \nbank’s activities, the activities of its department heads, and the supervisory board’s own regulations, all \ncomply with Ukrainian legislation. The new Recommendations use the term ‘bank council’ instead of \n‘supervisory board’, but the two terms are synonymous: paragraph 28 of the new Recommendations \ndefines the functions of a bank council with reference to Article 52 of the JSC and Article 39 of the Law on \nBanks, which define the functions of a supervisory board.  \n105  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 25 July 2022, case No. 922/2860/18.  \nC6/1/112\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 113 - delegation of the supervisory board’s powers to another bod"}

Mr \nAlyoshin elaborates upon this position at Alyoshin 1/225-230, where he opines (with \nreference to the particular facts of this case) that because the Relevant Loans were in fact \napproved by the Bank’s credit committee, not by its supervisory board, therefore the \napproval of the Relevant Loans cannot have involved the members of the Bank’s supervisory \nboard in any breach of their fiduciary duties. \n But Mr Alyoshin’s position fails to account for a key assumption in the posited scenario, \nnamely that the particular loan was required to be approved by the supervisory board. It also \nfails to take into account (i) the provisions of Articles 51(1), 51(4) and 52(3) of the JSC Law, \nwhich impose duties on a company’s supervisory board members not to delegate their duties \nor to allow other bodies to exercise authority that is within the exclusive competence of the \nsupervisory board (see further Beketov 8/211-212), and (ii) the duty of a bank’s supervisory \nboard members to monitor their bank’s activities and compliance with law. In my view, when \ncompany officers breach duties owed to the company (including by way of omission) they \ncannot be said to be acting in the company’s best interests, hence a breach of Article 63 \n(and Article 92(3) of the Civil Code) occurs as well. \n Mr Alyoshin’s position is also based upon his compartmentalised view (as I have discussed \nabove) that fiduciary duties are engaged only at specific times in relation to specific activities \nand, in particular, that members of a bank’s supervisory board owe fiduciary duties only \nwhen they deal with third parties on the company’s behalf or formally vote on a decision. In \nmy view, members of a bank’s supervisory board must observe and be guided by their \nfiduciary duties at all times, which is a point I shall return to below as Mr Alyoshin’s contrary \nview informs a number of the areas of disagreement between us. It suffices to say for \npurposes of rebutting Mr Alyoshin’s position in relation to our disagreement at JR/68 that \nfiduciary duties may be breached by omission as well as action (as Mr Alyoshin agrees; \nJR/62.2), and I consider that a supervisory board member’s failure to discharge their \nobligations, including where another body within the bank (other than the general meeting \nof shareholders) authorises loans that are within the supervisory board’s exclusive \ncompetence, would constitute a breach of Article 63.  \nC6/1/113\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 114 - Articles 42 and 43 of the Law on Banks \n The experts’ points of agreement under this sub-heading are at JR/69. There are five areas \nof disagreement, some of which are repetitive of those discussed above. \nOverlap between Articles 42 and 43 of the Law on Banks and Article 63 of the JSC Law  \n Although identified as an area of disagreement at JR/70, in fact I do not believe there is any \nmaterial difference between us on this issue because Mr Alyoshin agrees with my evidence \nat Beketov 8/223, 232-233 that Articles 42 and 43 of the Law on Banks and Article 63 of the \nJSC Law impose duties that overlap but are not contradictory. Accordingly, a person who \nqualifies as both a bank executive (for purpose of the Law on Banks) and a company officer \n(for purpose of the JSC Law) owes both sets of duties set out in these Articles \nsimultaneously. \n Whist I do not agree with Mr Alyoshin’s view that, were any conflict to exist between these \nArticles, the L"}

Duty to protect the bank’s interests \nThe executives of a bank are obligated to act for the benefit of the bank and its clients and \nare obligated to place the interests of the bank above their own when performing their \nobligations in accordance with the requirements of this Law. \nIn particular, the bank’s executives are required: \n1. to behave responsibly when performing the duties of their office; \n2. to take decisions within the bounds of the powers given to them; \n3. to refrain from using their office in their personal interests; \nC6/1/114\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 115 - 4. to secure the integrity and transfer of the bank’s property and documents when \nexecutives are dismissed from their office ”. \n At JR/71, Mr Alyoshin disagrees with my opinion that members of a bank’s supervisory board \nmust comply with the above duties at all times. Instead, Mr Alyoshin considers that these \nduties are engaged only at those times when the members of a bank’s supervisory board \nare discharging their duties as supervisory board members (JR/71.2).  \n Mr Alyoshin relies on the words “ when performing their obligations in accordance with the \nrequirements of this Law ” that appear in Article 43 (Alyoshin 1/224). This leads him to \nconclude at Alyoshin 1/225-230 (as I have noted above) that if the Relevant Loans were \napproved by the Bank’s credit committee, not by its supervisory board, then the approval of \nthe Relevant Loans cannot have involved the members of the supervisory board in any \nbreach of their fiduciary duties. \n I disagree. In my view the obligation of the members of a bank’s supervisory board to comply \nwith their fiduciary duties set out in Article 43 (as well as those set out in Article 42 of the \nLaw on Banks, Article 63 of the JSC Law and Article 92(3) of the Civil Code) is engaged at \nall times. I have already made several points against Mr Alyoshin’s contrary view at \nparagraphs 252 to 258 and 261 to 265 above, and I would additionally note that: \n I am not aware of any court practice, and Mr Alyoshin refers to none, that supports his \ninterpretation that the fiduciary duties arising under Article 43 are owed only when a \nmember of a supervisory board is performing an obligation in accordance with the law; \n Mr Alyoshin agrees that fiduciary duties can be breached by omission as well as positive \naction (see JR/62.2 and Beketov 8/227-230), which in my view undermines his position \nthat such duties are owed only when fiduciaries are taking certain actions in discharge \nof their obligations;  \n paragraph 1.12 of the NBU’s 2007 Recommendations on Corporate Governance (see \nparagraph 271 above) expressly states that “ [a] fiduciary is always required to act in \ngood faith and impartially ”; and \n Article 43 "}

In my view, the types of conduct sought to be prevented by \nthis provision would include (for example) a bank executive using their position to \nC6/1/115\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 116 - extract favourable treatment from third parties in matters relating to their personal lives \nor other business ventures, or using knowledge acquired through their position at the \nbank for their own personal financial advantage. Yet on Mr Alyoshin’s approach, such \nconduct, which would not involve the supervisory board member carrying out any formal \nresponsibilities, would not amount to a breach of Article 43. This cannot be right. It is \nfundamentally contrary to the purpose of imposing these high standards of behaviour \nupon bank executives to suggest that they must comply with such obligations only when \nacting as a supervisory board member and are free to put their personal interests above \nthose of the bank at all other times, including when they fail to perform their duties. \nSupervisory board’s failure to consider related party loans over USD 500,000 \n The area of disagreement recorded at JR/72 treads the same ground as those at JR/68 and \nJR/71, addressed above. \n Here, Mr Alyoshin and I disagree as to whether the members of the Bank’s supervisory \nboard would breach Article 43 if loans over USD 500,000 made to the Bank’s related parties \nwere not subjected to voting (approval) by the supervisory board.  \n As I explained at Beketov 8/213, 223(a), under the Bank’s Charter and supervisory board \nregulations, the Bank’s supervisory board had the “ exclusive ” competence to approve \nrelated party loans over USD 500,000. In my view, the members of the Bank’s supervisory \nboard would breach the Bank’s Charter and supervisory board regulations, and their duties \nunder Articles 51(1), 51(4) and 52(3) of the JSC Law, if such related party loans were instead \napproved only by the Bank’s credit committee. In my further view, it follows that they would \nalso be in breach of their fiduciary duties under Article 43 (as well as those at Article 42 of \nthe Law on Banks, Article 63 of the JSC Law and Article 92(3) of the Civil Code). \n Mr Alyoshin’s contrary view again promotes a very compartmentalised approach to the \nfulfilment of fiduciary duties by bank executives, suggesting that if the members of the Bank’s \nsupervisory board do not vote on a particular loan, then they do not owe the bank any \nfiduciary duties in respect of that loan and so cannot be found to have breached any such \nduties. As I have stated above, this position is not supported by the wording of the relevant \nArticles nor by court practice, and is fundamentally contrary to the high standards of \nbehaviour expected of bank executives.  \nC6/1/116\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 117 -  As explained at Beketov 8/214 (subject to the correction I have made at paragraph 6(a) \nabove, to the extent that the bank executives can establish that they were not at fault (i.e. \nthat they did not breach their duties intentionally or negligently), then they might be able to \navoid tortious liability in respect of any harm caused by their unlawful conduct (as the \nelement of fault under Article 1166 would not be satisfied), but this would not change my \nview that a breach of their duties had occurred.  \n Further in relation to the issue of faul"}

It is not clear to me what Mr Alyoshin means by this proviso, but to the \nextent he is repeating his view that a supervisory board member only owes (and so can only \nbreach) fiduciary duties when exercising their rights and powers as a supervisory board \nmember, such as when formally voting upon a proposed loan, then I would repeat my \ndisagreement with this compartmentalised approach, for all the reasons I have set out \nabove. \nCan a bank executive embezzle funds from a bank without breaching their fiduciary duties? \n JR/74 records Mr Alyoshin’s disagreement with what I would have expected to be an \nuncontroversial proposition, namely that where a bank executive “ orchestrates or otherwise \nparticipates in a scheme to embezzle funds from their bank ”, they will necessarily have \nbreached their fiduciary duties to the bank (including those owed under Article 43). I have \ndescribed this as “self-evident”. \n Mr Alyoshin says this is not self-evident. He says that whether or not a bank executive who \norchestrates or otherwise participates in a scheme to embezzle funds from their bank will \nbreach their fiduciary duties will “ depend both on the role of the executive and the actual \nacts committed as part of the scheme ” (JR/74.2 and Alyoshin 1/footnote 166).

I agree that this \nSoviet-era law recognised an analogous cause of action in unjust enrichment (also referred \nto as a ‘condictio’ claim from the Roman law), but that cause of action was enacted in the \n1960s when Ukraine was governed by a communist ideology with only limited recognition of \nprivate property rights. The modern cause of action at Article 1212, on the other hand, was \nmodelled on the Commonwealth of Independent States (“ CIS”)’ Model Civil Code of 1995, \nwhich was developed by the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly for use in the post-Soviet \nmarket economy. Ukraine was one of the states that founded the CIS in 1991, and although \nit never became a full member (as it chose not to ratify the CIS Charter), Ukraine participated \nin its activities to varying degrees until 2018, including the harmonisation of civil legislation. \n The rules governing the modern cause of action contain a number of material differences \nfrom the rules governing the Soviet cause of action. Some of the key (non-exhaustive) \ndifferences include the following:  \n under the Soviet cause of action, property acquired “ as a result of … actions committed \nwith a purpose that is obviously contrary to the interests of the socialist state and \nsociety ” was forfeit to the State (Article 470 of the Soviet Civil Code). Under the modern \ncause of action, the purpose/intent of the acquirer is irrelevant to the question of \n109  My statement of disagreement at JR/76.1 could have been more accurately worded, as it says that “ a \ncause of action for unjust enrichment was introduced into Ukrainian law relatively recently ”. Consistent \nwith my evidence at Beketov 8/242, I should have instead said “ the cause of action for unjust enrichment \nunder Article 1212 was introduced into Ukrainian law relatively recently ”. \n110  The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. \nC6/1/121\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 122 - whether the claimant is entitled to a remedy (Article 1212(2) of the Civil Code); the \nliability is a no-fault liability and the remedy is restitutionary in nature; \n under the modern cause of action, the claimant is entitled to a remedy even if the \nacquirer did nothing to facilitate its acquisition of the property and only received it as \nthe result of the acts of a third party or an external event (Article 1212(2) of the Civil \nCode); no such provision was made in the Soviet cause of action; and \n under the modern cause of action, compensatory interest accrues on amounts of unjust \nenrichment (Article 1214(2) of the Civil Code); no such remedy was prescribed"}

As set out below, our respective positions are informed by our views as \nto how the requirement of Article 1212 that a defendant’s enrichment be ‘at the claimant’s \nexpense’ applies in such a situation. \n As stated at Beketov 8/270, the proper defendant(s) to an unjust enrichment claim are those \nwho acquired property without sufficient legal grounds and at the Bank’s expense. \nConsistent with this, at Beketov 8/248, 250, I explained that, in my view, where person A \nhas acquired property without sufficient legal grounds at the expense of person B, and A \nhas subsequently dissipated its unjust enrichment to person C, B may pursue an unjust \nenrichment claim against A or C, or indeed could pursue separate unjust enrichment claims \nagainst each of them (although B would not be permitted to double recover). This assumes \nthat the elements of Article 1212 are satisfied in respect of C’s acquisition, and in my view \nthis should be the case where there is a causative link between the first and second \ntransfers, because in that case C’s enrichment can be said to have been at B’s expense. \nSee further the authorities I relied upon at Beketov 8/255 and 258.  \nC6/1/122\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 123 -  Mr Nahnybida’s contrary view is that, in the posited scenario, B would only have an unjust \nenrichment claim against A (see Nahnybida 3/144). The existence of a causative link \nbetween the first and second transfers would be irrelevant, because in his view the concept \nof causation should not be ‘introduced’ into Article 1212 and “ chains of events causally linked \ntogether have no role to play in the Article 1212 analysis ” (Nahnybida 3/142).  \n I do not agree. I consider that a causative element to a claim in unjust enrichment is inherent \nto the requirement of Article 1212 that the defendant’s enrichment be ‘at the claimant’s \nexpense’, and Mr Nahnybida has not identified any good reason why this requirement cannot \nbe satisfied where an enrichment has passed from claimant to defendant via two separate \nbut causally connected transactions or events. \n I do not find either of the policy arguments made at Nahnybida 3/143 convincing: \n Mr Nahnybida first suggests that my approach would allow a claimant to enforce \nmultiple restitutionary obligations against different persons (i.e. in the posited scenario, \nB could bring separate unjust enrichment claims against each of A and C), but there is \nnothing inherently objectionable about this provided that the claimant does not double \nrecover (and as explained at paragraph 200(f) above, in my experience courts are able \nto ensure that double recovery does not occur); and  \n he then suggests that my approach “ would place an excessive burden ” on the claimant \n“to search for his own property ” by identif"}

This argument does not make sense to me, including because \n(i) the claimant would not be obliged to search for any acquirer beyond the first; he could \nalways sue the first acquirer; and (ii) if the claimant prefers to try and identify the ultimate \nacquirer, I see no reason to describe this as an “ excessive burden ” (if anything, having \na choice of defendants would tend to reduce the claimant’s burden). I would say it is \ncommensurate with the task facing any victim who seeks to identify the proper \ndefendant(s) against whom a claim can be brought. Indeed, it may be in the claimant’s \ninterest to identify and pursue a second (or further) acquirer if the immediate acquirer \nlacks sufficient assets to satisfy a claim. \n I would also note that if Mr Nahnybida were correct, it would mean that a person setting out \nto unjustly enrich himself at another’s expense could avoid liability under Article 1212 by \nC6/1/123\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 124 - imposing a straw man in a chain of transactions between himself and the victim. I consider \nthat, for reasons of policy, the Ukrainian courts would reject such an outcome. \n The authorities relied upon at Nahnybida 3/145-150 do not support his view: \n the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 12 November 2018 in case \nNo. 529/1060/16-ts (quoted at Nahnybida 3/145) and the Resolution of the Supreme \nCourt dated 26 November 2019 in case No. 902/201/19 (quoted at Nahnybida 3/146) \ncontain only general descriptions of Article 1212 and say no more than that the \nenrichment in the defendant’s hands must correspond to a decrease in the claimant’s \nhands. But there is nothing in the quoted passages to suggest that this cannot be the \ncase where an enrichment has passed from defendant to claimant via two separate but \ncausally connected events; \n the article relied upon at Nahnybida 3/148 indeed describes the increase to the \nacquirer’s property as being the “ direct consequence of the simultaneous ” decrease to \nthe victim’s property, but I would not put any weight on what is, read in context, a generic \ndescription of a typical unjust enrichment situation, rather than a prescriptive statement \nof the only conditions in which a defendant’s enrichment will be found to be ‘at the \nexpense of’ a claimant111. Furthermore, this statement appears to have been an attempt \nto summarise the position of the Supreme Court of Ukraine in its Resolution dated 2 \nOctober 2013 in case No. 6-88цс13, but that Resolution does not use either the word \n‘direct’ or ‘simultaneous’. Instead, it reads in relevant part: \n“Objective conditions for establishment of obligations related to acquisition or \npreservation of property without sufficient legal ground shall be the following: \n1) acquisition or preservation of property by a person (a person who acquired property) \nat the expense of another person (a victim); 2) loss in the form of reduction or non-\nincrease in property on the part of another person (a victim); 3) corresponding increase \nor preservation of property on the part of a person who acquired property by virtue of \nreduction or non-increase in property on the part of victim; 4) lack of legal ground for \nsaid change in property condition of these persons ”; \n I also note that even in circumstances of unjust enrichment that do not involve a chain \nof transactions, there is no requirement of “ simultaneous ” increase/decr"}

Extending this analogy to a situation involving a chain of \ntransactions, hypothetically if that same passer-by were to give the banknotes to their \nspouse, I consider that the bank could maintain an unjust enrichment claim against \neither individual (provided it does not double recover); and\n the Resolution of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court dated 22 September 2020 \nin case No. 910/3009/18, referred to at Nahnybida 3/150, concerned the claim of a bank \n(represented by the Authorised Officer of the DGF) to have the NBU return certain \nsecurities to it. I do not consider this case to be relevant because: \n the Resolution did not deal directly with the application of Article 1212, but the \napplication of Article 73 of the NBU Law and Articles 51-52 of the DGF Law; and \n although the Supreme Court commented that if the NBU no longer had the \nsecurities but had alienated them to a third person, then the bank’s claim against \nthe NBU would not be a claim to recover the securities themselves but to recover \ntheir value, this cannot in my view be read as precluding the possibility of the bank \nbringing an unjust enrichment claim against such third person (a scenario which \nthe Supreme Court did not consider in its Resolution) if, on all the relevant facts of \nthe case, that third person’s enrichment also was at the bank’s expense. \nChange of position \n JR/80 records the experts’ point of disagreement as to whether a defence of change of \nposition exists under Ukrainian unjust enrichment law.  \n As stated at Beketov 8/249, there is no defence of change of position provided for in the \nCivil Code nor am I aware of any Ukrainian court practice introducing such a defence into \nUkrainian law. I would supplement my previous evidence by noting that: \n under Article 1213 of the Civil Code, an acquirer is expressly required to pay \ncompensation to the victim even when it is no longer possible for the acquirer to return \nthe property in kind; and \n more generally, my understanding of the defence of change of position under English \nlaw is that it gives effect to policy considerations as to what is a fair allocation of loss in \nC6/1/125\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 126 - circumstances where the acquirer, acting bona fide , no longer has the property by which \nit was unjustly enriched. The policy underlying the absence of any such defence in \nUkrainian law is that the whole of the loss should rest with the person(s) who acquired \nthe property without legal grounds (Article 1212(1),(2) of the Civil Code). \n The stated basis for Mr Nahnybida’s disagreement with me on this issue is that he had no \ninstructions to address this subject in the joint report (JR/80.2). As such, I will not be in a \nposition to know or comment upon the reasons for his disagreement until I receive his \nsupplemental report. \nHolding monies received to the account of a third party and/or in which that third party \nholds the beneficial interest \n The area of disagreement at JR/81 arises because Mr "}

All these points support \nmy conclusion that in the posited scenario, A cannot escape liability under Article 1212 by \narguing that he holds the unjust enrichment for C or that C is the beneficial owner. \n In support of his contrary view, Mr Nahnybida states that if money was received into A’s \nbank account but, at that time it was received, the relationship between A and C means that \nC “became owner of this property ”, then B has no claim under Article 1212 against A \n(JR/81.2). He further states that this will be the case if the relationship between A and C is \nC6/1/126\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 127 - one where A is a “ commission agent ” for the purposes of Article 1018 of Civil Code (“ Article \n1018 ”) (Nahnybida 3/176-177)112. \n Article 1018 provides that “ the property acquired by the commission agent at the expense \nof the commission principal is the property of the commission principal ”. I agree that under \nthis provision where a commission agent receives funds pursuant to his agency agreement, \nthe effect of that provision is that those funds are treated under Ukrainian law as being \nowned by the commission agent’s principal, and the commission agent has no rights of \nownership to the funds. I do not, however, see how this rule of Ukrainian law can have any \napplication in the present case, where the Agency Agreements in question between the \nEnglish Suppliers and their Principals are alleged by the Bank to be void, which if correct \nwould in my view eliminate any basis for saying that the English Suppliers held the funds \nthey received to the account of their Principals, or that the Principals held the beneficial \ninterest in those funds. \n Furthermore, even if the Agency Agreements are valid, the Bank would have good grounds \nfor asserting that Article 1018 is irrelevant in the present case: \n because the Agency Agreements are governed by English law, a provision of Ukrainian \nlaw such as Article 1018, which governs the rights of principals and agents under their \nagency agreements, would be of no application; and \n in any event, if the Bank is correct that the Defendant Suppliers had no sufficient legal \nbasis for receiving the Unreturned Prepayments, then I do not consider that Article 1018 \ncould apply so as to have the effect of conferring ownership of the funds acquired on \nthe agent’s principal.

I am instructed that as a matter \n112  The meaning of “ commission agent ” can be taken from Article 1011 of the Civil Code, which states: “ Under \na commission agreement, one party (commission agent) undertakes, on behalf of the other party \n(commission principal), to perform one or more transactions for a fee on its own behalf, but at the expense \nof the principal ”. \n113  I note that clause 3(v) of the Agency Agreements entered into by each of the Third and Fifth Defendants \nstates that “ All money held by the Agent at any time in respect of the Business Activities shall save for the \nC6/1/127\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 128 - of English law, and assuming that the funds were lawfully acquired by the English Suppliers, \nthe Principals in such circumstances would have held the beneficial title to any funds lawfully \nacquired by the English Suppliers whilst the English Suppliers held the legal title. The \nposition of the English Suppliers under English law seems to me to be materially different \nfrom the position of a commission agent under Ukrainian law (pursuant to which there is no \ndivision of ownership of property into legal and beneficial titles), and so in my view, if the \nposition of the English Suppliers under English law were to be explained to a Ukrainian court, \nit is likely that the court would conclude that the English Suppliers, as holders of the legal \ntitle to the funds, had acquired property for purposes of Article 1212.  \nThe meaning of ‘at the expense of’ \n Under this sub-heading, Mr Nahnybida and I have two points of disagreement. \n First, we disagree at JR/82 as to the meaning of the ‘at the expense of’ requirement of Article \n1212. I have already addressed our respective views on this issue at paragraphs 298 to 303 \nabove, in the context of explaining why C’s enrichment can be at the expense of B in \ncircumstances where A is unjustly enriched at B’s expense and then transfers the \nenrichment to C, provided there is a sufficient causal link (which is a question of fact). \n Secondly, we disagree at JR/83 as to whether there must be a reduction in the claimant’s \nproperty in order for an unjust enrichment claim to be brought. In my view, although an unjust \nenrichment case typically will involve a reduction in the claimant’s property, this is not a \nrequirement of Article 1212. I explained this at Beketov 8/256 with reference to hypothetical \nscenarios of a person taking water from a stream passing through another person’s property, \nor tapping into that other person’s wireless internet connection, without permission, and then \nusing or selling those resources for their own benefit. In neither case have the resources of \nthe claimant been reduced. \n Mr Nahnybida’s contrary view appears to be based on his position regarding the ‘at the \nexpense of’ requirement of Article 1212, to which I have already responded above. \nconsideration and reimbursement of expenses referred to in Article 6 be held by Agent as trustee for the \nPrincipal ”.

This effectively duplicates the area of disagreement discussed at \nparagraphs 298 to 303 above, my view being that this does not matter provided that a causal \nlink exists between the Defendant Suppliers’ enrichment and the Bank’s loss such that the \nenrichment was at the Bank’s expense (see Beketov 8/257-259).\n Secondly, we disagree at JR/85 as to whether it matters for the purposes of the Bank’s \nunjust enrichment claim that the monies received by the Defendant Suppliers were not the \nsame monies (in the proprietary sense) that were transferred by the Bank to the Borrowers. \n In my view, this does not matter; the Bank’s unjust enrichment claim is not a proprietary \nclaim, and if (i) the Bank’s payments to the Borrowers under the Relevant Loans, and (ii) the \nBorrowers’ payments of the Unreturned Prepayments to the Defendant Suppliers, are found \nto be causally linked, then the Defendant Suppliers’ enrichment in my view would be \nregarded as having been at the Bank’s expense (see Beketov 8/260-262). \n Mr Nahnybida’s contrary view arises from his position that “ Article 1212 is not causation \nbased ” (JR/85.2), but I have responded to his position in this regard, and the authorities he \nrelies upon, at paragraphs 300 to 303 above.\n Thirdly, we disagree at JR/86 as to whether the Bank’s unjust enrichment claim would be \naffected if the monies received by the Defendant Suppliers were used purportedly to repay \nearlier loans advanced by the Bank. In my view, the Bank’s claim would not be affected, for \nthe reasons set out at Beketov 8/263-265.  \n Mr Nahnybida’s contrary view is that the reduction in the Bank’s property (by the Relevant \nLoans) will have been “ decreased ” (i.e. made whole) by the amount returned to the Bank (in \nrepayment of earlier loans), and therefore any obligation on the Borrowers to give restitution \nunder Article 1213 of the Civil Code would be terminated (JR/86.2). Mr Nahnybida thus \nappears to suggest that the payment to the Bank would terminate both the earlier loan debt \nandthe Relevant Borrowers’ restitutionary obligation, which I cannot agree with. It would \nmean, for example, that if person A borrows €100 from person B, and a week later B \nC6/1/129\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 130 - mistakenly drops a €100 banknote on the ground which A picks up and keeps, A could return \nthat €100 banknote to B in purported repayment of the loan and by doing so discharge both \nhis indebtedness on the loan and his obligation to return the unjustly acquired banknote. \nThis would clearly be an unjust outcome.  \n Fourthly, at JR/87 we disagree as to whether the Bank’s claim would be affected if a number \nof purported repayments of the capital advanced under the Relevant Loans and/or interest \nwere made from funds advanced by the Bank under other Relevant Loans, Intermediary \nLoans or New Loans, all of which are alleged by the Bank to be void.  \n According to my view, at Beketov 8/265, such purported repayments would not alter the \nBank’s unjust enrichment claim agai"}

Although \nthe Borrowers would have returned funds to the Bank equal in amount to the Defendants’ \nunjust enrichment, because those funds effectively were stolen from the Bank through \nseparate loans which were (on the Bank’s case) void or otherwise unlawful (in particular, \nthey were the product of the Defendants’ tortious conduct causing harm to the Bank), \ntherefore by analogy with what I said at Beketov 8/137-141, I consider that the Bank would \nhave the option of pursuing (i) the Defendant Suppliers in unjust enrichment, and/or (ii) the \ntortfeasors involved in the separate unlawful loans in tort, provided it does not double \nrecover. \n Mr Nahnybida’s contrary view is that even assuming the funds returned to the Bank in \npurported repayment of the Relevant Loans are referable to separate, unlawful loans, this \nwould “ not impact on the legality of the subsequent transfers of those funds to third parties \nand what use is made of those funds by those third parties ” (JR/87.2). I take from this that \nMr Nahnybida considers that where funds are stolen from a bank (or any other person or \nentity), the legal effect and consequences of any transactions or payments then entered into \nusing those stolen funds will not be affected by their ill-gotten nature. I do not agree, and \nrefer again to what I said at Beketov 8/137-141.  \n Furthermore, to hold otherwise would in my view effectively validate the type of fraudulent \nloan recycling scheme at issue in these proceedings, as those involved in such a fraud could \nrepeatedly steal money through successive rounds of fraudulent lending, which they could \nthen use to eliminate any accrued tortious or restitutionary liabilities arising from the earlier \nrounds of fraudulent lending, forcing the victim repeatedly to have to uncover, investigate \nC6/1/130\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 131 - and bring claims in respect of the latest round of lending. I consider that a Ukrainian court \nwould resolve the various legal issues that arise in connection with such a scheme in a way \nthat would best ensure that the victim’s property rights are protected and that it is fully \ncompensated for its loss. \n Mr Nahnybida refers to Nahnybida 3/163-175 in support of his position (JR/87.2). However, \nNahnybida 3/163-172 are all premised on either the Relevant Loans or the Relevant Supply \nAgreements being valid. Mr Nahnybida assumes the voidness of these agreements for the \npurposes of Nahnybida 3/173-175, but the only point he makes in these paragraphs is that \nthe Bank would in that case be able to bring an unjust enrichment claim against the \nBorrowers but not the Defendant Suppliers. This is based on his view regarding the \napplication of Article 1212 to chains of transactions, which I disagree with as explained at \nparagraphs 298 to 303 above.  \nThe meaning of ‘without sufficient legal grounds’ \n At JR/89, we disagree as to the potential applicability of the abuse of rights rule to the Bank’s \nunjust enrichment claim. \n According to my view, set out at Beketov 8/81-88, 268, if an acquirer relies upon a legal right \nas a defence to a claim in unjust enrichment, the court may refuse to protect that right if it is \nbeing exercised abusively. Therefore, even if the Relevant Supply Agreements were found \nto be valid, if they were entered into with the intention of "}

Therefore, even if the Relevant Supply Agreements were found \nto be valid, if they were entered into with the intention of harming the Bank’s rights, and were \ntherefore abusive, in my view those agreements could not be relied upon as providing the \nDefendant Suppliers with a lawful basis for receiving their enrichment (the Unreturned \nPrepayments).  \n Mr Nahnybida disagrees with me on the basis of his statement that “ [a]buse of rights should \nnot be considered as the kind of lack of sufficient grounds under Article 1212 ” (JR/89.2). I \nrefer in this regard to what I have said at paragraphs 155 to 156 above regarding the wide \nscope and flexible application of the abuse of rights rule. \n Further in this regard, I note that the Supreme Court’s Resolution dated 11 November 2021 \nin case No. 910/8482/18 (910/4866/21)114, which I discuss in more detail at paragraph 385 \nbelow, makes clear that the abuse of rights rule may be invoked not only to defeat a \n114  The case has two case numbers because the claimant’s claim (represented by the second number) was \nmade within bankruptcy proceedings (represented by the first number). \nC6/1/131\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 132 - claimant’s claim in an appropriate case, but a defendant’s defence as well: “ according to the \ncontent of Part 3 of Article 16 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, in case of abuse of rights, the \ncourt may deny the person protection. The provision applies not only to the plaintiff, who \nrequests the use of certain means of protection, but also to the defendant, who defends \nhimself against the claim by filing certain objections (including claiming the plaintiff’s \nomission of the statute of limitations) ”.\nDeclarations of invalidity \n At JR/90, we disagree as to whether it is relevant to the Bank’s claim in unjust enrichment \nthat the Bank has not sought declarations that the various purported agreements in the chain \nof transactions between the Bank and Defendant Suppliers are invalid.  \n My view is that such declarations are unnecessary; it is sufficient for the Bank to show that \nthe Defendant Suppliers lacked sufficient legal grounds for acquiring the Unreturned \nPrepayments because, for example, the Relevant Supply Agreements are (i) void, or (ii) it \nwould be an abuse of rights for the Defendant Suppliers to rely on the purported validity of \nvarious agreements in the chain where those agreements were part of the same tortious \nscheme. If the Relevant Supply Agreements are void, they are void by operation of law and \na declaration of the court is not required (Beketov 8/32 and 269; paragraphs 31 to 41 above).  \n My view is supported by the Plenary Resolution of the High Commercial Court of Ukraine \n“On Some Issues of the Invalidation of Transactions (Commercial Contracts)” No. 11 dated \n29 May 2013, where the court held that “ if a claimant refers to the voidness of the transaction \nin substantiation of another claim brought, the court may not refer to the absence of a court \ndecision establishing such transaction void, but instead must assess the relevant arguments \nof the claimant ”115. In other words, for purposes of bringing an unjust enrichment claim in \nwhich it is alleged that the acquisition of the enrichment was pursuant to a void agreement, \nthe claimant is not required first to bring a separate claim seeking to confirm the voidness of \nthe transaction. \n Mr Nahnybida disagrees with me, but he does not put forward any coherent reason for his \ncontrary position.

He simply repeats, at JR/90.2, that if the Relevant Loans are valid, then \nthe Bank would have no claim in unjust enrichment against the Defendant Suppliers.\n115  This position was supported by, for example, the Resolution of the High Commercial Court in case \n904/5081/16, dated 20 May 2017. \nC6/1/132\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 133 - Parties to the proceedings \n At JR/91, we disagree as to whether it is necessary for the Borrowers to be party to the \nBank’s unjust enrichment claim against the Defendant Suppliers. At Beketov 8/270-271, I \nexplained that the Borrowers do not need to be party to this claim. \n Mr Nahnybida’s statement of disagreement, at JR/91.2, suggests that his disagreement \narises from his view that where a transaction is alleged to be invalid, the parties to that \ntransaction must be joined to the claim. As I have addressed at paragraphs 42 to 51 above, \nhowever, even assuming that Ukrainian (rather than English) procedural law will govern the \nquestion of who are the necessary parties to the Bank’s claims, this is not the case where \n(as here) the relevant transactions are alleged to be void and the Bank is not seeking to \napply the consequences of their invalidity against the transaction counterparties.\nRemedies  \n At JR/93, we disagree as to whether an acquirer liable in unjust enrichment to return money \nto a victim can be required to pay both (i) interest for use of the victim’s money, and (ii) \ncompensation for the victim’s lost profits. This issue was not addressed at Beketov 8.  \n Mr Nahnybida’s position is that, in a case involving unjust enrichment in the form of money, \nthe acquirer, pursuant to Article 1214(2), can be required to pay interest on the use of the \nvictim’s funds (which under Article 625 of the Civil Code will be at the rate of 3%116), but \ncannot also be required to make a payment in respect of profits pursuant to Article 1214(1). \n Article 1214(1), however, is not relevant as it concerns the acquirer’s potential liability to give \nrestitution of the profits that the acquirer received (or could have received) from the unjustly \nacquired property from the moment that the acquirer learned or should have learned of the \nlack of sufficient legal basis for their enrichment. What is at issue, however, is whether the \nacquirer can be required to compensate the victim for the profits that the victim could have \nreceived if they had retained use of their money. \n In my view, in an appropriate case and subject to certain requirements as discussed below, \na successful claimant in unjust enrichment can recover both 3% interest under Articles \n116  Article 625 of the Civil Code is discussed at Beketov 8/325-330 and in Section J below. \nC6/1/133\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 134 - 1214(2) and 625 of the Civil Code and lost profits pursuant to the general rules on damages \nset out at Article 22 of the Civil Code, subject to there being no double recovery.  \n At Beketov 8/108, I explained that the general rules on damages contained in Article 22 \napply to both contractual and non-contractual claims. For the avoidance of doubt, this \nincludes claims in unjust enrichment. For example, in its Decision dated 28 May 2021 in \ncase No. 469/949/20, South Agro Invest LLC v Person 2 , the Berezanskyi District Court of \nthe Mykolaiv region considered an unjust enrichment claim in which the claimant had paid \nfive years of rent to the defendant under a lease of a land plot to which the defendant was \nfound to have no legal entitlement.

In addition to seeking to recover the defendant’s unjust \nenrichment (i.e. the rental payments), the claimant claimed 3% interest and inflationary \nlosses under Article 625 of the Civil Code as well as the sum of UAH 27,874.10 for material \nexpenses under Article 22 (in the form of various fees incurred by the claimant in connection \nwith the lease). The District Court allowed all such claims117: \n“Therefore, according to the decision … in case No. 469/178/18, Person_2 did not acquire \nownership of the land plot ... and therefore unlawfully leased it to South Agro Invest LLC \nunder a land lease agreement dated 6 December 2018, and, therefore, unjustly acquired … \nthe rent for 5 years in the amount of UAH 97,757.35. \n… Since the Defendants unjustly acquired the funds belonging to the claimant, unlawfully \nused them, therefore they should return the funds they received in the amount of UAH \n97,757.35 and in accordance with Articles 1214, 536, 625 of the Civil Code of Ukraine pay \ninterest for the use of them. \n… With regard to execution and state registration of the land lease agreement dated 6 \nDecember 2018, the Claimant suffered additional material expenses (losses) in the form of \npaying the amount of VAT and military fee in the amount of UAH 23,680.29 and 90 00 UAH \nwere paid as administrative fee for state registration of rights to real estate. \nAlso, with regard to the adoption by the Commercial Court of the Mykolaiv region of the \ndecision … in case No. 915/1994/19, the Claimant was forced to pay a judicial and executive \nfees in the total amount of UAH 4,103 80. \n… The Claimant suffered material damage in the amount of UAH 27,874.10, which, on the \nbasis of Article 22 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, must be compensated in full ”. \n The particular provision of Article 22 that permits recovery of a victim’s lost profits is Article \n22(2), which allows for the recovery of “ income that a person could actually receive in normal \ncircumstances, if his right was not violated (loss of  profit) ”. In my view, such lost profits may \n117  As no appeal was filed against this decision, it is final and binding. \nC6/1/134\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 135 - be recovered (in addition to 3% interest) provided that (i) the test for recovering lost profits \nunder Article 22 is met; and (ii) there is no double recovery.  \n As regards the test for recovering lost profits, in its Resolution dated 30 September 2021 in \ncase No. 922/3928/20 the Supreme Court stated:  \n“45. Consequently, in order to apply such a measure of liability as the recovery of losses in \nthe form of lost profits, it is necessary to have all the elements of a civil (commercial) offense: \n1) unlawful conduct of a person (debtor); 2) damage caused by such a person; 3) a causal \nrelationship between the unlawful conduct of the person and the damage; 4) the fault of the \nperson who caused the damage, including the establishment of measures taken by the \ncreditor to obtain such benefit. In the absence of one of the elements of a civil offense, \nliability for damages in the form of lost profits does not arise ”118.\n Accordingly, in a case of unjust enrichment where the acquirer has acted without fault, no \nliability for the victim’s lost profits should arise. But where the acquirer, in addition to \nreceiving an enrichment without sufficient legal basis, has acted with fault and has unlawfully \ncaused harm to the victim, then the victim’s lost profits may be recoverable (and, in such \ncirc"}

But where the acquirer, in addition to \nreceiving an enrichment without sufficient legal basis, has acted with fault and has unlawfully \ncaused harm to the victim, then the victim’s lost profits may be recoverable (and, in such \ncircumstances, the unjust acquirer also would likely be liable in tort). \n So if, for example, a claimant can demonstrate that he could have invested the funds that \nwere acquired by the defendant without sufficient legal grounds at 5% interest119, then upon \nsucceeding on an unjust enrichment claim against that defendant the claimant could, in my \nview, recover both: \n 3% interest pursuant to Articles 1214(2) and 625 of the Civil Code, plus  \n 5% interest representing the claimant’s lost profit pursuant to Article 22(2) of the Civil \nCode, although this would: \n depend upon the test for recovering lost profits being satisfied; and \n be reduced to 2% to ensure the claimant does not double recover. \n118  The Supreme Court remanded the case for a new trial and the proceedings are currently before the court \nof appeal. \n119  If there is no evidence that the claimant would have otherwise earned interest on the amount of unjust \nenrichment, then he will be entitled to 3% interest in any event pursuant to Articles 1214(2) and 625 of the \nCivil Code. \nC6/1/135\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 136 -  Mr Nahnybida’s view is that in such a case, the victim can only ever recover 3% interest. \nThis is because, in his view, where the property acquired without sufficient legal grounds is \nmoney, “ interest is treated as the lost profit ” (Nahnybida 3/190). But as I have noted above, \nMr Nahnybida is here referring to the acquirer’s profits payable to the victim under Article \n1214(1). The academic commentary and court practice he relies upon at Nahnybida 3/194-\n195 also relate to the issue of whether the acquirer can be liable for both 3% interest under \nArticle 1214(2) and 625 and paying over the acquirer’s profits under Article 1214(1), and are \nthus irrelevant.  \nH. COMPETITION OFCLAIMS \n The experts’ points of agreement on this subject are set out at JR/96. There are two areas \nof disagreement, concerning; \n the extent to which, in general, claims in tort and/or unjust enrichment may be brought \nwhere a contractual relationship exists between the parties; and  \n specifically, the extent to which a claim in tort can be brought against a bank executive, \nbased on breach of their fiduciary duties, if that executive has a contract of employment \nor services with the bank. \nPreclusion of tort and unjust enrichment claims in general\n As regards the first area of disagreement, at JR/95, my view, as set out at Beketov 8/277-\n280, is that: \n where multiple causes of action are available to a claimant arising out of a particular set \nof facts, then the claimant generally will be free to choose which cause(s) of action will \nbe pursued. Further in this regard, I would refer to the Supreme Court’s Resolution \ndated 24 April 2019 in case No. 295/11278/17, where the court stated:  \n“… the plaintiff has the right to choose the path to achieve the ultimate goal - the \nrestoration of the infringed right, i.e., to choose a more favourable claim and overcome \nthe restrictions imposed on another claim based on the same facts, including by filing a \nvindication claim, so the arguments of the cassation appeal – that the plaintiff has \nchosen the wrong remedy, since the appropriate remedy is invalidation of transactions \non the basis of which the defendant acquired ownership of the disputed apartment – \nare unfounded ”;and \nC6/1/136\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 137 -  where a valid contract is in place between the claimant "}

If both these \ncriteria are not met, in my view the contract will not provide a defence to the tort or \nunjust enrichment claim120.  \n In further support of the above I would refer to the Supreme Court’s Resolution dated 13 \nJuly 2022 in case No. 751/11479/16-ts, in which the claimant, Person 1, sued JSC \nChernigivgaz, which supplied natural gas to Person 1’s apartment, after a fire broke out in \nthe apartment as a result of a gas leak from a pipeline that Chernigivgaz failed to properly \nservice. Notwithstanding that there was a gas supply contract in place between the parties, \nwhich inter alia required Chernigivgaz to provide timely and high quality maintenance and \nrepair services, the Supreme Court held Chernigivgaz liable in tort under Article 1166 for \nloss caused by the fire: \n“the appellate court, partially satisfying [the claimant’s] claim against Chernihivgaz JSC, \ncame to the correct conclusion that it was Chernihivgaz JSC that was responsible for the \nfire in the residential building ADDRESS_1, which occurred on 2 July 2014, due to the poor \nperformance of the latter’s duties, established by court decisions that have entered into \nforce in cases No. 750/1874/16-ts, No. 750/6224/17 and No. 750/3153/19. Therefore, in \nthe presence of the fault of JSC Chernihivgaz established by court decisions, the latter, in \naccordance with the provisions of Articles 1166 and 1192121 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, \nmust compensate the property damage caused to the claimant. JSC Chernihivgaz did not \nrefute its lack of fault with proper and admissible evidence ”.\n120  Furthermore, and for the avoidance of doubt, if the only contract in place is not between the claimant and \ndefendant to a tort or unjust enrichment claim, but is instead between the claimant or defendant, on the \none hand, and a third party on the other, then that contract cannot preclude the claimant’s tort or unjust \nenrichment claim against the defendant. \n121  Article 1192 of the Civil Code addresses compensation in kind. It provides: “ 1. Unless otherwise \nestablished by law, taking into account the circumstances of the case, the court, at the choice of the victim, \nmay oblige the person who caused damage to the property to compensate it in kind (handover an item of \nthe same type and quality, repair the damaged item, etc.) or compensate damages in full. The amount of \ndamages to be compensated to the victim is determined in accordance with the real value of the lost \nproperty at the time of the hearing of the case or the performance of the work necessary to restore the \ndamaged item ”. \nC6/1/137\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 138 -  Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida’s statement of disagreement (JR/95.2-3) contains three \nparts. \n First, they say that “ for harm caused by the non-performance of a contract, the only proper \nca"}

I could agree with this statement \nonly to the extent that, in respect of any potential tort or unjust enrichment claim that might \nalso arise, the conditions outlined in paragraph 352(b) are met, but, in any event, this \nstatement misses the point that on the Bank’s case (i) the various purported contracts at \nissue (including the Relevant Loans and Relevant Supply Agreements) are void, and (ii) the \nharm suffered by the Bank, for which it claims compensation by way of its tort claim, was \nnot caused by non-performance of these purported contracts but by the tortious conduct of \nthe Defendants acting together, whose joint actions to cause harm to the Bank involved inter \nalia putting these purported contracts in place. For completeness, I note that I would reach \nthe same conclusion even if the Relevant Loans and Relevant Supply Agreements were \nvalid, as it would still be the case that the harm suffered by the Bank was, on its case, the \nresult of the Defendants’ tortious conduct rather than non-performance of those contracts \n(see also paragraphs 207 to 209 above). \n Secondly, they say that “ [a] tort claim, if raised in such circumstances, would be dismissed \nby a Ukrainian court ”. The absoluteness of this conclusion is undermined by Mr Alyoshin’s \nstatement at Alyoshin 1/173 that it is a “ generally recognised principle of Ukrainian law that\ntortious liability can usually only exist in the absence of a contractual relationship ”, but in any \nevent, I disagree. My view is as stated at paragraph 352(b) above, which accords with what \nthe Supreme Court said in the Minudobreniya JSC v. Ukrainian Railways JSC  case quoted \nat Beketov 8/278:  \n“there may be events where parties are involved in a contractual relationship, but the harm \ncaused by one party to the other is not connected with the performance of an obligation \narising out of the contract. In the circumstances, a decision on the dispute should rely on the \ncompensation provisions applicable to non-contractual harm as contained in the Ukrainian \nCivil Code and the Ukrainian Commercial Code, whether there is a contract or not ”122. \n122  Decision of the Kyiv Commercial Court dated 28 March 2019, case No. 910/14469/18, Minudobreniya JSC \nv.

But I do not see how this \nstatement is of any relevance to the present case, where there is no relevant contractual \nrelationship between the Bank and the Defendant Suppliers. \n123  Article 1167 of the Civil Code governs when damages for non-pecuniary loss may be recovered. \n124  Article 1195 of the Civil Code governs compensation for mutilation or other damage to health: “ 1. A natural \nor legal person who has caused damage by mutilation or other health damage to a natural person is obliged \nto compensate the victim for the earnings (income) lost by him as a result of the loss or reduction of \nprofessional or general working capacity, as well as to compensate additional costs caused by the need \nfor enhanced food, spa treatment, purchase of medicines, prosthetics, third-party care, etc. … ”. \n125  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 4 June 2021, case No. 753/21343/14-ts, PJSC Ukrsibbank v. \nPersons 1-8 . \n126  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 8 April 2020, case No. 607/16993/18, Person 1 v.

This is because the absence of sufficient legal grounds for the \nDefendant Suppliers’ receipt of the Unreturned Prepayments would be established if, for \nexample: (i) the Relevant Supply Agreements (alone) are void, or (ii) it would be an abuse \nof rights for the Defendant Suppliers to rely upon the purported validity of the Relevant \nSupply Agreements and/or Relevant Loans as providing them with a lawful basis to have \nreceived those prepayments.  \nThe First and Second Defendant’s employment contracts\n At JR/97, Mr Alyoshin and I disagree as to the circumstances in which a bank \nexecutive/officer who has a contract of employment or services with their bank can be liable \nin tort for conduct that breaches their fiduciary duties under Article 92(3) of the Civil Code, \nArticle 63 of the JSC Law and Articles 42 and 43 of the Law on Banks.  \n Mr Alyoshin’s stark position is that “ a bank cannot bring claims in tort against such an \nexecutive/officer in such circumstances ”.

If, therefore, the First and Second Defendants are \nfound to have had contracts of employment or services with the Bank during the \nMisappropriation, it appears that Mr Alyoshin’s view would be that (i) the Bank’s current tort \nclaim against them would be precluded; (ii) the Bank would be limited to suing them for non-\nperformance of their contractual employment or service obligations; and (iii) such a claim \nwould be subject to any limitations on liability provided for in the contracts or their governing \nlaw (JR/97.2). \n The incorrectness of Mr Alyoshin’s view is plain from the Supreme Court authorities I rely \nupon at Beketov 8/281-284127, including as regards the potential dual status of bank \nexecutives as both fiduciaries and employees.  \n127  In addition, I would refer to the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 24 November 2021 in case No. \n658/2337/20, which stated, in the context of a claim under Article 1212: “ At the same time, the mere \nexistence of an agreement between the parties is not a sufficient basis for classifying any legal relationship \nthat arises between these parties as contractual. In order to recognise the relevant obligations between \nthe contracting parties as contractual, it is necessary to establish the fact of their occurrence on the basis \nof the terms and conditions and for the performance of the relevant agreement. … ”.  \nC6/1/140\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 141 -  These authorities also include the Supreme Court’s Resolution dated 25 May 2021 in the \nUkoopspilka Bank case128, which Mr Alyoshin attempts to address at Alyoshin 1/182. I do \nnot consider any of the points he makes in this paragraph to be compelling, nor do I believe \nhis position is lent any weight by the existence of a dissenting opinion given by four of the \n18 Supreme Court judges who heard the case (as I explained at Beketov 8/footnote 90). To \nthe contrary, the existence of this dissenting opinion removes any doubt as to whether the \nissue of whether the bank executives in that case (who were found liable in tort by 14 of 18 \nSupreme Court judges on the basis of their breach of fiduciary duty) had employment/service \ncontracts with the bank, and if so whether this was a relevant factor to be taken into account, \nwas considered by the Supreme Court129. \nI. LIMITATION \n The experts’ points of agreement on this subject are set out at JR/98-100, 103, 105, 107-\n108, and 110.  \nTime from which limitation starts to run \nInterpretation of Article 261 of the Civil Code \n At JR/101, the experts disagree as to my evidence at Beketov 8/287-292, where I explained \nthat although Article 261 of the Civil Code (“ Article 261 ”) provides that the limitation period \napplicable to the Bank’s claims begins to run from the date when the claimant either had \nactual or constructive knowledge of (i) a violation of its right, or (ii) the person who violated \nsuch right, Ukrainian court practice recently has shifted towards interpreting the underlined \nword ‘or’ as ‘and’. In my view, therefore, limitation will begin to run when a claimant has both \nknowledge of the breach and the identity of the person who committed the breach.  \n Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida do not agree. They insist that such interpretation would \nimpermissibly contradict the statutory language of Article 261 and would be inconsistent with \ncourt practice (JR/101.2).

In particular: \n according to Article 9 of the Constitution of Ukraine, international treaties that are in \nforce and to which the Ukrainian Parliament has agreed to be bound (such as the \nECHR), form part of the national legislation of Ukraine. A similar provision is contained \nin Article 19(1) of the Law of Ukraine “On International Treaties of Ukraine” (the \n“Treaties Law ”) and Article 10(1) of the Civil Code;   \n Article 19(2) of the Treaties Law provides that if an international treaty of Ukraine \nestablishes rules other than those provided for in relevant acts of legislation of Ukraine, \nthen the rules of the international treaty shall be applied. A similar provision is contained \nin Article 10(2) of the Civil Code;  \n Article 17(1) of the Law “On the Execution of Judgments and Application of the Case \nLaw of the European Court of Human Rights” provides that “ Courts apply the \nConvention and the practice of the Court as a source of law when considering cases ”, \nand Article 19 of the same Law provides for an ongoing, systematic review of Ukrainian \nlaws and by-laws for the purposes of ensuring compliance with the ECHR and caselaw \nof the European Court of Human Rights; and \n the various Procedural Codes provide for the ECHR and case law of the European \nCourt of Human Rights to be applied by the courts130. \n I have also identified a further case that supports my view. In case No. 910/15607/19, Private \nenterprise “T ER ES LEASING” v PJSC Ukrainian Railways , the claimant had leased rail \ncars to OJSC Leasing Company Ukrtransleasing in 2007, which subleased the rail cars to \n130  For example, Article 11(4) of the Commercial Procedural Code provides: “ When considering a case, the \nCourt applies the [ECHR] and its protocols, ratified by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, and the case law \nof the European Court of Human Rights as a source of law ”.

The \nlease agreements pursuant to which the defendant possessed the rail cars then expired in \n2015 and 2016, but it was only in 2019 that the claimant discovered that its rail cars were in \nthe defendant’s possession. The claimant then sought to reclaim its property from the \ndefendant, which raised a limitation defence, contending that the three year limitation period \nhad started to run in 2015 when the claimant’s lease agreement had expired in 2018 (and it \ndid not receive its property back), and so had expired. The Northern Commercial Court of \nAppeal rejected the limitation defence, finding that “ The claimant became aware of the \nproperty in the possession of the defendant only in 2019 … ” and ruling as follows: \n“The presumption that an owner is able to, and has the duty to, know about the status of \nhis property rights, which presumption is based on the principles of exercising a right of \nownership (such as that ‘ownership obliges’) does not rule out (when an owner’s absolute \nrights are violated, and in contrast to relative (binding) legal relationships) a possible time \ngap between such violation and the time the person whose right was violated becomes \naware thereof. The injured party, having no idea of the identity of the violator (defendant), \nis procedurally unable to bring a legal action and, accordingly, to protect his rights and \nlegally protected interests. \nGiven that the claimant’s claims against the defendant are related to protecting his absolute \nright (right of ownership), and that there is no binding relationship between the parties, a \ndetermination as to when the lease expired would not be sufficient for the limitation period \nto begin running. Only a determination as to both when that happened and when the \nclaimant became aware of the identity of the actual property possessor would constitute \nthe commencement of the limitation period ”131. \n The Court of Appeal concluded: “ the limitation period began in 2019 and at the time of the \nclaimant’s filing to the Commercial Court of Kyiv had not expired ”.  \n I should note that on 20 April 2021132, the Supreme Court overturned the above Resolution \nand underlying first instance decision on grounds relating to the judge’s inadequate \ninvestigation and analysis of the relevant facts: “ the court of first instance did not provide a \nproper legal assessment of the leasing/subleasing agreements, as a result of which it did \nnot determine in what way the disputed movable property left the possession of the claimant \nfor the use of another person and whether there was a claimant’s will to dispose his property \nin this way, and depending on this did not clarify the nature of the disputed legal relationship ”. \nThe case was remanded for a new trial and was subsequently settled.

{"start": 385000, "text": " Commercial Court of Appeal as \nregards the need for a claimant to know the identity of the defendant before limitation will \nstart to run, as I have explained above.  \nKnowledge required to bring a tort claim \n At JR/102, Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida disagree with my evidence at Beketov 8/294 that \nin order for limitation to start running on a tort claim, the claimant must have knowledge of \nfacts or matters sufficient to allow them to file a valid claim at court alleging all four elements \nof tort liability under Article 1166, i.e. unlawful conduct, harm, causation and fault. (In this \ncontext, it is important to note that fault is presumed upon showing unlawful conduct causing \nharm – see Beketov 8/173).  \n Their contrary view (JR/102.2) appears to be based on a simple recitation of the wording of \nArticle 261 of the Civil Code, i.e. that limitation begins to run from the date when the claimant \nhad actual or constructive knowledge of either (i) a violation of its right, or (ii) the person who \nviolated such right. As I have explained above, this interpretation of Article 261 does not \naccount for recent court practice and, in my view, is outdated and incorrect.  \n Furthermore, I do not see how a claimant can be said to have knowledge of a tortious \nviolation of its right unless it has knowledge of unlawful conduct causing harm (giving rise to \na presumption of the fourth element, fault). My view is supported by the Supreme Court’s \nruling of 29 September 2021 in case No. 753/2965/20, DGF v Drobiazko Anatolii , that \nlimitation starts to run from the moment the claimant reliably learns about “ the circumstances \nof the violations of his rights and interests as a result of the wrongful actions of [the \ndefendant], as well as the amount of the harm ”, i.e. all the circumstances giving rise to its \nclaim. The Supreme Court stated as follows: \n“Since the objective possibility of a person to know about the circumstances of violation of \nhis rights is needed to determine when the limitation starts running, the Supreme Court \nconsiders the court’s conclusions that from the date of entry into force of the criminal verdict \nof the Kyiv Court of Appeal of 13 March 2017 in case No. 761/30783/13-k the plaintiff \nbecame reliably aware of the circumstances of the violation of his rights and interests as a \nresult of the wrongful actions of PERSON_1, as well as the amount of the harm. Similar \nconclusions are set out in the Supreme Court’s decision of 1 September 2020 in case No. \n700/460/17 ”.\n As the underlined wording shows, it was only on 13 March 2017 that the claimant became \naware of the circumstances of the violation of its rights, which included the unlawful conduct \nC6/1/144\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 145 - of Person 1, the amount of the harm suffered, and the fact that the harm resulted from \nPerson 1’s unlawful conduct. The Defendant’s limitation defence, which was that time had \nstarted running from the moment the DGF made a criminal complaint to the authorities, was \nnot accepted133.  \n I would also mention the English High Court case PJSC Tatneft v Kolomoisky and \nBogolyubov  (Case No: CL-2016-000172), in which one of the issues in dispute was the \ndegree of knowledge required to start limitation running under Article 200 of the Civil Code \nof the Russian Federation for purposes of a tort claim under Article 1064 of that Code134. \nUnder Article 200, limitation runs “ from the day when the person knew or should have known \nabout the violation of his right and about who is the proper defendant in the claim for the \nprotection of this right ”. In Tatneft ,the High Court concluded (at paragraphs 55-56 of the \njudgment): \n“Accordingly, in my view, “knowledge” for this purpose is a belief that a violation of right has \noccurred which goes beyond mere speculation but knowledge is distinct from evidence and \na claimant can have knowledge even though it does not have evidence which would prove \nthe case "}

Whilst Mr Alyoshin and I agree that \n133  The Defendant’s arguments regarding limitation are recorded in the preceding Resolution of the Court of \nAppeal dated 29 September 2020. \n134  Article 1064 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation is similar in terms to Article 1166 of the Civil Code \nof Ukraine. It provides: “ General Bases of Liability for the Causing of Harm; 1. Harm caused to the person \nor property of a citizen and also harm caused to the property of a legal person shall be subject to \ncompensation in full by the person who has caused the harm...; 2. The person who has caused harm shall \nbe freed from compensation for the harm if he proves that the harm was caused not by his fault. A statute \nmay provide for compensation for the harm even in the absence of fault of the person who caused the \nharm.; 3. Harm caused by lawful actions shall be subject to compensation in the cases provided by a \nstatute. Compensation for harm may be refused if the harm was caused at the request, or with the consent, \nof the victim, and the actions of the person who caused the harm do not violate the moral principles of \nsociety. ” \nC6/1/145\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 146 - there is no test under Ukrainian law as to the quality of knowledge a claimant must have to \nstart the limitation period running (JR/100.3), in our respective reports we made the following \nobservations: \n at Beketov 8/296, I said that “ mere suspicion of the presence of facts or matters ” would \nnot amount to knowledge for purposes of starting a limitation period running; and \n at Alyoshin 1/279, Mr Alyoshin said that “ a good faith belief that the claimant’s rights \nhave been violated ” would suffice to start limitation running.  \n Mr Alyoshin offers no authority for his above statement, and it is also not clear what meaning \nhe attributes to “ a good faith belief ”. To the extent he would intend his statement above to \ncontradict my own, I disagree. My position is supported by the Supreme Court’s Resolution \nin DGF v Drobiazko Anatolii , discussed above, on the basis that I consider it reasonable to \nassume that the DGF must have had a good faith belief that the rights of the bank (for which \nit was acting as liquidator) had been violated when it made a criminal complaint to the \nauthorities, yet this was found to be insufficient to start limitation running. \n In further support of my view that a mere suspicion will not amount to knowledge sufficient \nto start limitation running, I would refer to the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 27 \nDecember 2019 in case No. 912/3644/17, which states: \n“In accordance with the provisions of Art. 261 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, the beginning of \nthe limitation period coincides with the emergence of the interested party’s right to sue, ie \nthe ability to enforce their right through the court. \nTo determine the moment of the occurrence of the right to sue, it is imp"}

First, the \nSupreme Court in this Resolution appears simply to have cited Article 261, which uses the word “or”, \nwithout considering how Article 261 is to be interpreted and applied. Secondly, in the part of this Resolution \nC6/1/146\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 147 - although under the existing circumstances should have known about it, the statute of \nlimitation starts from the day when a person should have learned about the violation of his \nright. \nThe possibility of learning about the violation of the right or the person who violated it, in this \ncase should be understood as the contemplated inevitability of informing [i.e., acquiring of \ninformation by] the person about such circumstances, or the existence of certain obligations \non the part of that person, as the measure of this person’s proper conduct, as a result of \nwhich he would be able to learn about the relevant illegal actions and the perpetrator. \nA similar legal position is set out in the decisions of the Supreme Court of 21.03.2018 in \ncase № 57/314-6 / 526-2012, of 03.04.2018 in case №910/31767/15, of 17.07.2018 in case \n№911/4006/16. \nTherefore, when determining the beginning of the statute of limitation, the court should \nascertain and take into account the circumstances both with respect to when the person \nlearned about and when the person could have learned (had the opportunity to learn) about \nthe violation of his right in their conjunction, as mandatory components of determining the \nbeginning of the limitation period ”. \n The underlined wording in the extract above in my view indicates that sufficient knowledge \nwill be found to exist where the claimant has either direct knowledge of the relevant facts \nand matters (actual knowledge) or their acquisition of such knowledge should have been \ninevitable (constructive knowledge).

They consider \nrecourse to the abuse of rights rule to be “ unnecessary and inappropriate ” in view of \nthat applied Article 261 to the facts of the case, the Supreme Court found that the claimant had knowledge \nof both the violation of its right and the identity of the person who violated its right (“ [a]lso, the courts note \nthat the plaintiff knew about the sale of the disputed property on 26 April 2011 and the actual removal of \nthe disputed property from his possession and about the person who violated his right … ”), which in my \nview indicates that the Supreme Court considered it necessary to consider whether both branches of Article \n261 were satisfied. \nC6/1/147\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 148 - claimants having recourse to Article 267(5) of the Civil Code, pursuant to which the courts \nmay disapply a limitation period where there are valid reasons to do so (JR/104.2). \n That the abuse of rights rule can be applied to defeat a limitation defence has now been \nconfirmed by the Supreme Court’s Resolution dated 11 November 2021 in case No. \n910/8482/18 (910/4866/21)136, PJSC Siryus-Bud vs. Department of Enforcement of \nDecisions of the Department of the State Executive Service of the Ministry of Justice et al . \nIn that case, the claimant’s property (real estate) was mortgaged, foreclosed against and \nthen alienated by one defendant through a fraudulent process involving a purported sale of \nthe property at auction at a very significant undervalue followed by a rapid succession of \ntransfers by which the property came to be owned by another defendant. The defendants \nraised a limitation defence against the claimant’s claim to recover the property, but the \ndefence was rejected on the basis that, in view of the defendants’ actions in fraudulently \ncausing the claimant’s property to be transferred away, it was an abuse of right for the \ndefendants to apply to strike out the claim on grounds of limitation:   \n“94.4. The statute of limitations is an institution of substantive and not procedural law and \ncannot be restored (renewed) in case of its expiration, but the plaintiff is entitled to receive \njudicial protection if the reasons for missing the statute of limitations are recognized as valid \n(part 5 of Article 267 of the Civil Code of Ukraine). \n94.5. For these reasons, the application of the statute of limitations is subject to the general \nprinciples of substantive civil law, which constitutes fundamental rules as well as the rules \nof direct action (Supreme Court Resolution of 25 January 2021 case No. 758/10761/13-ts), \nincluding general provisions on fairness, good faith and reasonableness as a general \nstandard of conduct for participants in civil relations. \n94.6. In this regard, this significantly weakens the position of the defendants who are \ninvolved in fraud transactions and are protected from the claim for invalidation of such \ntransaction and derivative claims by reference to the omission of the statute of limitations by \nthe plaintiff, because according to the content of Part 3 of Article 16 of the Civil Code of \nUkraine, in case of abuse of rights, the court may deny the person protection.

The provision \napplies not only to the plaintiff, who requests the use of certain means of protection, but also \nto the defendant, who defends himself against the claim by filing certain objections (including \nclaiming the plaintiff’s omission of the statute of limitations) ”. \n136  The case has two case numbers because the claimant’s claim (represented by the second number) was \nmade within bankruptcy proceedings (represented by the first number). \nC6/1/148\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 149 - Burden of proof  \n At JR/106, Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida disagree with my view that because each party \nin Ukrainian civil proceedings generally bears the burden of proving facts and matters upon \nwhich they rely, therefore when a defendant raises a limitation defence, the burden of proof \nlies on the defendant to establish facts and matters showing that the claimant had or could \nhave had sufficient knowledge (for purposes of starting the limitation period running) at some \ndate more than three years prior to commencing its claim.  \n Instead, Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida consider that where a limitation defence is raised, \nthe burden of proof will lie on the claimant to show that it did not have sufficient knowledge \nto start limitation running on a date three years prior to commencing its claim. They say that \nthis burden lies on the claimant because it will be presumed to have been aware of the state \nof his property rights (Alyoshin 1/282). \n At Alyoshin 1/282, Mr Alyoshin cites two cases to support his position: (i) the Resolution of \nthe Supreme Court dated 20 May 2019 in case No. 183/1474/15, in which the claimant \nbrought a claim to invalidate title documents to an apartment more than 13 years after the \ntitle documents were issued to the defendant, and (ii) the Resolution of the Supreme Court \ndated 13 May 2019 in case No. 754/13456/16-ts, in which the claimant brought a claim to \ninvalidate title documents to a house almost 12 years after the title documents were issued. \nBut both of these cases, despite being relied upon by Mr Alyoshin, fully support my position. \nBoth rulings state: \n“the claimant must also prove the fact that he could not find out about the violation of his \ncivil rights, which also follows from the general rule established by … the Code of Civil \nProcedure of Ukraine with respect to the obligation to prove by the party the facts and \nmatters to which it refers as the basis of its claims or objections. Defendant, on the other \nhand, must prove that information about the violation could have been obtained earlier ”.  \n The Supreme Court thus reiterated the general rule (upon which my position relies) that \neach party bears the burden of proving the facts and matters upon which they rely, and gave \nthe following two examples:  \n a claimant seeking to disapply a limitation period bears the burden of proving that he \ncould not have discovered the violation of his rights any earlier; and \nC6/1/149\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 150 -  a defendant seeking to apply a limitation period bears the burden of proving that the \nclaimant could have obtained sufficient knowledge at an earlier date. \n This is precisely my position as set out at Beketov 8/307. \n In further support of my view, I refer to case No. 910/15607/19, Private enterprise “T ER ES \nLEASING” v PJSC Ukrainian Railways , discussed at paragraph 370 above. In that case, \nlease agreements pursuant to which the defendant possessed the claimant’s rail cars had \nexpired in 2015 and 2016, but it was only in 2019 that the claimant discovered that its rail \ncars were in the defendant’s possession and sued to recover them.

In rejecting the \ndefendant’s limitation defence, the Northern Commercial Court of Appeal observed that the \ndefendant had not discharged its burden of proving that the claimant had known prior to \n2019 that the rail cars were in the defendant’s possession: \n“The appellant [defendant] did not provide evidence of the claimant’s participation in the \ntransfer of property from the State Enterprise “Donetsk Railway” to the PJSC Ukrainian \nRailways, as well as evidence of awareness of the claimant until 2019 that the disputed \nproperty was in the possession of the defendant ”137.\n As a further example, in Person 1 v. Agricultural household Skif O , case No. 923/875/17, a \nclaim was brought in September 2017 challenging a decision taken at a meeting in January \n2013. The claimant claimed that he only learned of the relevant decision in July 2016, \nmeaning that his claim was in time. The defendant raised a limitation defence, and in its \nResolution dated 10 September 2019 the Supreme Court made clear that the defendant had \nfailed to discharge its burden of showing that the claimant could have had sufficient \nknowledge more than three years before filing claim: \n“The local court took into account that the claimant could not became aware about the \nmeeting dated 25 January 2013, because claimant did not perform the duties of the head of \nthe farm since 2013, and the defendant did not prove that in the period from the date of the \ndisputed decision until 23 July 2016 the claimant was aware of the decision. In view of the \nabove, the local court concluded that the claimant did not miss the limitation period on filing \nthe claim to the court to protect its rights, as he became aware on 23 July 2016, and filed a \nclaim on 15 September 2017.\nThe claimant shall also prove the fact that he could not became aware about the violation of \nhis civil rights, which also follows from the general rule established by Article 74 of the \nCommercial Procedure Code of Ukraine, on the obligation of the party to the case to prove \nthe circumstances to which it refers as the basis of its claims and objections.

Mr Alyoshin says such \na test would be “ entirely unclear in its meaning and unpredictable in its application ” (Alyoshin \n1/284), but I do not accept this. The Ukrainian courts regularly resolve important issues, \nsuch as causation and harm for purposes of a tort claim, on a case-by-case basis as \nquestions of fact. \n Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida are instead of the view that questions of attribution of \nknowledge fall to be resolved with reference to Article 92 of the Civil Code, with the result \nthat a lega"}

As Mr Nahnybida \nputs it: “ Under Ukrainian law, the knowledge of the company is the knowledge of the \ndirectors, other bodies of that company, or persons that act in the name of the company on \nthe basis of articles of incorporation or the law ”, and both he and Mr Alyoshin suggest that \nunless a shareholder or beneficial owner of a company also holds a formal position of \nauthority within a company, their knowledge cannot be attributed to that company (Alyoshin \n1/291; Nahnybida 3/77).  \n138  See also Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 8 September 2021 in case No. 910/13609/20 and \nResolution of the Supreme Court dated 22 September 2021 in case No. 922/3403/20.  \n139  In both the Joint Report and this report, the topic of attribution of knowledge is considered solely under the \nmain subject heading “Limitation”. I should make clear, however, that what I and the other experts have \nsaid as regards the attribution of knowledge under Ukrainian law is potentially relevant to (i) limitation-\nrelated issues (e.g. whose knowledge of the Misappropriation is to be attributed to the Bank for the \npurposes of determining when limitation started to run on the Bank’s claims); and/or (ii) issues unrelated \nto limitation (e.g. whether the First and Second Defendants’ knowledge may be attributed to Ukrainian \ncompanies alleged to have been involved in the Misappropriation of which they are alleged to be the \nultimate beneficial owners). For ease of reference, however, I discuss all issues related to attribution in \nthis section. \nC6/1/151\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 152 -  Mr Alyoshin’s view, therefore, is that within a bank, the main individual whose knowledge \nwill be relevant for purposes of determining that bank’s knowledge is the Chairman of the \nExecutive Board (also known as the Management Board), and the knowledge of other \nmanagers and employees may be attributed to the bank (only) when carrying out their \nfunctions within or on behalf of the bank in accordance with the bank’s constituent \ndocuments or a power of attorney (Alyoshin 1/289). Furthermore, because members of a \nbank’s supervisory board are not responsible for the bank’s day-to-day management and do \nnot have any powers to act on the bank’s behalf, therefore My Alyoshin concludes that it is \nnot possible to attribute their knowledge to the bank (Alyoshin 1/290). Mr Nahnybida similarly \nconcludes that the knowledge of someone who indirectly owns a beneficial share of a \ncompany, or who can influence or control the decision-making of that company’s managers \nor officials, cannot be attributed to that company (Nahnybida 3/83). \n I consider this to be an overly formalistic approach to the attribution of knowledge, which \nwould permit the courts to attribute to a company the knowledge of only those individuals \nholding formal positions of authority and only whilst they are carrying out their formal duties. \nSuch an approach would be wholly inconsistent with the many Ukrainian laws that make \nclear that informal methods of exerting decisive influence within a company are equally as \nimportant to consider, for example when identifying a bank’s “ controllers ” under Article 2 of \nthe Law on Banks (see Beketov 8/335-337) or a company’s “ ultimate beneficial owners ” (see \nBeketov 8/354-356).

It stands to reason that the knowledge of a bank’s controller or ultimate \nbeneficial owner should be no less attributable to that bank because that person enjoys \ninformal, rather than formal, methods of influence and control. The common sense approach \nthat, in my view, the Ukrainian courts take to resolving questions of attribution of knowledge \nas matters of fact is sufficiently flexible to ensure that this is the case.  \n My position on attribution of knowledge is fully supported by court practice. At Beketov 8/180, \nI referred to Person 2 v. Nikolitsa et al140, in which the knowledge of a company was \nattributed to its indirect shareholder despite no finding being made that that person exercised \n140  See Resolution of the Kyiv Court of Appeal dated 12 June 2019, case No. 755/12464/17, Person 2 v. \nNikolitsa et al . Part of this Resolution was excluded by the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 25, \nMarch 2020, but this exclusion did not relate to any part of the Court of Appeal’s Resolution upon which I \nrely. In particular, the Supreme Court ruled: “ The Resolution of the Kyiv Appellate Court dated 12 June \n2019 should be changed, excluding from its motivational part the conclusions that ‘in accordance with the \nprovisions of Part 4 of Article 1281 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, the obligation under the credit agreement \nhas terminated, which indicates the termination of the obligation under the mortgage agreement concluded \nto ensure the fulfilment of the obligation under the main contract. Thus, the creditor is deprived of the right \nto foreclose on the subject of the mortgage in the part that belongs to the claimant’. In the other part, \nResolution of the Kyiv Appellate Court dated 12 June is to be left unchanged ”.  \nC6/1/152\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 153 - influence over the company’s affairs. The following three cases further illustrate the courts’ \nwillingness to attribute to a company the knowledge of individuals other than those holding \nformal positions of authority and whilst they are carrying out their formal duties: \n In Kyriachenko v Interkos Plus141, Mr Kyriachenko, a private entrepreneur, went \nbankrupt, and his liquidator sold certain of his real estate to Mr Gurin, who resold it to \nthe defendant Interkos Plus. The sale agreement by which Mr Gurin had acquired the \nproperty was invalidated and Mr Kyriachenko’s new liquidator applied to the court to \nrecover the real estate from Interkos Plus. Interkos Plus defended the case on the basis \nthat it was not aware that the property had been acquired illegally by Mr Gurin and \ntherefore, under Article 330 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, as a bona fide  purchaser it \nshould not have to return the property. The court rejected this defence, finding that \nInterkos Plus should have known that the sale agreement was invalid when it bought \nthe property from Mr Gurin because (i) Mr Gurin was the director of Interkos Plus; and \n(ii) Mr Kyriachenko’s son was the sole shareholder of Interkos Plus. The High \nCommercial Court of Ukraine agreed with the judgment of the Court of Appeal. Whilst \nthe attribution of the knowledge of Interkos Plus’ director to the company accords with \nMr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida’s views, the attribution of knowledge of Interkos Plus’ \nshareholder to the company does not. The case also illustrates that family relations are \nsufficient to support an attribution of knowledge; in this case, knowledge (of the invalidity \nof the agreement b"}

After the \nborrower and bank amended the loan agreement, OrionInvest claimed that its \nguarantee should be terminated on grounds that it was not aware of the amendment \nand had not given its consent. The court found that OrionInvest should have been aware \nof the amendment because it had the same (i) Cypriot beneficial owner and (ii) English \nshareholder as Interglast, neither of whom were found to hold formal positions of \n141  See Resolution of the High Commercial Court of Ukraine dated 2 September 2014, Kyriachenko v Interkos \nPlus, case No. 925/1986/13. \n142  See Resolution of Kyiv Commercial Court of Appeals dated 9 December 2015, OrionInvest v \nUkrGazPromBank , case No. 910/17605/15, which was upheld by Resolution of the High Commercial Court \nof Ukraine dated 16 March 2016. \nC6/1/153\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 154 - authority within OrionInvest. Again, this is inconsistent with Mr Alyoshin and Mr \nNahnybida’s opinion. \n In Nadiia v Lin-Teks143, the Chairman of Nadiia’s Management Board, Mr Yakovenko, \nsigned a sale contract under which property passed from the claimant, Nadiia, to the \ndefendant, Lin-Teks, which was owned by Mr Yakovenko and his son. Nadiia sought to \ninvalidate the contract on grounds that Mr Yakovenko lacked authority to sign the \ncontract and Lin-Teks had been aware of this. The first instance court agreed, finding \nthat Mr Yakovenko had no authority to enter into this contract and that Lin-Teks must \nhave known this fact since Lin-Teks’ shareholders were Mr Yakovenko and his son. The \njudgment was overturned by the appellate court but reinstated on further appeal by the \nHigh Commercial Court of Ukraine144. The case illustrates both that: (i) the knowledge \nof an individual can be attributed to a company even when that individual acts outside \nthe scope of his formal authority, and (ii) family relations are sufficient to support an \nattribution of knowledge, in this case from Mr Yakovenko to his son to Lin-Teks. \n I note that Mr Alyoshin does not cite any court practice in support of his views on this issue \nat Alyoshin 1/283-291, and Mr Nahnybida, at  Nahnybida 3/81, relies upon a single Supreme \nCourt Resolution (case No. 905/1870/20) that establishes only that the intentions of a legal \nentity at the time it enters into a contract are determined by the intentions of the natural \nperson who signed the contract with authority to do so. But the Supreme Court in that case \nwas not asked to consider whether the knowledge of any person other than the contract-\nsigner should be attributed to the company, and in my view the conclusion that knowledge \nof an authorised company representative should be attributed to the company in this \nstraightforward scenario in no way precludes the possibility of attributing the knowledge of \nother persons to a company where it is appropriate as a matter of common sense on the \nfacts to do so (as the cases I have described above illustrate). \n143  See Decision of the Commercial Court of Kyiv dated 19 September 2008, Nadiia v.

Therefore, the statements of the \ndefendant’s representatives that supposedly Lin-Teks could not have been aware of the lack of authority \nare inappropriate and false. … In view of the above, the claimant`s claim for invalidation of the said \nagreement is subject to satisfaction. ”\n144  See Resolution of the High Commercial Court of Ukraine dated 16 February 2009, Nadiia v. Lin-Teks , case \nNo. 3/118-08. \nC6/1/154\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 155 - Knowledge of a fraudster \n The overly formalistic approach of Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida that underlines their \nposition considered above also appears to inform their position on the next point of \ndisagreement at JR/110.3.  \n Whereas I consider that if any person is involved in defrauding a company, then their \nknowledge of the fraud should not be attributed to that company, Mr Alyoshin and \nMr Nahnybida’s view is that only the knowledge of those authorised to act on the company’s \nbehalf (and seeking to defraud it) will be prevented from being attributed to the company on \nthis basis. For all the reasons set out above, I do not agree with their overly formalistic \napproach. \n Further in relation to this issue, I would also note my opinion that where a company is \ndefrauded by its former management, which is then removed and replaced by new \nmanagement, a Ukrainian court determining when the defrauded company acquired \nknowledge sufficient to start limitation running is likely to conclude that this will only be once \nthe new management has had a reasonable period of time to investigate the fraud and \nuncover information and evidence sufficient to allow a claim to be brought.  \n I consider that the facts of the Tavryka Bank Case , discussed at paragraph 184(a)(i) above, \nsupport my opinion in this regard. As recorded in the first instance judgment145, in that case: \n on 20 December 2012, the NBU passed a resolution classifying the defrauded Bank \nTavryka as insolvent;  \n on 20 March 2013, the NBU passed a resolution initiating the liquidation of Bank \nTavryka and appointing an authorised person of the DGF as liquidator; and \n on 23 September 2013, the DGF approved and certified the results of the inventory it \nhad taken, as liquidator, of Bank Tavryka’s assets, which included establishing the \nvalue of those assets. \n It was only on this last date, and not immediately upon the appointment of DGF’s \nrepresentative six months previously, that the applicable three-year limitation period was \n145  Decision of the Kyiv Commercial Court dated 13 March 2019, Case No. 910/12803/18, PJSC Bank Tavryka \nv Person 2 and ors . \nC6/1/155\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 156 - found by the first instance court to have started to run.

The correctness of this finding was \nnot impugned on appeal.  \nFurther comments on Alyoshin 1 \n Lastly on the subject of limitation, I note the following in relation to points made by Mr \nAlyoshin that are not addressed in the Joint Report. \n First, Alyoshin 1/292 cites guidance issued by the Plenum of the High Commercial Court in \nMay 2013 in support of his proposition that “ the limitation period is not interrupted if there is \na change of management and the newly appointed management of the legal entity becomes \naware of the potential claim only after its appointment ”. This guidance appears to relate to a \nsituation where the management of a company knows that the company has a potential \nclaim, but the management is then changed. I agree that in such an unremarkable scenario, \nthe limitation period should not be interrupted. What the guidance does not appear to \nconsider, however, is a situation where the former management only knows that the \ncompany has a potential claim because the former management is itself engaged in \ndefrauding the company. That was the situation considered in the case Striletskyi Step \nMilovskyi zavod rafinovanoyi olii PJSC v. Belovodskyi Elevator LLC , which I discussed at \nBeketov 8/298 and which fully supports my view that, in such a scenario, the fraudster’s \nknowledge should not be attributed to the company so as to start limitation running. \n Secondly, at Alyoshin 1/300-303, Mr Alyoshin seeks to apply the law on limitation to the \nfacts of this case, concluding that limitation began to run when the Relevant Loans were \ndrawn down in 2013-14 and expired in 2016-17, and that the Bank has not pleaded any \nbasis on which the limitation period could be disapplied under Article 267(5) of the Civil \nCode. In my view, Mr Alyoshin’s evidence in this regard goes beyond mere opinion evidence \nand seeks to usurp the court’s function, and I will not seek to do the same by responding \ndirectly to it (suffice to say that I disagree).  \nJ. INTEREST \n The experts’ points of agreement on this subject are set out at JR/111. I address under \nseparate sub-headings below the three areas of disagreement between us, although I am \ninstructed that this will only be relevant for the court to consider if the Bank’s entitlement to \ninterest is governed by Ukrainian law (rather than English law).  \nC6/1/156\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 157 - Does 3% interest under Article 625 of the Civil Code accrue before or after judgment?  \n At JR/112, we disagree as to when the 3% simple interest payable under Article 625 of the \nCivil Code (“ Article 625 ”) begins to accrue in relation to tort and unjust enrichment claims. \nMr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida do not agree with my view that interest will accrue from the \nmoment of the defendant’s infliction of tortious harm or from the moment that the defendant \nis unjustly enriched. Instead, they say interest will accrue only once the claimant has \nobtained judgment (granting the tort or unjust enrichment claim) and the defendant has failed \nto satisfy a demand for payment of compensation / restitution. Essentially, therefore, our \ndispute is as to whether interest under Article 625 accrues before or only after judgment. \n Article 625 provides that interest begins to accrue from the point of delay in fulfilment of the \nrelevant monetary obligation. In my view, the point of delay commences (in relation to a tort \nclaim) when the defendant’s obligation to compensate for harm first arises, and (in relation \nto an unjust enrichment claim) when the defendant’s obligation to return the unjust \nenrichment first arises. \n In relation to tort claims, my view is that the tortfeasor’s obligation to compensate in full any \nharm they cause arises immediately upon causing such harm. Such an obligation to \ncompensate harm arises under Article 1166 by operation of law, and does not depend on \nthe existence of a court decision obliging the tortfeasor to give compens"}

Such an obligation to \ncompensate harm arises under Article 1166 by operation of law, and does not depend on \nthe existence of a court decision obliging the tortfeasor to give compensation. Any eventual \ncourt decision in the claimant’s favour only serves to confirm that the tortfeasor refused to \nvoluntarily compensate the victim for the harm caused. It does not mean that the tortfeasor \nonly became obliged to compensate the harm upon the court saying so.  \n My view above has been supported by the Ukrainian courts. For example, in case No. \n200/13392/13-ts, Motor (Transport) Insurance Bureau of Ukraine v. Person 1 , the Supreme \nCourt stated:  \n“A tort obligation arises from the fact of causing harm (in particular, property damage) and \ncontinues until the moment of its compensation in full to the injured person by the person \nwho caused the harm (Articles 11, 599, 1166 of the Civil Code of Ukraine). The parties to \nthe tort obligation are usually the injured person (creditor) and the tortfeasor (debtor) ”146. \n146  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 10 January 2019, case No. 200/13392/13-ts, Motor (Transport) \nInsurance Bureau of Ukraine v. Person 1 . See also the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 15 \nSeptember 2021, case No. 310/2529/20, Person 1 v. Person 2, Person 3 . \nC6/1/157\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 158 -  In its Resolution dated 19 June 2019 in case No. 703/2718/16-ts,14-241tsс19, Person 1 v \nHead Office of the Pension Fund of Ukraine in the Cherkasy Region , the Grand Chamber of \nthe Supreme Court considered the application of Article 625 in a case where there was a \ndelay in a judgment debtor’s satisfaction of its obligation under a court judgment to pay \ncompensation for moral damages to the claimant. The claimant had asked to recover interest \nunder Article 625 from the date of court judgment, and the lower courts accordingly awarded \ninterest from that date. The Grand Chamber, however, overturned the reasoning of the lower \ncourts, stating:  \n“The Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court considers erroneous the conclusions of the \ncourts that monetary obligations arose between the parties precisely on the basis of the \ncourt’s decision. \nThe obligation is not one that arose from a court decision. This is an obligation to \ncompensate for damage, in which the court’s decision determines the specific amount of \nthe damage caused and states the existence of an obligation between the parties ”.  \n But, because the claimant had not asked to recover interest from any other date, such as \nwhen the moral damage was suffered, the Grand Chamber did not change the lower courts’ \naward.  \n In case No. 910/3987/20, the National Commission for State Regulation of Financial \nServices Markets revoked the claimant’s licences and failed to renew those licences (the \nunlawfulness of which was established by court decision). The claimant had been due to \ncommence licensed activities from 14 March 2017, but could not do so due to revocation of \nits licences, and its licences were not renewed until 29 March 2019. Pursuant to Article 625, \nthe claimant sought interest and inflation losses accruing from 14 March 2017 and the \nSupreme Court, when remitting the case to the court of first instance, did not raise any \nobjection to the claimant’s claim in this regard147. \n My view is also supported by the Supreme Court’s Resolution dated 17 October 2018 in \ncase No. 908/2552/17.

In \nJanuary 2018, during the proceedings, the defendant repaid the amount of the fee to the \nclaimant. The claimant then amended its claim to request inflation losses under Article 625 \ncalculated from October 2016, being the moment of the claimant’s loss / defendant’s \nenrichment. The Supreme Court granted the claim notwithstanding that no judgment had \nbeen made finding that the defendant owed the principal amount to the claimant, thus \nallowing recovery of pre-judgment inflation losses accruing from the moment of the \nclaimant’s loss / defendant’s enrichment. I consider that the Supreme Court’s approach in \nthis Resolution should apply equally to claims for pre-judgment interest under Article 625, \nas well as pre-judgment inflation losses, with any such interest accruing from the date on \nwhich (for purposes of a tort claim) the harm was caused or (for purposes of an unjust \nenrichment claim) the acquirer was enriched.  \n My position in relation to claims in unjust enrichment is further supported by the following \nexamples: \n the Supreme Court’s Resolution of 17 October 2018, in case No. 908/2552/17, which \ninvolved a claim under Article 1212 for return of an unlawfully collected enforcement \nfee.

I consider, therefore, that because a tort obligation \ncertain, predetermined amount (established by law or contract) of property losses in a simplified compared \nto the recovery of damages way; and this simplification is that the creditor (injured party) is not required to \nprove the amount of his losses, in contrast to proving the amount of damages ”.  \n151  That the courts in Ukraine do not have law-making authority, and that the Ukrainian Parliament ( Verkhovna \nRada ) is Ukraine’s sole law-making body in Ukraine, has been recognised, for example in the Resolution \nof the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal dated 4 September 2018, case No. 826/1244/18: “ State power \nin Ukraine is exercised on the basis of its division into legislative, executive and judicial (Article 6 of the \nConstitution of Ukraine). The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, in accordance with the requirements of Article \n75 of the Constitution of Ukraine, is the only legislative body in Ukraine. Thus, the Constitution of Ukraine \nentrusts the function of creating and adopting laws to a single legislative body - the Verkhovna Rada of \nUkraine ”. See further, for example: (i) an article by Professor Oleksandr Liubchyk, “Legal Precedent – \nSource of Law in Ukraine: Yes or No?”, published in Bulletin of Luhansk State University of Internal Affairs \n3rd edition 2020: “ Conclusions on the application of rules of law set out in rulings of the Supreme Court \n(SC) are taken into account by other courts when applying such rules of law.

In my view, this \ncannot be right. The harm suffered by B in the posited scenario, for which it is entitled to be \nfully compensated, includes not only the loss of UAH 100,000 suffered on 1 March 2020, \nbut harm suffered as a result of B being without the UAH 100,000 from the period 1 March \nto 1 December 2020, i.e. interest and inflation losses, which Article 625 is intended to \ncompensate B for. \n In support of his view, Mr Nahnybida relies upon the Supreme Court’s Resolution of 27 May \n2020 in case No. 916/1961/19 (Nahnybida 3/270). This case is irrelevant, however, because \nthe conclusions of the Supreme Court concerned only accruals of  interest in respect of the \nprofit that had been acquired by a defendant from property acquired without sufficient legal \ngrounds. In particular, the case concerned two properties that the defendant acquired from \nthe claimant without sufficient legal grounds. In prior proceedings, the courts had (i) \nestablished that the earliest date on which the defendant could have known that its \nacquisition of each property was without sufficient legal grounds was 1 September 2014 and \n1 January 2016, respectively, and (ii) ordered the defendant to pay to the claimant the profit \nthat the defendant had received from each property starting from those respective dates and \nC6/1/162\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 163 - ending on the dates when the defendant ceased to use the property. This order was made \npursuant to Article 1214(1) of the Civil Code, which provides (in relevant part): \n“A person who has acquired or preserved property without sufficient legal ground shall be \nliable for compensation of all the profits he/she has received or could have received from \nthat property from the time when he/she became aware or could have become aware of \npossession of the property without sufficient legal basis. … ”\n The dates of the relevant court decisions were 10 July 2018 (in case No. 916/2153/17) and \n12 April 2019 (in case No. 916/52/19). \n The claimant then sued (in case No. 916/1961/19) to recover, under Article 625, 3% interest \nand inflation losses in respect of the profits that the defendant had been ordered to pay. The \nclaim for interest covered the periods 1 September 2014 to 31 May 2019 (being the date on \nwhich the defendant ceased to use the first property) and 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2019 \n(being the date on which the defendant ceased to use the second property), but the Supreme \nCourt found that interest was only payable from the date of the court decisions ordering the \ndefendant to pay its profits to the claimant.  \n The Supreme Court reasoned that although Article 1214(1) of the Civil Code identifies the \nperiod of time of usage of property (that has been acquired without sufficient legal ground) \nfor which profits received must be paid, it does not identify the time per"}

For this, the Supreme \nCourt pointed to Article 530(2) of the Civil Code, which provides: \n“If the period (term) for fulfilment of the obligation by the debtor is not defined or determined \nat the moment of filing the claim, the creditor has the right to demand its fulfilment at any \ntime. The debtor must perform such an obligation within 7 days from the date of the claim if \nthe obligation to perform it immediately does not follow from the agreement or acts of civil \nlaw”.\n The Supreme Court held, therefore, that interest was only chargeable on the profit to be paid \nby the defendant to the claimant starting from the date of the court decision ordering such \npayment to be made. However, as noted above, this case involved the application of Article \n625 to a payment obligation arising under Article 1214(1); it did not involve the application \nof Article 625 to an obligation arising under 1212 to return money that has been acquired \nwithout sufficient legal grounds, in relation to which the correct approach, in my view, was \ntaken in the authorities noted at paragraph 416 above.  \nC6/1/163\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 164 -  Lastly in relation to this issue, I note that in its Resolution dated 23 April 2019 in case No. \n918/47/18, the Supreme Court took a third approach, concluding that interest under Article \n625 in relation to a claim in unjust enrichment should accrue from the date falling seven days \nafter the claimant’s demand for payment. The Supreme Court in this case also based its \napproach on Article 530(2) of the Civil Code, which as noted above provides that if the term \nof an obligation is not set by contract or law then it should be performed within seven days \nof the counterparty’s request. Upon expiration of this seven day period, the obligation \nbecomes overdue.  \n I consider that this case underscores that the Supreme Court has not yet developed a \nconsistent approach as to when interest under Article 625 will start to accrue in relation to \ntort and unjust enrichment claims, which I consider to be good reason why the correct \napproach should be identified with reference to the principles I have relied upon above. \nCompound interest \n At JR/113, the experts disagree as to whether the Bank could be entitled to compound \ninterest if it succeeds on its tort and/or unjust enrichment claims.  \n My opinion, expressed at Beketov 8/331-333, is that an award of compound interest may be \nmade under Ukrainian law if a claimant demonstrates that such an award (i) represents a \nfair quantification of the claimant’s lost profit, and/or (ii) is necessary to ensure that the \nclaimant is fully compensated for the harm caused to it.  \n Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida disagree; they consider that compound interest is only \navailable on the basis of express contractual provisions. Their position, as expressed at \nAlyoshin 1/309-310 and Nahnybida 3/273, is little more than a bare denial of the availability \nof compound interest, however, and does not take into consideration: \n the principle that a victim is to be fully compensated for their loss (Articles 1161(1), \n1192(1) and 22(3) of the Civil Code); \n the recoverability of lost profit under Article 22(2)(2) of the Civil Code and expenses \nunder Article 22(2)(1); \n that the quantification of loss under a permitted head of recovery (such as lost profit) is \na question of fa"}

Pursuant to Article 22 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, damages are reimbursed in full if the \ncontract or law does not provide for compensation in a smaller or larger amount. If the person \nwho violated the right received income in this regard, the amount of lost profits to be \nreimbursed to the person whose right was violated may not be less than the income received \nby the person who violated the right. \n66. Thus, the Civil Code of Ukraine provides for the general principle of full compensation \nfor damages, ie the principle that compensation is provided in the amount equivalent to the \ndamage caused, and limitation of property liability is allowed only in exceptional cases \nexpressly provided by law or contract ”. \n I consider the underlined wording in the above extract to indicate that the absence of any \nprovision in Ukrainian law expressly prohibiting compound interest (a point on which I rely) \nis of more significance than the absence of any provision expressly allowing compound \ninterest (a point on which Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida rely). \n Furthermore, it would not, in my view, be contrary to any principle of Ukrainian law for an \naward of compound interest to be made. In this regard, I note that in case No. 796/165/18, \nthe Court of Appeal of Kyiv recognised and granted permission to enforce in Ukraine an \narbitration award made by the Arbitration Court in the Hague that awarded both damages \n(for the defendant Russian Federation’s illegal expropriation of the claimants’ property) as \nwell as “ interest on all sums awarded at the annual twelve-month rate of LIBOR plus one \npercent compounded annually ”152.

Namely, case \nNo. 902/417/18 involved a contract in which the parties provided that if the buyer did not pay \nfor goods on time, then instead of the 3% per annum interest provided for by Article 625 \napplying, the buyer would be liable for interest at 40% per annum on the total value of any \ngoods that had not been paid for within 90 calendar days of the payment date, increasing to \n96% per annum after that 90 day period through until the date payment was made.  \n These interest rates clearly were excessively higher than the default statutory rate, and in \nmy view could readily be characterised as punitive (not merely compensatory). It is \nunsurprising, therefore, that the Grand Chamber concluded that the interest payable by the \nbuyer under these terms of the contract should be reduced. Another relevant consideration \nfor the court was that the buyer had voluntarily paid part of the outstanding sum before \nproceedings were commenced and then paid the remaining part during consideration of the \ncase (but before judgment).  \n The case does not, therefore, stand as authority for the general proposition that when 3% \ninterest under Article 625 is payable by a defendant in respect of a tort or unjust enrichment \nclaim, that sum is susceptible to reduction under Article 233. To hold otherwise would, in my \n154  The quotation from this Resolution at Nahnybida 3/263 contains a typographical error as it states that these \nprovisions are “ aimed at restoration of the property position of the debtor ”; this should read “ creditor ”.\nC6/1/166\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 167 - view equate “ penalties ”, which are expressly referred to in Article 233, with the 3% interest \npayable under Article 625, which is not punitive but compensatory in nature.  \n In my view, the case illustrates merely that where parties agree to impose a higher interest \nrate than the default 3% rate applying under Article 625, then Article 233 may be applied if \nthat higher rate is so excessive in relation to the creditor’s loss that it renders the payment \npunitive rather than compensatory in nature. But in my view this can never be the case when \nthe interest rate sought to be applied is the default rate of 3% that has been approved by \nUkraine’s Parliament for this purpose155.  \n I also note that in its Resolution dated 18 November 2021 in case No. 921/395/20, the \nSupreme Court found that Article 233 could not apply to interest payable under Article 536 \nof the Civil Code, which governs the calculation of interest payable when a person has had \nuse of another person’s money:  \n“the penalty must be distinguished from interest for the use of other people’s funds, which is \na payment for the use of them, and not a sanction for non-fulfilment or improper fulfilment of \nan obligation. The interest provided for in the contract is not a penalty (fine, penalties) and \nis not a measure of liability for violation of a monetary obligation, namely, interest for the use \nof a commodity loan in accordance with part five of Article 694 of the Civil Code of Ukraine \nand are charged regardless of the debtor’s fault.

These interests by their legal nature are \ndebt, and therefore reduce their amount on the basis of part one of Article 233 of the Civil \nCode of Ukraine and part three of Article 551 of the Civil Code of Ukraine is impossible ”.  \n I consider that this reasoning and conclusion is equally applicable to interest payable under \nArticle 625, which also legislatively establishes the amount of compensation due as a result \nof a creditor’s funds having been held or used by a person who did not have the right to do \nso, and which applies irrespective of the debtor’s fault156 (and thus cannot be regarded as \npunitive in nature).  \n155  My view is supported by the subsequent Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 21 June 2022, in case \nNo. 910/9905/21, in which the Supreme Court noted that the Grand Chamber’s conclusion in case No. \n902/417/18 was based on the “ obvious disproportionality ” of the interest rates that were sought to be \nimposed in that case: “ the Supreme Court allowed a corresponding reduction in the interest of the annual \nCP taking into account the specific circumstances of the case, namely, the establishment of such an \ninterest rate at the level of 40% and 96%, and its clear inconsistency with the principle of justice … ”.  \n156  See for example the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 24 July 2018, case No. 905/1722/17: “ the \nnorms of Article 625 of the Civil Code, which defines responsibility for the violation of a monetary obligation, \nregardless of the presence or absence of the debtor’s fault, are special, specific and do not provide any \ngrounds for exemption from responsibility for the impossibility of fulfilling a monetary obligation ”. \nC6/1/167\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 168 -  Even if I am wrong in my view that Article 233 should not in principle be potentially applicable \nto reduce the 3% interest payable under Article 625 in respect of a tort or unjust enrichment \nclaim, I consider Mr Nahnybida’s conclusion that “ the defence of reduction of penalty interest \nper annum is open to the Corporate Defendants should the court find the Corporate \nDefendants liable under Articles 1166 or 1212 of the Civil Code ” to be unreasonably \noptimistic. Where Article 233 applies, the court has a discretion whether to reduce the \npenalty in question, and in the present proceedings the Bank seeks under Article 625 interest \nat no more than the statutory rate of 3% and I am instructed that the Defendants have not \nsought to compensate the Bank for its loss voluntarily.  \nK. OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OFUKRAINIAN ENTITIES \n The experts’ points of agreement on this subject are set out at JR/115, 116, and 118.  \n The only point of disagreement, at JR/117, arises in relation to the question of who, within a \nbank, could be said to control any and all material decisions relating to that bank’s \nmanagement and affairs and/or the types of significant decision listed in paragraph 2 of the \nBank’s Response to the First Defendant’s Fourth Request for Information dated 30 July \n2021.  \n At Beketov 8/347-352, I expressed my view that a person (or persons acting together) could \nbe said to control all such decisions if they held or otherwise had the ability to control the \nvote of at least 60% of the Bank’s voting shares (prior to 27 March 2015) or 50% of the \nBank’s voting shares (after 27 March 2015).

This is because such persons would control the \nBank’s general meeting of shareholders. \n Mr Alyoshin has not agreed with my position, but his statement of disagreement at JR/117.2 \ndoes not clearly provide an alternative answer to the question. It reads: \n“OA disagrees: in his view, whether a particular decision can be described as “material” or \n“significant” shall be determined according to the bank’s articles. OA further opines that a \ndistinction should be drawn between the legal capacity to control decisions (e.g. by voting \nat shareholders’ meetings) and the day-to-day control of decisions in accordance with the \nbank/entity’s articles. ”\n In my view, this statement actually indicates agreement (or, at least, it does not indicate \ndisagreement) with my conclusion that a person (or persons acting together) who control a \nbank’s general meeting of shareholders could be said to control all of the types of decisions \nC6/1/168\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 169 - at issue. What Mr Alyoshin appears to be saying on top of this is that there may also be \nother persons having day-to-day control of these types of decisions within a bank who also \nshould be considered. But as the question is who has the ability to control any and all such \ndecisions within a bank, I believe my opinion as set out at Beketov 8/347-352 is correct. \nL. CURRENCY CONTROLS \n As recorded at JR/119, the defendants’ experts have not been instructed to respond to my \nevidence in Beketov 8 regarding Ukrainian currency controls. \nM. NBU REGULATION \n The experts’ points of agreement on this subject are set out at JR/120 and 122.  \n At JR/121, Mr Alyoshin says he disagrees with me as to the amount of the fine payable \nwhere a bank fails to provide information to a curator as requested, or provides inaccurate \ninformation. My evidence is that the fine varied from 0.05% to 0.1% of the registered \nauthorised capital of the bank (see Beketov 8/388 as corrected by paragraph 6(b) above). \nMr Alyoshin says he disagrees, but as he has not given any reasons or expressed a contrary \nposition (JR/121.2), I will only be in a position to consider and respond to his position once \nI have seen his supplemental report. \n JR/123 lists eleven issues that I addressed in Beketov 8 but on which Mr Alyoshin was not \nprepared to take a position for purposes of the Joint Report. He has instead indicated that \nhe will address these issues in his supplemental report, so I will only be in a position to \nconsider and respond to his views on these issues (if it turns out that they differ from mine) \nonce I have seen that report.  \nN. UKRAINIAN PROCEEDINGS \n The experts’ points of agreement on this subject are set out at JR/124. The six areas of \ndisagreement between us are set out at JR/125-130.  \n In relation to one of these areas of disagreement, at JR/127, Mr Alyoshin states only that he \nwill address the issue in his supplemental report. Again, I will only be in a position to consider \nand respond to his views on this issue once I have seen that report. \nC6/1/169\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 170 -  In relation to four of the other areas of disagreement, Mr Alyoshin states that he disagrees \nwith my view but expresses a contrary position in conclusory terms that amounts to little \nmore than a bare denial.

It fails to account for my main point at Beketov 8/478 that \nthe referenced version of the Law on Public Procurement ceased to have effect on 1 \nAugust 2016, whereas the Bank’s engagement agreement with Hogan Lovells is dated \n7 August 2017; \n at JR/128.2, Mr Alyoshin asserts that the First Defendant had standing to challenge the \nagreements that were the subject of the Injunctions because he had “ protected \nlegitimate interests ”, but he makes no attempt to explain what those interests were and \ndoes not engage with my explanation at Beketov 8/484-486 as to why he had no such \ninterests; and \n at JR/129.2, Mr Alyoshin describes the first injunction proceedings (case No. \n760/27582/17, in Kyiv) as seeking to invalidate contracts and terminate the illegal \nprocessing of the First Defendant’s personal data, and the second injunction \nproceedings (case No. 520/97/18, in Odessa) as seeking to protect the First \nDefendant’s honour, dignity and business reputation. On this basis, he asserts that the \nFirst Defendant did not mislead the Odessa court when stating: “ Claimant confirms that \nhe has not filed any other claim(s) against the Respondents on the same subject matter \nand the same grounds which exist in this case ”. Mr Alyoshin does not engage at all, \nhowever, with the fact that but for a discrete defamation claim against ARS TV that was \nincluded in the second claim in Odessa, the claims, defendants and reliefs sought in \nboth proceedings were otherwise substantively identical. For my part, I cannot see how \nC6/1/170\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 171 - Mr Alyoshin can reasonably conclude that the Odessa court was not misled. Framing \nthe issue in another way: the Bank in these proceedings has brought claims in tort and \nunjust enrichment, and if it were to bring the same claims against the same defendants \nin a different court, but were also to plead a defamation claim against a new defendant, \nI consider it plain that the Bank would seriously mislead that other court if it failed to \ndisclose the current proceedings whilst making the statement quoted above. \n Lastly, the sixth area of disagreement, at JR/130, concerns an issue on which I did not \nexpress a view in Beketov 8, namely whether the Injunctions remained in effect whilst the \nrulings discharging them were appealed. I do not consider this issue to be relevant to the \ncurrent proceedings, but I stated at JR/130.1 that the Injunctions were ineffective during the \npendency of those appeals. This statement was informed by the view that I reached when I \nconsidered the same issue for purposes of my second report in these proceedings, dated \n18 December 2017. But, having considered the issue again for purposes of this report, I now \nconsider that it is fair to describe the issue as one that is currently unsettled under Ukrainian \nlaw, and likely will remain so until the Supreme Court gives guidance on the matter. \n In particular, Article 153 of the Code of Civil Procedure expressly provides for different \nconsequences to ari"}

But, having considered the issue again for purposes of this report, I now \nconsider that it is fair to describe the issue as one that is currently unsettled under Ukrainian \nlaw, and likely will remain so until the Supreme Court gives guidance on the matter. \n In particular, Article 153 of the Code of Civil Procedure expressly provides for different \nconsequences to arise as a result of appeals being taken from (i) rulings granting security \nfor claims (i.e. interim injunctions), and (ii) rulings cancelling such security: \n“11. The ruling to secure a claim or to refuse to secure a claim may be appealed. The appeal \nof the resolution on securing the claim does not stop its execution, nor does it prevent the \nfurther consideration of the case. \n12. An appeal against a ruling on canceling security for a claim or on replacing one type of \nsecurity with another stops the execution of this ruling ”. \n In other words, the statute provides that appealing a ruling granting an interim injunction will \nnot stop execution of that ruling (i.e. the interim injunction can be enforced pending appeal), \nwhilst providing at the same time that appealing a ruling cancelling an interim injunction will \nstop execution of that ruling. It becomes important, therefore, to consider what is meant by \nthe prohibition on ‘executing’ a ruling.  \n There are conflicting authorities on this point, which have yet to be resolved by guidance \ngiven by the Supreme Court. On the one hand, the Kharkiv Court of Appeal noted in its \nC6/1/171\nNinth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 25 October 2022 \n- 172 - Resolution dated 28 May 2020 in case No. 643/733/19 that establishing that a ruling cannot \nbe “executed ” is not the same thing as saying that it has no “ legal force ”: \n“According to paragraph 12 of Article 153 of the Civil Procedure Code of Ukraine, an appeal \nagainst a decision to cancel a claim security or to replace one type of security with another \nstops the execution of this decision. The specified norm establishes a special regime under \nwhich an appeal against a decision that has entered into force, in accordance with Part 1 \nof Article 261 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, only stops the execution of this decision, without \naffecting its legal force ”. \n On the other hand, I am aware of rulings that point to the opposite conclusion, stating \nexpressly that a ruling cancelling an injunction will not enter into force if it is appealed: \n in its Ruling dated 15 October 2019 in proceeding No. 06.08/824/553/2019, the Kyiv \nCourt of Appeal indicated that a ruling cancelling an interim injunction will not enter into \nforce if it is appealed: “ According to Paragraph 5 of Article 158 of the Civil Procedure \nCode of Ukraine, a decision on cancellation of measures to support a claim (court \ndecision) can be appealed, and therefore its entry into force is directly related to the \nparties’ exercise of the right to appeal it ”; and \n in its Ruling dated 12 May 2021 in case No. 501/753/21, Illichivsk City Court of the \nOdesa region indicated that a ruling cancelling an interim injunction does not even enter \ninto force upon promulgation: “ From a systematic analysis of these procedural rules, it \nshould be concluded that the ruling on the cancellation of the measure of securing a \nclaim, in contrast to the ruling on securing a claim, does not enter into force immediately \nupon promulgation, is not subject to immediate execution, and in the event of an appeal \nagainst it, the execution of such a ruling stops … ”. \n None of the above appellate and first instance decisions are binding or regarded as sources \nof law, and as noted above, the question of whether the Injunctions remained in effect whilst \nthe rulings discharging them were appealed is currently unsettled, pending guidance from \nthe Supreme Court.  \nO.

He has provided no further \nexplanation of his position, however, which makes it difficult to rebut. \n To supplement my evidence in Beketov 8/515, I set out the wording of Article 232 below, \nwhich I believe is clearly of potential application to the posited scenario: \n“Article 232.
