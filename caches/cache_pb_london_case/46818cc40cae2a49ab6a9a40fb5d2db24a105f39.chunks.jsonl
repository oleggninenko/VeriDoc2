Introduction \n1.1 I am Philip Leslie Seymour, Com pany President, Director and Shareholder of the \nInternational Bureau of Aviation Group Limited (“IBA”). I am a certified aircraft appraiser with the International Society of Transport Aircraft Trading (“ISTAT”) and \nhold the designation of Senior Appraiser Fellow. I served as Chair of the ISTAT \nInternational Appraisers’ Programme from 2012 to 2018, having been elected by \nthe other appraisers to perform that role for two consecutive terms. My career \nstarted with airlines but I moved into the financed and leased aircraft management \nbusiness initially in 1994 and subsequently at IBA when I joined in 1997. Since then we have managed leased aircraft on behalf of several investment funds. We act as “lease servicer” (a commonly used term in the operating lease industry), which means we assume the customer facing role of lease arranger, negotiator, and coordinator of all of the tasks expected of a lessor. As part of that role we are often involved in the sale and purchase of aircraft and see actual/real transactions.   \nTherefore, when carrying out aircraft valuation and appraisal services, IBA do not \nonly rely upon investigation and information provided by third parties. \n1.2 I have been providing aircraft valuation and appraisal services for the past 28 years.   1.3 Since qualifying as an ISTAT certified appraiser in 1997, I have been appointed as \nexpert witness in court and arbitration proceedings in relation to the issues of aircraft and engine valuations, operating leases, sales and purchase agreements, aircraft manufacturing and maintenance programmes.  \n1.4 I have attached a summary of my experience in the aviation industry and curriculum \nvitae as Appendix 1 to this report.  \n1.5 I have been assisted in the compilation of data and necessary research by Jonathan \nMcDonald, one my colleagues at IBA, who is also a certified ISTAT Appraiser (in the Senior category) and who also possesses extensive experience in aviation market analysis, valuation and practical aspects of aircraft sales. His CV is at Appendix 2 to this report.  However, the opinions and conclusions in this report are my own.  \n \n \n2.

Aircraft Valuation Methodology  \n6.1 At paragraph 23 of the Razzhivina Report, Ms Razzhivina states that her \ninstructions are to use the IVS definitions. IVS is the abbreviation of the International Valuation Standards as published by the International Valuation Standards Council (“IVSC”). The IVSC provides general appraisal definitions which are applicable to all classes of assets. The main difference between the IVSC and ISTAT is that ISTAT applies the general terms used by the IVSC into aviation and aircraft specific \nterms, definitions and methodology.  Ms Razzhivina concludes that the IVS are in \nbroad alignment with those used by ISTAT and I agree with that conclusion.   Both Ms Razzhivina and I are ISTAT accredited appraisers, and in general, I agree with Ms Razzhivina in terms of the approach and methodology that she uses.  \n6.2 However, our valuations of the relevant aircraft differ, as shown in the summary \ntables set out in section 5, above. From my review of the information and data provided in Razzhivina Report, it appears that  Ms Razzhivina’s approach to obtaining and interpreting data points is in general terms aligned with  the way in which the our (IBA’s) analysts and data team conducted research of transactions \naround the time of the valuation (August 2016).  At Appendix 6A, I provide a l"}

From my review of the information and data provided in Razzhivina Report, it appears that  Ms Razzhivina’s approach to obtaining and interpreting data points is in general terms aligned with  the way in which the our (IBA’s) analysts and data team conducted research of transactions \naround the time of the valuation (August 2016).  At Appendix 6A, I provide a list of \nthe transactions for the Aircraft types in this case in the period 2015 to August 2016. Registered. However, despite this general agreement, some of the data points used by Ms Razzhivina in her report, and specifically described at at Appendix I, are in my opinion not directly useful for the purposes of valuing the Aircraft in question.  More details are provided in paragraph 6.18.1 and 6.18.2. \n6.3 I have not in this report provided the same level of detail as to the various datapoints \nused for each valuation, since the findings or our research and analysis were published as a single resultant figure in the relevant edition of our Aircraft Values \nBook. I describe this book in more detail below. \n6.4 The valuation methodology I have used in this report is the sales comparison \napproach which appears to be the same approach used by Ms Razzhivina. This is the most often used approach for used aircraft valuations, and relies upon an analysis of transaction data for comparable aircraft. Since actual transaction values are often not publicly available, asking prices are utilised for the sales comparison approach. We consider asking prices as useful data points but, as with most asset sales, the asking price may be above the finally-negotiated transaction price so they should only be considered rather than being factual evidence. \n6.5 In order to obtain a more accurate estimate of the market value of a particular \nD14/1/13\nExpert report of Ph ilip Leslie Seymour 14 Claim No: BL- 2017-000665 \n aircraft, appraisers are therefore required to have regard to a broad range of data. \nI describe below the approach we take at IBA, and upon which I have drawn in reaching the valuations set out in this report.  \n6.6 For each category of aircraft (single aisle, twin aisle, regional and freighters) we \nhold quarterly meetings amongst the analyst and data teams to discuss the \ndatapoints we have gleaned from publically available information, research and \ninterviews with industry stakeholders, and information that we see in the daily \ncourse of our business (which, as I note above, includes acting as lease servicer \nfor aircraft of these types).   \n6.7 At Appendix 4, I provide further details regarding the IBA Valuation Methodology. 6.8 The conclusions from those fora are fed into our valuation model.  Our valuation \nmodel has been used since IBA was formed in 1988. Since 2002 the output of that valuation model has been our on-line databases, initially called Jet-Data, which is now called IBA Insight iQ\n1. It is a subscription-based system which provides an \noutput for specific serial numbers of aircraft. Prior to 2002, the output of the \nvaluation model was a hard copy publication called the Aircraft Values Book (“AVB”).  This hard copy publication ran alongside the on-line system until last year. \nThe process of collating datapoints for the AVB was the same as for the IBA Insight iQ database, but the output was a hard copy matrix showing the year of build (manufacture) of the aircraft and the then current market value.  The AVB also provided a forecast of the future value using a theoretical “Base Value”.  Base Value is defined below and is the long-term economic value that assumes market equilibrium (equal demand and s upply).  In layman’s terms the Base Value is a \nproxy for a depreciation curve that assumes a 25 year life of the asset and a residual \n“part-out” value of 15% of the original price. The part-out value is the value that individu"}

The part-out value is the value that individual parts of the aircraft may be sold for after the aircraft is dismantled. \n6.9 The AVB was pr oduced twice a year: edition 1 was published in February and \nedition 2 was published in August.  Since I have been asked to state my opinion the Aircraft as at 16 August 2016, I have ut ilised the 2016 AVB, edition 2 in identifying \nthe Half-Live Market Values of the Aircraft.     \n6.10 Similarly, with respect to the engine values and adjustments for the condition of the \nhigh cost events of the engine refurbishment and replacement of life limited parts \n(LLP) I refer in this report to, and make use of, the IBA Engine Values Book ( EVB). \n                                                \n1 At the time of writing this report we had approximately 150 companies subscribing to IBA Insight iQ  \nD14/1/14\nExpert report of Ph ilip Leslie Seymour 15 Claim No: BL- 2017-000665 \n At Appendix 5 I provide an extract from the 2016 edition of the EVB of the relevant \nengines as fitted to the aircraft in this matter along with the introduction pages from that publication. The EVB is published once a year, since in general there are fewer \ntransactions of engines and we took the decision to publish it once per year rather \nthan twice. We have now ceased production of hard copy publications but the \ninformation is contained in our on-line database, IBA Insight iQ. \n6.11 The EVB was compiled in a similar way to the AVB, that is, our data team and \nresearchers apply the same process of data collation for engines as they do for the \naircraft. For the valuations set out in this report, the data from the EVB was used to adjust the Aircraft values for their condition rather than for specific engine valuations. That is, the published engine overhaul event cost and LLP data that we published has been used as the basis for the engine adjustment made to each aircraft. \n6.12 The aircraft valuations and engine adjustments used in this report are based on the \nvalues that we published in 2016. The half-life market values I provide are taken \nfrom the then current publication of AVB. Since my valuations were provi ded as at \nAugust 2016, I have not considered any datapoints or analysis after that period since I do not consider them to be directly (or indirectly) relevant upon my opinion of the values as at August 2016. I note that in the Razzhivina Report there is reference to subsequent datapoints being used to validate Ms Razzhivina’s conclusions. I have reviewed subsequent data and opinions, produced in more recent years, relating to each of the aircraft types in this case and do not see any reason to change my valuations. The use of more recent to reflect on previously \npublished data w ill be a topic for discussion at our joint meeting. m ade in her report.  \n6.13 At paragraphs 56 and 57 of the Razzhivina Report, Ms Razzhivina describes her \nmethodology of data capture. I assume that we have similar industry contacts since there are only a finite number of industry colleagues that we can approach with respect to gaining information. I also believe it is reasonable for me to state that given that my business employs more data analysts, researchers and ISTAT appraisers than Oriel, that it is fair to conclude that our half-life valuations w ill have \nbeen the product of at least as many, if not more datapoints.   \n6.14 In general, given the much larger team of data analysts, certified ISTAT appraisers \nand researchers that I employ at IBA, I am certain that these resources "}

My recollection of that period was that I employed 5 ISTAT appraisers \nD14/1/15\nExpert report of Ph ilip Leslie Seymour 16 Claim No: BL- 2017-000665 \n on the team as well as 16 other aircraft data and aviation analysts.  Those analysts \nare listed in Appendix 6, the introductory pages of the AVB. \n6.15 In terms of industry acceptance of IBA valuations, we have been accredited with \nthe Appraiser of the Year award in 2012, 2018, 2020, 2021. The award is made by the Airline Economics publication based on an industry-wide voting system. \n6.16 We are regular appraisers (at least annually) used by Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier \nand Embraer as well most of the major aviation banks and lessors. \n6.17 As part of the joint meeting between myself and Ms Razzhivina we will be able to \nreview the specific details of the various datapoints used by each of us. It is not apparent to me exactly how and why we differ to such a great extent on some of the aircraft. However, from the datapoints provided in Appendix I of Ms Razzhivina’s report I do note some broad ranges of transaction values and lease rates that are reviewed. Since the details of each of those transactions is not fully known, Ms Razzhivina applies her opinion of what may have been the condition surrounding \nthe transactions.  \n6.18 Those opinions are without knowledge of all of the factors that would be required to \nproperly assess the transaction data points. For example, where lease rates are known (because they have been published in an aviation journal) this cannot be considered as an ‘arms-length’ transaction. Without knowledge of the details of an aircraft delivery and redelivery condition, whether or not there are supplemental payments from the lessee to lessor for maintenance costs, or perhaps payments from lessor to lessee for improvements to the aircraft made by the lessee during the lease term, the lease rate alone can produce an incorrect equivalent market value. \nThe lease rate applied by a lessor will also take into account the credit rating of the \nlessee and consider the broader commercial relationship that the lessor has with the lessee. For example, the lessor may already have several aircraft (perhaps of other types) leased to the airline and take that commercial aspect into consideration by offering a ‘below market’ lease rate. Below are two specific examples of data points used by Ms Razzhivina that I believe are too remote from the specific values required and cannot be considered relevant to the valuations that we are required to provide:  \n6.18.1 Razzhivina Report Appendix I, page 130, Airbus Data Point 1 refers to an \naircraft transaction that was ten years younger than the one in this matter \nand the transaction was for 2 aircraft under an export credit guarantee.

I do not agree with this approach. \n6.19 The above are just two examples, not a complete list of all of my concerns about \nthe data points used and how they have been interpreted as being relevant to the valuation of the aircraft in this case. \n6.20 I note that Ms Razzhivina refers to her company, Oriel and their on-line valuation \nsystem called “Oriel VIP”, referred to in her CV at Appendix A to her report. I \nunderstand that Oriel would have published aircraft values in 2016 that relate to the \nsame aircraft in this case. I assume that the various data points used by Ms \nRazzhivina in her report would have been the basis of those published values, but \nI note that Ms Razzhivina has not appended an extract from the Oriel VIP product in her report or identified it as a source. \n6.21 It would seem appropriate that if Oriel published aircraft values in 2016 that both Ms \nRazzhivina and I refer to our then published values for the aircraft. \n6.22 The Veritas 2016 Valuation Reports\n3: In Part 3 and Appendix D of the Razzhivina \nReport Ms Razzhivina considers a number of historic valuations produced by Veritas.  I agree with Ms Razzhivina’s conclusion that those valuations are not reliable.  I particular I agree with Ms Razzhivina’s observations that the Veritas \nreports:   \n6.22.1 did not use calendar age of the aircraft but only used the total hours flown \nand; \n6.22.2 made use of an inappropriate valuation methodology by not valuing    \nthe entire aircraft,  but as separate  parts, and: \n6.22.3 only considered asking prices rather than transactional data \npoints.Valuation definitions. \n                                                \n2 PDP – pre delivery payment – a deposit made by a purchaser prior to the balance to be paid upon delivery of the aircraft  \n3 Document PBO110158_0001 and PBO110158_English  \nD14/1/17\nExpert report of Ph ilip Leslie Seymour 18 Claim No: BL- 2017-000665 \n 7. Valuation definitions \n7.1 I will now define the term “Market Value” as defined by Internati onal Society of \nTransport Aircraft Trading (“ISTAT”). For the purpose of my report and considering that the broader case involves the market value of several asset classes, I w ill \nrefer to “IBA Market Value”. I do not believe that there is any difference between \nthe definitions used in my report and those used by Ms Razzhivina.  Ms \nRazzhivina  and I are both accredited by ISTAT in their International Appraisers’ \nProgram and generally we both use their practices and definitions.  \n7.2 I provide some further explanation of these definitions below: 7.3 ISTAT provides an aircraft appraiser accreditation program with a handbook that \nprovides standards and guidelines for use by accredited appraisers. ISTAT is recognised by all major aircraft financiers, lessors and manufacturers as the primary appraisal accreditation organisation.  \n7.4 IBA Market Value is the Appraiser’s opinion of the most likely trading price that \nmay be generated for an aircraft under the market circumstances that are perceived \nto exist at the time in question. It assumes that an aircraft is valued for its \"highest, best use\", that the parties to the hypothetical sale transaction are willing, able, prudent and knowledgeable, and under no unusual pressure for a prompt sale, and that the transaction would be negotiated in an open and unrestricted market on an arm's-length, single-sale basis, for cash or equivalent consideration, and given an adequate amount of time for effective"}
{"start": 31500, "text": "e market circumstances that are perceived \nto exist at the time in question. It assumes that an aircraft is valued for its \"highest, best use\", that the parties to the hypothetical sale transaction are willing, able, prudent and knowledgeable, and under no unusual pressure for a prompt sale, and that the transaction would be negotiated in an open and unrestricted market on an arm's-length, single-sale basis, for cash or equivalent consideration, and given an adequate amount of time for effective exposure to prospective buyers (see Appendix 7 which is an extract from the ISTAT Appraisers Handbook that features the full definition). \n7.5 “ Half–Life ” pertains to scheduled inspections or overhauls that are repeated at \nspecified intervals of time, with half-life implying that the status is mid-way through \nsuch an interval. I use a half-life condition as the datum value for these aircraft as it is, in my opinion, the most fair, accurate, and tested methodology for valuing an aircraft before consideration for actual maintenance condition. It is industry standard amongst ISTAT appraisers to follow this approach. I explain this further in the detailed maintenance adjustments of each aircraft in the sections  below. \n7.6 I will now summarise and define Maint enance Adjustment Methodology.    \n7.7 Simply put, the aircraft value is adjusted by considering the maintenance event cost \nand the time used/remaining of that event to find a positive or negative adjustment \nfrom the half-life condition. \nD14/1/18\nExpert report of Ph ilip Leslie Seymour 19 Claim No: BL- 2017-000665 \n 7.8 The time between the major maintenance events is generally well defined by the \nmanufacturer; however the event cost can be subject to varying opinion by the appraiser based upon their experience. The event cost I have used is derived from manufacturer data but taking into account an element of experience that I and the team at IBA have accrued based on aircraft that we manage that occasionally need \nus to manage those major maintenance events if and when the aircraft is under \ncontrol of the owner (for example, a bank or lessor that repossesses an aircraft or an aircraft that is “off lease”) Since we at IBA organise and manage some of those events on behalf of the owners we get to see real invoices. We use that experience to adjust manufacturer data into more realistic costs.  \n7.9 My maintenance adjustment for each component is arrived at using the following \nmethodology that is best illustrated by way of an example.  I use the IAE V 2533 \nengine MSN 12582 as my example. This engine is fitted to one of the aircraft is this case, that is Airbus A321 MSN 2682 I first ascribe a cost of overhaul for the \nindividual component.  In this instance the event cost is US$ 2,600,000.  I then \nascribe an interval (usually measured in flight hours, flight cycles or months).  In this instance the interval I have used is 20,000 flight Hours based upon our experience of the time between overhaul for this type of engine.  From information provided elsewhere (either the Veritas 2016 Valuation Report, the AMS inspection report\n4 \nand/or my agreement with the data in the Razzhivina Report) there are 17,944 flight hours remaining to next shop visit.  My half – life datum is 10,000 flight hours.  Therefore, my 17,944 flight hours is 7,944 Hours above the half – life datum of 10,000 Hours.  This is known as the variance from half – life.  I then take this \nvariance of 7,944 and divide it by the interval of 20,000 which in proportionate terms \ngives me an adjustment percentage of 0.397 (7,944/20,000).  I then apply this variance percentage (0.397) and multiply it by the event cost of US$ 2,600,000.  This in turn gives me my maintenance adjustment of US$ 1,033,000 (0.397*2,600,000). Therefore, the amount of US$ 1,033, 000 is added to the half- \nlife value since the engine has more life available than my half-life starting point.

Note: where I refer to event cost this is the same as IBA cost in the tables for each aircraft analysis below. \n7.10 I apply the principle of methodology above to all of my maintenance adjustments. \n7.11 From my reading of the Razzhivina Report , I do not see any significant difference \nin the methodology that we use.

Assumptions \n8.1 I have used the then current published values in the AVB of the relevant aircraft to \nprovide the valuations in my report.  I have not inspected the Aircraft or their historical records and it is industry practice for an appraiser to set out the assumptions used if such information is not available.  \n8.2 I note that Ms Razzhivina provides her assumptions at paragraph 28 of her report. \nI am in broad agreement with those assumptions. In the extract of the AVB, I provide the assumptions used. At Appendix 6, I provide an overview of our broader methodology in order to provide an aircraft valuation.  \n  \nD14/1/20\nExpert report of Ph ilip Leslie Seymour 21 Claim No: BL- 2017-000665 \n 9. Individual Aircraft Valuations – The Boeing 737 Aircraft MSN 28569 \n9.1 Boeing delivered 1,113 of its 737-300 passenger aircraft between November 1984 \nand late 1999 (see Appendix 8 – Extract from IBA Aircraft Values Book 2016 Second Edition). \n9.2 The 737-300 was the second generation of Boeing 737 “Classic” aircraft, and was \nconsidered a successful aircraft for Boeing.  \n9.3 When its successor aircraft the Boeing 737-700 entered service in late 1997, the \nBoeing 737-300 would nonetheless see out another two years production alongside the model that would ultimately usurp it.  Often when an aircraft is supplanted by a newer model the market views the older type as perhaps a little out of date and often values and lease rates of the older model fall markedly.  However, in the late 1990s values and lease rates held firm for the Boeing 737-300 despite the presence of the newer Boeing 737-700 acting as a potential replacement. \n9.4 In late 2001, the market, particularly for maturing aircraft types such as the Boeing \n737-300, softened following the 9/11 terrorist attacks and reductions in traffic.  \nAvailability of used Boeing 737-300s increased markedly following the high-profile collapse of Ansett Australia in late 2001.  This, combined with the natural replacement cycle, placed downward pressure on values and lease rates of Boeing 737-300 passenger aircraft. \n9.5 There was some value and lease rate recovery for Boeing 737-300s when better \ntimes returned between 2004 and 2007; but all this quickly deteriorated again between 2008 and 2010 when the Global Financial Crisis took hold and operators accelerated the retirement of Boeing 737-300s.  In June 2008, Continental and \nUnited airlines both simultaneously announced the imminent retirement of up to 180 \nBoeing 737-300s and 737-500s.  The effect of those announcements on the two models’ values and lease rates bordered on the disastrous. Values and lease rates of Boeing 737-300s never fully recovered, despi"}

In June 2008, Continental and \nUnited airlines both simultaneously announced the imminent retirement of up to 180 \nBoeing 737-300s and 737-500s.  The effect of those announcements on the two models’ values and lease rates bordered on the disastrous. Values and lease rates of Boeing 737-300s never fully recovered, despite there being a successful P2F (Passenger to Freighter) conversion in place for the type. \n9.6 By August 2016, the number of Boeing 737-300s in passenger service was down \nto 481 units, or less than half the delivered fleet (See Appendix 9, an extract from the then current AVB).  The passenger fleet was declining rapidly at the time with \nSouthwest Airlines most of the way through its phase out plan and Lufthansa just \ntwo months away from final retirement. \n9.7 In August 2016, there were a recorded 180 Boeing 737-300 aircraft in storage (See \nD14/1/21\nExpert report of Ph ilip Leslie Seymour 22 Claim No: BL- 2017-000665 \n Appendix 10, an extract from the then current AVB).  I considered this a relatively \nhigh number of stored aircraft and when this many aircraft of any given type are recorded in storage this is a sign that operators are looking to exit strategies and that demand in the aftermarket is not sufficient to soak up such an oversupply. \n9.8 Although only 12 aircraft were publicly listed as available in the August 2016 edition \nof Airfax (see Appendix 11), it was well known that a high oversupply of the model \nexisted at the time. Airfax is an aircraft availability publication produced every month \nwith amid-month update of aircraft that have been listed by the owners as available \nfor sale or lease. It is a subscription-based publication which IBA subscribes to.  \n9.9 My colleagues at IBA were in regular contact with traders of Boeing 737-300 aircraft \nthrough the summer of 2016.  They reported, anecdotally, that for a Boeing 737-300 passenger aircraft of perceived good provenance, on the EASA\n5 registry, in a \ngood serviceable condition, with desirable winglets fitted (as was the case for MSN \n28659), the typical trading range was between US$ 2,500,000 and US$ \n2,900,000.8.12.  \n9.10 This Boeing 737-300, with MSN 28659, was delivered new to Deutsche BA in May \n1997 with registration D-ADBX.  In the ensuing years it operated with other airlines including British Airways, Go, easyjet, Thomsonfly, Dniproavia, Aerosvit Airlines, and at the time of appraisal, Ukraine International Airlines.  During August 2016 the aircraft would have carried its registration UR-GBD (source: IBA Insight iQ database).  \n9.11 According to information provided by the Insight iQ database, this Boeing 737-300, \nMSN  28659, was powered by two CFM56-3C1 engines and had a MTOW of \n135,000 LB.  The aircraft was in a passenger configuration and was fitted with \nwinglets and had its flight deck eyebrow windows deleted. I note that in the report of Ms Razzhivina the MTOW is stated as 136,500 LB and I will discuss this difference at the joint meeting. \n9.12 Using data provided in the then current version of AVB, I am of the opinion that this \nBoeing 737-300, MSN 28659, had a Half-Life Market Value, as at August 2016 of \nUS$ 2,790,000 (see Appendix 12, an extract from the then current copy of the AVB).  \n9.13 Having given my opinion of this aircraft’s half-life market value as of August 2016, I \nwill now detail the maint enance adjustments that I applied to this aircraft and the \n                                                \n5 EASA is the European Aviation Safety Agency.

As a percentage (aro und 2%) of the fleet size I \nconsider this not to have been excessive and one should remember that these \nstored aircraft were likely examples coming off lease from one operator and in the \nprocess of transition to the next lessee.  \n10.4 The advertised availability in August 2016 was just nine examples and less than  \n1% of the installed fleet (see Appendix 16, an extract from the then current AVB).  I \ndo not consider this an excess and I am confident that demand was strong for Airbus \nA321-200 aircraft in August 2016 and that trading values were correspondingly \nbuoyant.   \n10.5 My colleagues at IBA were in regular communication with the trading community \nand lessors in 2016 and those opinions were that Airbus A321-200s between the ages of 10 and 12 years were trading for between US$ 23,500,000 and US$ 28,000,000 depending on maintenance condition.  \n10.6 As part of the retrospective valuation of this aircraft I will now summarise the \noperational history of this aircraft up to the point of August 2016. \n10.7 This Airbus A321-200, MSN 2462 was delivered new to GB Airways (British Airways \nlivery) registered as G-TTID in May 2005.  It was merged into easyjet in May 2008. \n10.8 The aircraft was sold off-lease in January 2011 and placed with Windrose Airlines, \nthereafter with registration UR-WRH.  Apart from a few periods of short-leases with \nAirblue the aircraft remained with Windrose Airlines up to the point of valuation in August 2016 according to the IBA Insight iQ database. \n10.9 This Airbus A321-200, MSN  2462 , was powered by two IAE V2533-A5 engines and \nhad a MTOW of 89,000 kg.  I understand that the aircraft was in a passenger \nconfiguration.  \n10.10 Damage History:  I am aware that this aircraft was damaged in September 2010 \nunder the tenure of easyjet.  It was repaired by November 2010.  Aircraft with a damage history are often subjected to a value diminution owing to the stigma / \noperational restrictions that the damage / subsequent repair may inflict.  In this \nD14/1/24\nExpert report of Ph ilip Leslie Seymour 25 Claim No: BL- 2017-000665 \n instance I have not been made privy to any detailed report showing any limitations \nassociated with the damage history so in this instance I do not believe I can subtract any value diminution without seeing a technical report relating to the damage.  If further information is made available to me that does allow further value analysis I will consider it and (if necessary) address it my a supplemental report.  I note that \nin her report Ms Razzhivina applies a discount of 10% for this damage, which she \ndescribes as the ‘minimum discount’. However, this appears to be a nominal deduction without any particular methodology.  Subject to discussion with Ms Razzhivina at the joint meeting, I do not agree that it is appropriate to make such a reduction without knowing more details.   \n10.11 With due consideration of the factors presently affecting the market and in \naccordance with the views expressed elsewhere in this report, I am of the opinion that this Airbus A321-200, MSN 2462, had a Half-Life Market Value, as at August \n2016 of US$ 24,010,000 (See Appendix 17, an extract from the then current AVB).  \nMaintenance Adjustments  \n10.12 Having given my opinion of this aircraft’s half-life market value as of August 2016, I \nwill now detail the mainte nance adjustments that I applied to this aircraft along with \nits effects on market value.  \n \n \nIBA Cost:  IBA’s estimate as of 2016 of the cost to perform the nomenclature workscope. \nSV*  Shop Visit for IAE V2533-A5 engine:  Engine Overhaul for each engine or commonly refer"}

Individual Aircraft Valuations – Boeing 767-300ER MSN 25280   \n12.1 In August 2016 the then fleet size of Boeing 767-300ER aircraft was 514 units (see \nAppendix 19, an extract from the then current AVB). \n12.2 Production had only recently ceased in 2014, meaning the model had enjoyed \nnearly 27 years’ continual production.  In general I consider the Boeing 767-300ER a success and the type has certainly been well regarded by airlines and lessors over the years.  \n12.3 However, by August 2016 the passenger Boeing 767-300ER was perceived as a \nlittle dated and generally ripe for replacement; particularly as its successor, the Boeing 787-8 was infiltrating the market very successfully at the time.  Despite this, in 2016 we were seeing a very successful P2F programme for the Boeing 767-\n300ER passenger aircraft, and it should be remembered that Boeing itself was still \nbuilding brand new freighter 767-300F variants (and st ill is in 2022).  \n12.4 Although there were large numbers of stored Boeing 767-300ER aircraft in August \n2016 (I note that there were 85 examples stored (see Appendix 20, an extract from the then current AVB)) a considerable proportion of these would have been \nearmarked for P2F conversion so this additional source of long-term demand would have alleviated some of my concerns over the supply and demand aspect.  \n12.5 I reviewed the August 2016 edition of the Airfax availability publication and counted \n18 Boeing 767-300ER aircraft available for sale and lease (see Appendix 21, Airfax \nextract).

This would have \nimpacted the market value but not in a significant way. \n12.6 In August 2016 it was apparent from our anecdotal evidence from speaking to \ntraders and lessors that they were reporting used pricing for early 1990s delivered Boeing 767-300ER passenger aircraft at between US$ 5,500,000 and US$ \n9,000,000.  This rather wide range reflects the fact that the high cost of engines and \nLLPs maintenance, as well as airframe status, can have a significant effect on \ntrading values.  \n12.7 This Boeing 767-300ER, MSN 25280, was delivered new to United Airlines in \nSeptember 1991 with registration N645UA.

Individual Aircraft Valuations – Embraer ERJ-145LR MSN 145250  \n15.1 In August 2016 the then fleet size of Embraer ERJ-145 series aircraft was 666 units \n(see Appendix 24, an extract from the then current AVB). \n15.2 Although its overall sales count was competitive and therefore I consider the model \na sales success for Embraer, I recall a large oversupply of Embraer ERJ-145 aircraft \nin August 2016, particularly in its largest market of North America where 96 \nexamples alone were stored.  This was little helped by the situation in Europe whereby a further 44 were recorded as stored.  In total, from the data in the then current AVB, there were 155 aircraft recorded as stored which in my opinion \nrepresented a considerable excess (see Appendix 25, an extract from the then current AVB). \n15.3 The reasons for such high storage levels included some considerable restructures \nin the influential US market and the general move to higher capacity 70/75 seats aircraft which offered better seat mile cost efficiencies.  The position in Europe was \nlittle better where there was also an emerging preference for turboprop aircraft such \nas the ATR72-600 and Bombardier Q400. \n15.4 The August 2016 edition of Airfax lists 56 Embraer ERJ-145 series aircraft available \nfor sale or lease (see Appendix 26, Airfax extract).  \n15.5 Although this accounts for less than 10% of the installed fleet, in my judgement and \nexperience an oversupply of 56 aircraft represented a considerable re-marketability challenge and that as such, trading values would have been challenged.  My feedback from traders of Embraer ERJ-145LR and ERJ-145EP aircraft was that the typical used trade prices ranged between US$ 2,000,000 and US$ 3,300,000 \naround August 2016.
