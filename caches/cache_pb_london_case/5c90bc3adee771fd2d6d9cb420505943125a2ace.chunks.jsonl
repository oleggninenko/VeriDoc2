Thomas \n1.1 I am President and Partner, respectively, of IRE USA INC. and IRE UKRAINE LLC, \nwhich together operate as a full-service appraisal firm located in Kyiv, Ukraine. I have \n40 years of international valuation experience, including over 25 years of experience \nin the Ukrainian valuation industry.  \n \n1.2 I have extensive relevant analytical expertise and experience to act as an expert \nwitness on matters of real estate valuation. My experience and expertise includes: \n \n(1) analyses to determine the Highest and Best Use (“ HBU ”) of land (vacant and \nimproved) for development or redevelopment;  \n(2) valuation of real estate assets including commercial, residential and industrial \nbuildings and warehouses; and \n(3) valuation of a wide range of income-generating industrial and commercial asset \ncomplexes, production facilities and trade-related assets. \n \n1.3 Working within Ukraine for 25 years, I have evaluated income-generating assets \ninvolved in a wide range of economic sectors including agribusiness, metallurgical, \nenergy, commercial and residential real estate, international trade, hospitality, and \nvarious types of real estate development projects.  Based on my international \nappraisal experience, I was contracted by the United States Appraisal Institute (AI) to \nco-develop and teach two advanced international appraisal courses for AI Members \non: (i) Valuation in Challenging Markets, and (ii) Valuation for International Financial \nReporting Standards.   \n \n1.4 In my preparation of this expert valuation report, I have been assisted by IRE staff \nworking under my direction and control.

I refer to the Claimants and \nDefendants collectively as the “ Parties ”. \n1.7 In this report, I have been instructed to provide my expert opinion of the market value \nof the following assets referred to in Schedule 2 to the First Defendant’s Re-Re-\nAmended Defense (“ 1DRRAD ”)2: \n(1) Dnipro Training Center at Mykhailo Didevych (Pionersky) Lane 14 and 12, \nDnipro, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast (the “ Training Center ”).  The Training Center \ncomprises indoor and outdoor pitches, accommodation and related facilities (with \na focus on football), which can used by amateur, semi-professional and \nprofessional sports teams for a fee.  \n \n(2) Dnipro Stadium at 7, Khersonskaya Street, Dnipro, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast \n(the “ Stadium ”).  The Stadium is a 31,000 seater stadium used principally for \nfootball.  It was the home ground of FC Dnipro until 2018, when FC Dnipro \nentered into bankruptcy. \n \n(3) Assets located at 2, Druzhby Street, Slobozhansky Settlement, Dnipropetrovsk \nOblast (the “ Airfield ”).  Whilst I understand that these assets are referred to in \nthese proceedings as the “Airfield”, that description is a misnomer.  Specifically, \nthe assets which comprise the “Airfield” are a series of 33 buildings situated on \ntwo land plots owned by Dnipropetrovsk District State Administration (i.e. the \nregional government) which leases the ownership and property rights to those \nland plots to a third party.  The airfield on which these warehouses did not \nfunction as an operational airfield at my valuation date and had not done so for \nmore than a decade.  Accordingly, I limit my valuation to the buildings (but not the \nland which was not transferred to the Bank).  For consistency, however, I refer to \nthese buildings as the Airfield in my report.  \nTogether, I refer to these three assets as the “ Assets ”. \n1.8 I have been instructed to provide my expert opinion on the market value of the \nAssets, as at 6 June 2016, being the date they were transferred to the Bank \naccording to Annex A to the First Defendant’s RFI Response dated 30 July 2021 \n(“D1 RRFI  0721: Annex A ”). \n1.9 I understand that the valuers instructed to value certain of the other Transferred \nAssets have adopted the International Valuation Standards as the basis for their \nassessment(s).  For the sake of consistency, I have been instructed to apply the \ndefinition of market value provided in the 2013 edition of the International Valuation \n \n2 The Training Center at rows 186, 190 and 197; the Stadium at row 510; and the Airfield at rows 394 and 398. \nD18/1/11\n \n \n \nIRE USA Inc. \n  8 \n Standards (“ IVS 2013 ”) for the purposes of my assessment, which I consider to be \nthe appropriate standard to apply in any event.    \n1.10 My letter of instruction is at Appendix A2 at page 74. \n1.11 The list of documents produced as part of these proceeds which I have received from \nHogan Lovells are included in Appendix A3 at page 88. \nSources of Information \n \n1.12 In order to value the Assets, I rely upon various sources of information, which \ninclude: \n(1) Official Ukrainian Government Technical Passport data.

For the convenience of the Court, however, I summarize the \nprincipal differences below.  \n1.22 For the Stadium and Training Center, I consider that the difference between my \nvalues and those in the 2015 Training Center Report and 2016 Stadium Report is \ndue to those reports using inappropriate methodologies to determine the market \nvalue of the assets.  The 2016 Stadium Report values the Stadium by using the Cost \nApproach, which is based on the principle that the price a buyer in the market would \npay for an asset would be no more than the cost to purchase or construct an \nequivalent asset.24  This is not an appropriate methodology to use for income-\ngenerating assets (such as the Stadium) as set out in the IVS 2013 and leads to the \novervaluation. The 2015 Training Center Report uses a combination of the Cost \nApproach (in respect of the indoor football stadium, which is an incoming generating \nasset) and the Market Approach (in respect of the remaining assets that comprise the \nTraining Center, but does not identify why the comparables it uses are said to be \nappropriate comparables).  For my valuation, I use the Income Approach.   \n1.23 For the Airfield, the 2015 Airfield Report relies on different factual inputs than I do in \nmy valuation.  Whilst I agree that the assets referred to as the “Airfield” cannot \noperate as a functioning airfield, and that the Highest and Best Use of those assets is \nas warehouse storage space, the 2015 Airfield Report assumes that 4 to 5 times \nmore exterior  space can also be used as warehouse storage space and relies on \nanalogs that are not supported by any documentation.  I disagree.  This results in the \nover-valuation of the Airfield in the 2015 Airfield Report.  \nOwnership and Tenure  \n1.24 Verification of ownership, particularly at historic dates, is beyond the scope of the \nassignment. Ownership, per se, does not affect the market value of assets. It is my \nassumption that all assets as of the date of appraisal are held ‘freehold’ without \nencumbrances that would affect their utilization to generate income.   \nStructure of the Report \n1.25 The structure of the remainder of this report is as follows: \n In Part 2, I set out the methodology applied to reach the market valuation of the \nAssets; \n In Part 3, I present my valuation of the Training Center; \n In Part 4, I present my valuation of the Stadium; \n In Part 5, I present my valuation of the Airfield assets; and \n In Part 6, I set out my declaration as an expert. \n1.26 I set out supporting analyses and calculations in the appendices to this report. \n  \n \n24 Paragraph 63, page 25, IVS 2013 \nD18/1/15\n \n \n \nIRE USA Inc. \n  12 \n PART 2 - METHODOLOGY \n2.1 In this section I explain the relevant valuation concepts, classification of assets and \nvaluation standards that establish the basis of value and the valuation approach that I \nuse to estimate market value of the Assets at 6 June 2016 (the date of valuation). I \ngo on to explain in paragraph 2.7, 2.8 and 2.15 to 2.19 the justifications and basis for \nmy particular approach to valuation of the Assets, which have been conducted in \naccordance with the IVS 2013.  \nIVS Definitions  \n2.2 All definitions in my report are taken from the IVS 2013 and are individually \nreferenced by Page and Paragraph number.

{"start": 35000, "text": "S 2013.  \nIVS Definitions  \n2.2 All definitions in my report are taken from the IVS 2013 and are individually \nreferenced by Page and Paragraph number. Although IVS 2020 is the current global \nvaluation standard, as of the date of appraisal, IVS 2013 was the methodological \nstandard in force. There are no substantive changes in methodology between IVS \n2013 and IVS 2020. For the avoidance of doubt, I have applied IVS 2013 in reaching \nmy valuation of the Assets in this report. \nDefinition of Market Value \n2.3 My valuation of the Assets is based on the definition of market value  according to the \nmethodological approaches and requirements as set out in IVS 2013. According to \nIVS 2013, page 18, paragraph 29:  \nMarket value is the estimated amount for which an asset should exchange on the \ndate of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s length \ntransaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted \nknowledgeably, prudently, and without compulsion. \nDefinition of Highest and Best Use \n \n2.4 The IVS definition of market value requires that the HBU  of an asset be identified and \nfully integrated into the valuation approach if the valuation opinion is to be both \nreasonable and defensible.  \n \n2.5 According to IVS 2013, page 20, paragraph 34: \nThe market value of an asset will reflect its highest and best use. The highest and \nbest use is the use of an asset that maximizes its potential and that is possible, \nlegally permissible and financially feasible. The highest and best use may be for \ncontinuation of an asset’s existing use or for some alternative use. This is determined \nby the use that a market participant would have in mind for the asset when \nformulating the price that it would be willing to bid.  \n2.6 IVS 2013 requires that market valuation of an asset “will reflect its highest and best \nuse”. The HBU can be the “existing use”  or an “alternative use”.  The HBU is the use \nthat “maximizes its potential”  (i.e. that maximizes its market value). \n \nD18/1/16\n \n \n \nIRE USA Inc. \n  13 \n Valuation Approaches or Methodologies \n2.7  IVS 2013 sets out three principle valuation approaches: Market Approach, Income \nApproach and Cost Approach. 25 Each of these three approaches are, in principle, \napplicable for the valuation of real property.26  \n2.8  For the purposes of my valuation of the Assets, I have applied the Income Approach \nand, in the case  of the Airfield, the Market Approach. Both of these methodologies \nare described below. \n2.9  In acco rdance with IVS 2013, I have not applied the Cost Approach in reaching my \nvaluations. That approach is generally only applicable to the valuation of real \nproperty where there is either no evidence of transaction prices for similar property or \nno identifiable actual or notional income stream 27. It was used, however (in my view \nincorrectly – see Appendix 4.2, paragraphs 4.2.3 to 4.2.5 at pages 452 to 454, \nparagraphs 4.2.8 to 4.2.10 at page 455 and paragraphs 4.2.11 to 4.2.12 at page 455 \nto 456), in the 2015 Training Center Report, 2016 Stadium Report and 2016 Training \nCenter Report. \n \nDefinition of Income Approach \n2.10 According to IVS 2013, page 24, paragraphs 58-59: \nThe income approach provides an indication of value by converting future cash flows \nto a single current capital value.  \nThis approach considers the income that an asset will generate over its useful life \nand indicates value through a capitalization process. Capitalization involves the \nconversion of income into a capital sum through the application of an appropriate \ndiscount rate. The income stream may be derived under a contract or contracts, or \nbe non-contractual, eg the anticipated profit generated from either the use or holding \nof the asset.  \nDefinition of Market Approach \n2.11 The Market (comparable) Approach provides an indication of value by comparing the \nsubject asset with identical or similar assets for which price information is available. \n2.12 Accord"}

If few recent transactions \nhave occurred, it may also be appropriate to consider the prices of identical or similar \nassets that are listed or offered for sale provided the relevance of this information is \nclearly established and critically analyzed. It may be necessary to adjust the price \ninformation from other transactions to reflect any differences in the terms of the \nactual transaction and the basis of value and any assumptions to be adopted in the \n \n25 Paragraphs 56 to 63, pages 24 to 25 IVS 2013 \n26 Paragraph C12, page 65, IVS 2013 \n27 Paragraph C22, page 67, IVS 2013.   \nD18/1/17\n \n \n \nIRE USA Inc. \n  14 \n valuation being undertaken. There may also be differences in the legal, economic or \nphysical characteristics of the assets in other transactions and the asset being \nvalued.  \n \nDefinition of Costs Approach \n2.13 According to IVS 2013, page 67, paragraph C22: \n  \n This approach is generally applied to the valuation of real property interests through \nthe depreciated replacement cost method. It is normally used when there is either no \nevidence of transaction prices for similar property or no identifiable actual or notional \nincome stream that would accrue to the owner of the relevant interest. It is principally \nused for the valuation of specialized property, which is property that is rarely if ever \nsold in the market, except by way of sale of the business or entity of which it is part. \n \n2.14  For the reasons I explain at paragraph 2.9 above, paragraph 2.19 below and in \nparagraphs 4.3.14 and 4.3.17 of Appendix 4.3 at page 463, I do not make \nuse of the Costs Approach in my valuation.   \n \nInformation available to me \n \n2.15 I set out in Appendix 4.1, pages 449 to 452 the sources of information that I have \nrelied on in producing this report.  There are certain limitations to the information that \nis available to me in producing my valuations, which includes a lack of access to \nfinancial or other information beyond that reproduced and included in the 2015/2016 \nValuation Reports and the 2019 Valuation Reports.  Whilst I have conducted site \nvisits to the Assets, I did not have unfettered access to them.   \n \n2.16 I explain the limitations on the information available to me in paragraph 2.19 below \nand in Appendix 4.3 at page 460. \n \nMy Methodological Approach \n2.17  My methodological approach for each Asset is determined by the nature of that Asset \nand the information available to me.  I provide a more detailed analysis of my basis \nfor adopting the respective approach for each Asset in Appendix 4.3 at pages 461 to \n463, which I summarize below. \n \n2.18 For my market valuation of the Training Center and the Stadium, I have relied upon \nthe Income Approach. I consider this approach to be the correct methodology to \napply as both the Stadium and Training Center are income generating assets and \ntherefore the Income Approach is the most reliable method to apply to determine \nmarket value.   \n \n2.19 I have rejected the Cost Approach to value the Training Center and the Stadium \nbecause, under IVS 2013, it is not an appropriate methodology when valuing income-\ngenerating assets. I have also rejected the use of the Market Approach because \nD18/1/18\n \n \n \nIRE USA Inc. \n  15 \n assets like the Stadium and Training Center are not ubi"}

Whilst there is no requirement in IVS 2013 that more than one \nvaluation approach be applied, I have done so in respect of the Airfield as I consider \nit is of assistance to use the outcome of the two approaches as a check and balance \nto ensure the valuation is accurate.  \n-End of Methodology Section- \n  \nD18/1/19\n \n \n \nIRE USA Inc. \n  16 \n PART 3 - MARKET VALUATION OF THE TRAINING CENTER \n3.1 In this section, I set out my analysis of the Training Center. In Section A, I first \ndescribe the assets that form the Training Center, including the description, location \nand characteristics of those assets. This provides the relevant background and \ncontext to the Training Center which allows me to more accurately identify \ncomparable properties when applying the Income Approach. \n \n3.2 In Section B, I provide a Market Analysis which sets out the market sector within \nwhich the Training Center operates. I explain the economic context applicable to this \nasset and how I derive and use the data to develop the financial and operating \nparameters that are used to determine the market value of the Training Center. \n \n3.3 Finally, in Section C, I provide the results of the Market Valuation of the Training \nCenter. \nSection A: Asset Description \n3.4 In this section, I describe the assets of the Training Center that are the basis of my \nmarket valuation. I describe the location of the assets and the immediate \nneighborhood in which assets are located, as this affects market value of the assets. \nI describe the physical, functional and economic characteristics of individual assets \nand quantify and explain the key asset parameters and characteristics that most \naffect market value.    \n3.5 I have been instructed to rely on the data and information set out in the 2016 \nValuation Reports and the 2019 Valuation Reports insofar as it relates to the physical \nand technical details of the assets. I have therefore assumed that the basic physical \nand technical detail, and related descriptive information contained in the prior \nvaluation reports, and subsequently included and referenced in this valuation report, \nare accurate. Responsibility for the accuracy of data and information within these \nreports lies with the authors of the reports.  \n3.6 A best effort was made to confirm the accuracy of any data or information used in my \nreport that was taken from any prior valuation report, particularly information \ndescribing technical and physical characteristics of the Training Center assets, by \ncross-referencing the various sources listed and described in Appendix 4.1.1, at page \n449, by direct observation during a site visit where possible, and by photographic \nanalysis and examination of Google Earth images.

Accordingly, my \nvaluation is therefore based on the assets contained in the two technical passports referenced in Table 1.2 at \nAppendix 1.2.2, at pages 206 to 209 and further based on the assumption that the complex of assets was not \nsignificantly modified during the period 2010/2011 to 2016. \nD18/1/23\n \n \n \nIRE USA Inc. \n  20 \n 3.14 The Training Center technical passports also detail the key technical characteristics \nof the structural elements of the buildings and the facilities. I rely on such technical \npassports to understand the composite structures and materials of the facilities. The \nassets listed and described in this section of my report form the basis for the market \nvaluation of the Training Center as an income-generating complex of assets. \n3.15 Figure 3.4 shows the major structures of the Training Center located within each of \nthe two land plots39.   \n \nFigure 3.4 Major Component Assets within the Training Center Complex \n \n \n \n3.16 According to the technical passports, there are four outdoor standard grass training \nfields, an indoor football field with artificial grass and stands for 506 seats, 17 cottage \nresidences with 2 beds each and 115 dormitory beds. In total, there are 149 beds. In \naddition, there are two buildings identified as building \"A\" and building \" B \".  \n \n3.17 In building \"A\" there is a club office, living rooms for the coaching staff, a medical \nrehabilitation center, a conference hall, a meeting room for coaches, a room for \ntheoretical studies and a restaurant40.  \n \n3.18 Building B has a swimming pool, gym, sauna and showers. The cottage \naccommodations area has 2 streets with quality stone pavement. Cottages \naccommodate 2 players each and are described as having a spacious entrance hall, \ncozy living room and bedroom, shower, and air conditioners41. \n \n39 Google Earth image overlaid with information taken from the technical passports.  \n40 Ibid. \n41 Ibid. \nD18/1/24\n \n \n \nIRE USA Inc. \n  21 \n Section B: Market Analysis \n3.19 In this section I describe the market sector within which the Dnipro Training Center \noperates.

The Training Center offers extra amenities, including locker rooms with \nshowers, outdoor exercise and recreational areas, an indoor pool, and facilities for \nphysical therapy and classroom instruction, that are required for the operation of a \nsports tourism facility44. \nHBU of the Training Center \n3.24 The Highest and Best Use of an asset or asset complex, as defined in Paragraphs \n2.4 and 2.5, is the use that “maximizes its potential”  (i.e. that maximizes its market \nvalue). The HBU must be “legally permissible and financially feasible” and “may be \nfor continuation of an asset’s existing use or for some alternative use” .45  \n3.25 The legally permissible use of the land plots comprising the Training Center is limited \nto the description as given in the Ukrainian Government Land Cadaster. The legally-\nallowed use of land comprising the Training Center is for “building and servicing the \nobjects of physical culture and sports.

This land use definition significantly narrows the options for alternative \nuse of the land. Given the legally allowed uses of the land comprising the Training \nCenter as of June 2016, in my opinion there are no realistic alternative uses; in any \nevent, any alternative would likely not be “financially feasible” compared to current \nuse owing to the additional cost of asse t renovation, removal or reconstruction of \nexisting assets that may be incurred to meet the requirements of an alternative use.  \n3.26  The land and other asse ts comprising the Training Center operate collectively to \ngenerate income within the sports tourism market segment. In my opinion, this \ncurrent use is the Highest and Best Use.  \nMethodology \n3.27  I consider that the use of the Income Approach is the appropriate method to \ndetermine the market value of the Training Center. I provide a full critique of the \ncompeting approaches to valuing the Training Center at Appendix 4.3, at pages 461 \nto 462, including an explanation as to why the Cost Approach as used in the 2016 \nTraining Center Report is an inappropriate method to value it.  I also explain in \nAppendix 4.3, at page 462, why I considered and rejected the Cost and Market \nApproaches  for my valuation of the Training Center.  \n3.28 My valuation of the Training Center using the Income Approach is based on a measure \nof profitability defined as EBITDA: Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and \nAmortization.

EBITDA represents the basic earning potential of the complex of assets \nthat comprise the Training Center regardless of how the assets are financed, taxed or \nowned.  \n \n3.29 Valuation procedures as set out in IVS 2013 recognize that even if the Training Center \nwere owned and utilized exclusively by one entity, such as the FC Dnipro football club, \nthe Training Center assets would nonetheless “ be valued in the context of the relevant \nreal estate market in which the real estate trades46” and that revenue generated from \nasset use may be derived based on “ the anticipated profit generated from either the \nuse of or holding of the asset ”47 and that the Income Approach “ should be applied using \ninputs and assumptions that would be adopted by market participants ”48. \n \n3.30 The two most important variables to determine the market value using the Income \nApproach are (1) the price charged per person per day for the package of hospitality \nservices, including accommodation, offered by the Training Center49, and (2) the total \nnumber of visitors that, on average throughout the year, would utilize the hospitality \nservices of the Training Center. \n \n \n46 IVS 2013, Page 26, Paragraph 72  \n47 IVS 2013, Page 24, Paragraph 59 \n48 IVS 2013, Page 26, Paragraph 71 \n49 In The Appraisal of Real Estate, 14th Edition, the Appraisal Institute, page 467 states “ The valuation of fee \nsimple interests in income-producing real estate is based on the market rent the property is capable of \ngenerating”.

I have tried to obtain this \ninformation from, amongst other places, publicly available financial information and \nthe contemporaneous valuation reports.  In the absence of actual information, I have \ndetermined (1) a median price per person per day50 for the package of hospitality \nservices offered by the Training Center, and (2) a normalized annual occupancy rate \nfor the operation of the Training Center by reference to comparable properties.  \n \nComparable Pricing Analysis to determine median price per person per day under the \nIncome Approach \n \n3.32 Table 3.3 below lists 27 properties51 in 12 countries that are generally similar by \nquality of facilities to those of the Training Center and operate in regional and other \ninternational markets within the same market segment (sports/training/recreation \nactivities). This price data has been obtained from historic information on the website, \nand the prices shown are for 2016.  \n  \n \n50 The median is that value in a series of values such that half of the values lie above it and half of the values lie \nbelow it. A median value is further defined in the Appraisal of Real Estate, 14th Edition , the Appraisal Institute, \npage 281. It states that a Median Value is “ A measure of central tendency identified as the middle value in an \nordered array of numerical values, e.g., 7 is the median of (1, 4, 6, 6, 7, 9, 11, 22, 41) ”. \n51 Sources are given in Table 3.3 for each property.

The use of the various facilities is most often \nincluded in the charged price per person per day (including accommodation) and this \nunit of revenue is the basis for generating annual income.  \n \n54 The market does however differentiate by quality of facilities and services and there is always a range of \noptions and special arrangements that may apply to any individual transaction.   \n55 I use the median price, rather than the mean, because it is robust against outlying values.   \nD18/1/29\n \n \n \nIRE USA Inc. \n  26 \n 3.38 As set out in detail above, according to the technical passports, the Training Center \nhas dormitories and cottages that can accommodate 149 persons: 115 persons in \ndormitory rooms and 34 persons in the cottages that are designed for double \noccupancy. This affords flexibility in the size and composition of groups, or \nindividuals, that can reside at the Training Center and utilize its sports facilities. \n \n3.39 The occupancy rate is an important variable in determining the market value of the \nTraining Center using the Income Approach. Although the total capacity for \naccommodation at the Training Center is known and described above, I do not have \naccess to occupancy rate data specific to the Training Center and cannot therefore \ndirectly measure the occupancy rate of the Training Center as of June 2016.  Nor do \nI have market analyses and studies relating specifically to the hotel market in Dnipro. \n \n3.40 To determine the average annual occupancy rate for the Training Center, I utilize four \ndifferent types of proxy56 data on occupancy rates for the general hospitality (hotel) \nsector. These types of proxy data include: \n \n(1) global hotel occupancy rates between 2015 and 2019; \n(2) seasonality of hospitality rates as illustrated by the US hotel market in the \nperiod 2000 to 2016; \n(3) occupancy rates in 2016 in comparable cities, being Warsaw, Budapest, \nVienna and Prague; and \n(4) occupancy rates in Kyiv in 201657. \n3.41 Each of these proxy data sources is used to cross-check the other three sources to \nestablish the reliability of the occupancy level estimated for the Training Center.  \n \n3.42 First, global occupancy rates in the general hospitality (hotel) sector vary seasonally \nover the course of a year. Globally, hotel occupancy rates for the period 2015-2019 \nwere reported58 to have varied between 50% and 80% with peaks and troughs \nreflecting seasonality.  \n \n3.43 Second, the occupancy data from the US hotel market (illustrated in figure 1.4.3 of \nAppendix 1.4 at page 250) shows a "}

In particular, I note that in 2015 and 2016 occupancy rates varied from \n50% to ~78%59, which is consistent with the global trends of 50% to 80% explained in \nmy data point above. I conclude that seasonal occupancy affects the global \nhospitality sector and, as a consequence, it is important to take data sources across \n \n56 Proxy data (or a proxy variable) is a known or observable variable that can be used in place of a variable that \nis not known or observable (for example, the occupancy rate of the Training Center) and that has a close \ncorrelation to the unknown or unobservable variable.  \n57 There is no evidence to suggest that the occupancy rates and trends in Dnipro would have been significantly \ndifferent from that of Kyiv at this time.  \n58 https://mehotel.netlify.app/hotel-occupancy-rates-distribution.html \n59 https://calculatedriskblog.com/  \nD18/1/30\n \n \n \nIRE USA Inc. \n  27 \n a whole year (or number of years) in order to account for seasonal fluctuations in \nderiving an annual average occupancy rate.   \n \n3.44 Third, I consider occupancy rates for hotels in the cities of Warsaw and Budapest \nwhich averaged 70% during the first half of 2016 and Vienna and Prague which had \noccupancy rates averaging 69% and 66%, respectively60. These occupancy rates are \nalso consistent with the other two data sets.  \n \n3.45 Fourth, I consider the occupancy data for Kyiv for all of 2016. In undertaking this \nreview I considered two sources:  \n \n(1) a report by CBRE61 which estimated occupancy rates for Kyiv in the first \nhalf of 2016 to be around 42%; and \n \n(2) a report prepared by the firm Commercial Property which reported \noccupancy rates in Kyiv for the full year 2016 to be around 65%.62 \n \n3.46 Taking into consideration all four of the data sets described above, I have estimated \na normalized occupancy rate of 65%  for use in determining the income-generating \npotential of the Training Center. This normalized occupancy rate is entirely consistent \nwith all four sets of data herein described.  \n \n3.47  Based on the market analysis presented in this section of my report, I conclude that: \n \n the Training Center operates within the sports tourism subsector of the general \nhospitality industry;  \n the assets, operating collectively, provide a composition of asset types (such as \nplaying fields and accommodation) that are of sufficient scale and quality to meet the \nrequirements of a sports, training and recreation facility; \n the HBU of the Training Center is as a sport tourism facility; \n the base price parameter per person per (including accommodation) is 1,060 UAH; \nand \n the normalized average occupancy rate is 65%. \nSection C: My Valuation \n3.48 In this section, I explain the calculations and parameters that I use to determine market \nvalue of the Training Center based on its HBU as a sports tourism facility within the \nhospitality industry.  \n \n60 https://cbre-expandia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/CBRE_Kyiv-Hotel-Market-\nViewPoint_H12017_ENG.pdf , Page 8 \n61 Ibid. \n62https://commercialproperty.ua/analitics/obzor-gostinichnaya-nedvizhimost-kieva/  \n \nD18/1/31\n \n \n \nIRE USA Inc. \n  28 \n 3.49 In determining the market value of the Training Center, I have used the two key parameters \nof pricing and occupancy, as derived and explained above, to determine my valuation. \n3.50 I conclude that the Training Center (1) operates within the sports tourism subsector of \nthe general hos"}

I therefore base my calculation of \nOperating Expenses by analysis of EBITDA profit margins for companies operating in \ncomparable emerging markets that have been reported by Professor Aswath \nDamodaran (Professor of Finance at the Stern Business School at New York \nUniversity, and a leading figure in the field of valuation)64. \n3.55 To determine the appropriate operating expenditure, I have relied on two relevant \ncategories of data from Professor Damodaran’s archive65:  \n(1) ‘real estate service and operations’, for which Professor Damodaran concludes on \nan EBITDA profit margin of 44% from a sample of 274 companies; and  \n(2) ‘hotels/gaming’ hospitality sector for which Professor Damodaran concludes on an \nEBITDA profit margin of 39% from a sample of 407 companies. \n3.56 I consider these categories to be relevant to my valuation of the operation of a sports \ntraining and recreational center with accommodation facilities based on real estate \nassets such as those comprising the Training Center.  \n3.57 Accordingly, I use a 42% EBITDA profit margin in my valuation which lies within the \n39% to 44% range for the two economic sectors stated above.  \n \n63 I do not include VAT in my valuations as it is external to the valuation of the Assets. \n64 http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/data.html \n65 https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/  \nD18/1/32\n \n \n \nIRE USA Inc. \n  29 \n 3.58 To calculate annual Operating Expenses, I multiply annual Net Revenue in UAH by 1 \nminus the 42% EBITDA profit margin (i.e. 58%) to arrive at Operating Expenses in \nUAH.  \nMY VALUATION CONCLUSION \n3.59 I capitalize the calculated EBITDA of 15,737,931 UAH  into a market value (a capital \nsum) by dividing it by a capitalization rate that reflects the market in which the assets \noperate.

In Section A, I first \ndescribe the assets that form the Stadium, including their description, location and \ncharacteristics. This provides the relevant background and context to enable me to \naccurately identify appropriate comparable properties for the application of the \nIncome Approach. \n4.2 I then set out in Section B a Market Analysis to place the assets in their economic \ncontext. This section sets out the market sector within which the Stadium operates \nand I explain how I derive and use data from that market sector to develop the \nfinancial and operating parameters that are used to determine the market value of \nthe Stadium. \n4.3 Finally, in Section C, I provide the results of my Market Valuation of the Stadium. \nSection A: Asset Description \n4.4 In this section, I describe the assets of the Stadium that are the basis of my market \nvaluation. I describe the location of the assets and the immediate neighborhood in \nwhich assets are located, as this affects market value of the assets. I describe the \nphysical, functional and economic characteristics of individual assets and quantify \nand explain the key asset parameters and characteristics that most affect market \nvalue. \n4.5 I have been instructed to rely on the data and information set out in the 2016 \nValuation Reports and the 2019 Valuation Reports insofar as it relates to the physical \nand technical details of the assets. I have therefore assumed that the basic physical \nand technical detail, and related descriptive information contained in the prior \nvaluation reports, and subsequently included and referenced in this valuation report, \nare accurate.

Additional factors which can influence profitability include \nthe size, age, design and construction of the stadium, as well as local socio-\neconomic factors. \n \n4.14 A study in 2012 by the Consultancy “Sport + Markt73 AG” concluded that on average \nthere are 24 matches, 2-3 concerts, 3-4 competitions in other sports and about 5 \nother events (exhibitions, conventions, etc.) held at a typical European football \nstadium per year. I consider that this is an objective and reliable means of \ndetermining the likely use statistics of the Stadium and accordingly use this basic \nutility figures for activities and sources of revenue as the basis for my market \nvaluation of the Stadium. \n \n4.15 I consider that the primary sources of potential revenue at the Dnipro Stadium are the \nsale of football tickets, rent of stadium premises, rent of parking lot spaces, \nadvertising posted within the stadium, and any additional non-football events at the \nstadium such as musical or other entertainment events.  \n \n4.16 As at 6 June 2016, FC Dnipro played their home games at the Stadium.74 FC Dnipro \nwent into bankruptcy in 2018.75  I understand that SK Dnipro-1, (which is, in effect, a \n“phoenix” club, having taken over the infrastructure of FC Dnipro), now plays at the \nStadium.  \nSection C: Market Valuation  \n \nHBU of the Stadium \n \n4.17 As with the Training Center, I note that the HBU of the Stadium must be the use that \n“maximizes its potential”  (i.e. that maximizes its market value). The HBU must be \n“legally permissible and financially feasible” and “may be for continuation of an \nasset’s existing use or for some alternative use”76.  \n4.18 The Ukrainian Government Land Cadaster77 permits the use of the land ‘for the \nreconstruction of the stadium’ whilst the land use is stated as being for ‘Lands of \nHistorical and Cultural Use’ and ‘For Housing and Public Buildings’. I note that the \nexisting use of the land and the complex of assets is as a football stadium which I \nconsider to meet the requirements of the HBU. Accordingly, in my opinion, the HBU \nof the Stadium, as of June 2016, is use as a venue for sports and entertainment, \n \n73 https://dokumen.tips/documents/international-stadia-operators-survey-2012.html   «INTERNATIONAL STADIA \nOPERATORS SURVEY 2012».

To determine my market value, I calculate each potential source of \nrevenue and aggregate these to form my final market value. I analyze each revenue \nsource in turn.  \nAssumptions \n4.20 In valuing the Stadium using the Income Approach, I have assumed that the Stadium \nwill be used by a top-flight Ukrainian football team.  In this regard, I note that after FC \nDnipro went into bankruptcy, SK Dnipro-1 used the Stadium (albeit that SK Dnipro-1 \ninitially played  in the second tier of Ukrainian football). \n4.21  As I go on to explain below, revenue from ticket sales for football matches is a key \ndriver of the Stadium’s revenue in my valuation.  I recog nize that, in reality, the way \nin which ticket revenu e is distributed between the tenant football club and the \nStadium is likely to be subject to a commercial arrangement (which is likely also to \napply to any fees paid by the tenant football club to use the Stadium, as well as the \ndistribution of other football-related revenue). \n4.22  I do not have any information as to the terms of such arrangements (whether in \nrelation to FC Dnipro or SK Dnipro-1) and have been unable to locate such \ninformation in publicly available sources.  Accordingly, I have assumed in my \nvaluation that all revenue from ticket sales is available to the Stadium78.  \nMethodology \n4.23  I consider that the use of the Income Approach is the appropriate method to \ndetermine the market value of the Stadium. I provide a full critique of the competing \napproaches to valuing the Stadium at Appendix 4.3, at pages 461 to 462 including an \nexplanation as to why the Cost Approach as used in the 2016 Stadium Report is an \ninappropriate method to value the Stadium.  I also explain in Appendix 4.3, at page \n462 why I considered and rejected the Cost and Market Approaches for my valuation \nof the Stadium.  \nRevenue from Ticket Sales \n4.24 Tickets sales are the main source of revenue at the Stadium. I do not have actual \nrevenue figures available to me.  In order to estimate the revenue from ticket sales, I \nconsider the price of tickets in each sector of the Stadium ground for each game played \nduring 2016 and multiply that figure by the estimated attendance in each sector.  \n4.25 I set out in Table 4.2 each game played in 2016, the respective match date and the \nprice per sector for each game.

FC Dnipro played its European home games in Kyiv, but played its \ndomestic home games in the Stadium. The UEFA ban negatively affected the number of games permitted to be \nplayed in the Stadium which also coincided with a lower number of spectators in attendance per game.   \nD18/1/41\n \n \n \nIRE USA Inc. \n  38 \n with an average attendance per match of 13,468 which results in a total annual \nattendance of 1,198,656 spectators.  Whilst I note that annual average attendances \ndeclined in 2015 and 2016, I take the average attendance over the period 2012 to \n2016 on the basis that the factors that affected average attendances in those years \nwould stabilize and rebound in the medium term. \n \nDistribution of ticket sales  \n4.27 I then determine the distribution of the number of spectators (ticket sales) by sector \nto determine the average revenue for ticket sales per match. Accordingly, I analyzed \nthe results of ticket sales for a random match, \"SK Dnipro-1\" vs \"Zarya\". The match \noccurred on September 26, 2021 and a total of 4,781 tickets were sold for this game. \nThe distribution of ticket sales by sector is illustrated in Figure 4.4 below82.   \n \n4.28 A total of 4,781 ticket sales represents a sufficiently large sample of ‘consumer \npreference’ statements (data points) to quantify which sectors and ticket prices in the \nDnipro Stadium are in highest demand. I believe this random game reflects a typical \ndistribution of ticket sales by sector for other games as well. \n \nFigure 4.4 Distribution of Ticket Sales by Sector  \n \n4.29 The data in Figure 4.4 shows a strong preference for seating in those sectors that are \nlocated ‘mid-field’ for optimal viewing (see Figure 4.5). Just 5 sectors, 15-19, \nrepresented 63% of total ticket sales.  Side sectors behind the goal posts or in the \ncorner sections sell poorly. Accordingly, ticket prices follow this trend. Conversely, in \nthe VIP sector, as a general rule, most available seats are sold, despite the fact that \nthe prices in this sector are the highest.

Based on information in the technical passport, the \nbuilding has four floors, a basement and rooms that can be rented for office or \nstorage use. The total area of the VIP building is 11,263.6 Sqm83, of which 1,005.7 \nSqm has rental value84. \n \n4.34 The building has two positive market factors which increase the potential income to \nbe derived from renting office or storage space: it is located in the central business \ndistrict of Dnipro, close to the city center, and has secured parking and access.   \n \n83 Items 1A-4 in the Technical Passport for the Stadium dated 20.07.2008 contained in PB0285595_00001, date \nof appraisal, November 1, 2019, date of report November, 1-19, 2019 \n84 Ibid.  \nD18/1/43\n \n \n \nIRE USA Inc. \n  40 \n 4.35 Of the 1,005.7 Sqm of space in the Stadium that is suitable for rent, 490.5 Sqm is \nsuitable for office use, and 515.2Sqm is suitable for storage. Each of these is \ndiscussed in turn.  \n \nOffice Space \n4.36 There is a total of 490.5 Sqm that can be rented as office space.  \n4.37 To arrive at my valuation of the office space, I relied on, as a base value, five \ncomparable properties on the market in Dnipro from the end of 2015 to the beginning \nof 2016 (see Appendix 2.3.1 at pages 342 to 345). I set out the key features of each \nproperty and the resulting valuation of the office space in Table 4.4 below.  \n4.38 To determine annual revenue from office rental as shown in Table 4.4 below, I take \nthe advertised rental price for each comparable asset. I then make adjustments to \neach rental price to account for (1) terms of sale, and (2) differences in location. \n \n4.39 I make adjustments following the guidelines as stated in IVS 2013:85 \n \n“A valuer should analyze and make adjustments for any material differences \nbetween the comparable (offered or actual) transactions and the subject \nasset.

That room is \nused to service VIP ticket holders with food and beverage services, personal \nfacilities, and table seating space. It is not possible to independently rent this \nspace because it serves as the collective emergency exit from the Stadium for \nthe entire VIP section and therefore must remain open whenever there is an \nevent in the stadium. It is an integral asset to the operation of the building during \nany activity of use but lacks value independent of the Stadium’s activities. \n \n(2) A space of 515.7 Sqm in the form of individual kiosks located within the stadium \nproper that provide food and beverage service to attendees during games and \nevents. The space is also integral to the operation of the Stadium but similarly \nlacks value independent of the Stadium activities.

In reaching my market valuation, I first assess the assets that comprise the \nAirfield, including the description, location and characteristics. This provides the \nrelevant background and context to the Airfield assets which allows me to more \naccurately apply the valuation methodologies used. This information is set out in \nSection A.  \n \n5.2 I then set out my Market Analysis of the Airfield assets in Section B. This section \ndescribes the market sector within which the Airfield assets operate. I explain how I \nderive and use data from that market sector to develop the financial and operating \nparameters that are used to determine market value of the Airfield, including the HBU \nfor the Airfield assets.  \n \n5.3 In the final section, Section C, I provide the results of the Market Valuation of the \nAirfield assets. \nSection A: Asset Description \n \n5.4 I primarily rely on the description of the Airfield assets contained within the technical \npassport and technical data included within the 2019 Airfield Report.114 \n5.5 A best effort was made to confirm any data or information contained within the prior \nvaluation reports, particularly that describing technical and physical characteristics of \nthe assets, by cross-referencing the various sources listed and described in \nAppendix 4.1.3, at page 451, by direct observation during a site visit, and by \nphotographic analysis.  Some data and information have been clarified or corrected \nas needed. \n5.6 As I have explained above, the Airfield is not an operating airfield.  Rather, as the \n2019 Airfield Report states, it is comprised of a complex of 33 non-residential \nbuildings and structures located at: Slobozhansky Settlement, 2 Druzhby Street115.  \n \n5.7 The 2019 Airfield Report incorrectly states that the Airfield has a total area of 4,705.5 \nSqm, which I have calculated 185 Sqm too large as a result of a simple arithmetic. \nThe correct size of the Airfield is 4,520.5 Sqm and I have used the corrected figure in \nmy valuation. \n \n \n114 According to the \"Information from the State Register of Real Property Rights and the Register of Real \nProperty Rights, the State Register of Mortgages, the Unified Register of Prohibitions on the Alienation of Real \nEstate Objects in Relation to an Real Estate Object\"; date of request formation: 05.08.2016, the total area of real \nestate is 4520.5 sq.m.

Ownership and property rights to these land plots belong to the \nDnipropetrovsk District State Administration.

The total area of these \nbuildings is 4,520.5 Sqm. As noted above, in the 2019 Airfield Report, the total area \nwas indicated as 185 Sqm too large in size. This is incorrect and results from a \nsimple arithmetic error. I have therefore used the correct figure in my valuation.  \n \n5.12 According to the 2019 Airfield Report119, the assets that comprise the Airfield were \nbuilt between 1961 and 1981 and as of the date of valuation, all the premises were \nstated to be in ‘satisfactory’ condition with one building characterized as ‘good \ncondition’. All buildings were described as having concrete foundations, brick walls, \nslate roofs and could be used as storage space for primitive goods and materials that \ndo not require special conditions for storage. I consider that the use for this type of \nbuilding was in demand in 2016 because such storage is very cheap (see photos in \nAppendix 3.2.4, at pages 418 to 424).   \nSection B: Market Analysis \n5.13 In this section I describe the market sector within which the Airfield operates.

In assessing the HBU of \nthe Airfield assets, I must first identify the usable buildings and/or space. The 33 \nindividual buildings on the Airfield comprise 4,520.5 Sqm of rentable space. \nAccording the 2019 Airfield Report , there are no other buildings with rentable space \nas part of the Airfield as of 2016120. \n \n5.15 I have not assessed the HBU of the land that comprises the Airfield because \naccording to the cadaster maps shown in Figures 5.2 and 5.3, the two land plots \ncomprising the Airfield were owned by the Dnipropetrovsk District State \nAdministration. I have limited my HBU analysis to only the buildings and structures \nlocated at the Airfield.  \n \n5.16 In light of the number, size, location and condition of the buildings on the Airfield, as \nset out in more detail in Section A above and Appendix 3.2, at pages 408 to 424, in \n \nand the Register of Real Estate Ownership Rights, the State Register of Mortgages, the Unified Register of \nProhibitions on Alienation of Real Estate Objects in Relation to Real Estate Object\"; date of request formation: \n05.08.2016.

I explain in Appendix 4.3, at pages 462 to 463 my \napproach to valuing the Airfield asse ts, and why I considered and rejected the Costs \nApproach.  \nWarehouse Storage Space: Sales Trends and Vacancy Rates  \n \n5.18  In addition to assessi ng the overall demand for warehouse storage space in Ukraine, \nI set out below the sales trends and vacancy rates for warehouse storage spac e in \nUkraine. This information allows me to accurately adjust my list of comparable asse ts \nto reflect the market within which the comparable assets and the assets at the Airfield \noperate.   \n \n5.19 In the absence of market analysis and studies relating specifically to the warehouse \nstorage market in Dnipro, I have relied upon a study121 of market activity for similar \nassets located in the metropolitan area of Kharkiv in order to determine basic sales \ntrends and typical vacancy rates in the industrial and warehouse storage market.

{"start": 122500, "text": " to the warehouse \nstorage market in Dnipro, I have relied upon a study121 of market activity for similar \nassets located in the metropolitan area of Kharkiv in order to determine basic sales \ntrends and typical vacancy rates in the industrial and warehouse storage market. The \nsource provides an overview of the industrial and storage real estate sector in \nKharkiv for the first half of 2016. In my opinion, the metropolitan area of Kharkiv has \na similar real estate market to that of Dnipro and other large metropolitan areas \nwithin Ukraine and it is therefore a reliable source of proxy data in the absence of \navailable data in relation to the Dnipro market.  \n \n5.20 The report cited above shows that market activity for warehouse real estate in \nKharkiv declined significantly during 2014 and through the first half of 2015. \nBeginning in August 2015, and continuing through November 2015, market demand \nfrom potential tenants (as well as potential buyers) for industrial and warehouse real \nestate in the Kharkiv region did, however, increase. Of particular relevance to my \nvaluation is that during the first half of 2016, demand in both the rental and the sales \nsegments significantly decreased again.  \n \n5.21 The report cited above shows that, as of June 2016, potential buyers of warehouse \nstorage facilities were mainly interested in industrial and warehouse buildings with an \narea ranging from 1,000-3,000 Sqm, in at least satisfactory physical condition, and \nlocated in a developed industrial zone with access to utilities. The Airfield assets are \nsimilar in physical condition, are located in an industrial zone, have access to utilities \nand are of suitable industrial scale.  \n \n \n121 https://proconsul.com.ua/press-center/analitika/2016.html  \n \nD18/1/57\n \n \n \nIRE USA Inc. \n  54 \n 5.22 In the rental segment, the industrial and warehouse premises in highest demand \nwere those with an area of up to 1,000 Sqm, in at least satisfactory physical \ncondition, and with access to utilities. The Airfield assets are similar in physical \ncondition, are located in an industrial zone, have access to utilities and are of suitable \nindustrial scale.   \nSection C: Market Valuation \n \n5.23 In this section, I explain the calculations and parameters that I use to determine the \nmarket value of the Airfield assets. My valuation is determined using a weighted \naverage of both the Market Approach and Income Approach and is based on the \nparameters described in the market analysis section above, namely the HBU as simply \nwarehouse storage and the level of demand for this type of storage space during 2016.  \n \n5.24 I explain for each methodological approach, the technical and financial parameters \nthat were used in the valuation and explain any assumptions or adjustments that \nwere made.  \nMarket Approach \n \n5.25 As set out in paragraph 2.7 above, the Market Approach involves the comparison of \nthe Airfield assets with identical or similar assets offered for sale as of the date of \nvaluation and to apply adjustments if required. To assess the value of the Airfield \nassets, I therefore consider offer prices for similar warehouse properties in the Dnipro \nregion to determine the market value for this type of property. \n \n5.26 To determine market value using the Market Approach, I selected five assets \ncomparable to the Airfield assets offered for sale from the end of 2015 into the 1st half \nof 2016. I consider those properties to be appropriate for a number of reasons, \nincluding that each of the five assets are located in Dnipro, are similar in physical \ncondition, are located in an industrial zone and have access to utilities.  \n \n5.27 A physical description of these assets, as advertised, is set out in Table 5.2.

Further, I \nconsider that the 10% terms of sale adjustment to be valid for this type of real estate \nin Dnipro based on my experience with valuing similar assets in that city.   \n \n5.32 I then make adjustments to each comparable to account for the difference in scale of \neach comparable relative to the Airfield Assets. I do this by first recognizing that there \nis an inverse relationship between the scale of a real estate asset in Sqm and the \nprice per Sqm for which the asset is offered or sold on the market. A study132 of the \nreal estate market in Kharkiv for 2014 quantified the relationship between asset scale \nand price per Sqm of real estate offered or sold. I rely on the inverse relationship \ncalculated therein to determine appropriate adjustments for relative size of \ncomparable assets.  \n \n5.33 Two of the comparable assets in Table 5.3 (analog 14 and 15) require no adjustment \nfor relative size as both are of a similar size range relative to the Airfield assets.

I then make adjustments to each rental price to account for (1) terms \nof sale, (2) differences in location, and (3) differences in physical condition. No \nadjustments were made for differences in scale because for simple warehouse \nstorage, it is feasible and common for the owner of the property to subdivide storage \nassets into smaller units in response to market demand. \n \n5.40 I reduce advertised rental prices for all assets by 5% to account for bargaining \ndiscount prevalent within the rental market for industrial and warehouse real estate \n \n133 750 UAH / 23Sqm = 33 UAH/Sqm (rounded).   \n134 15UAH/Sqm is for open storage space and 30 UAH/Sqm is for closed storage space.

To do this, I take the adjusted rental prices offered for each \ncomparable asset as set out in Table 5.5 and calculate a median rental value of \n19.13 UAH/Sqm/month and adjust this value to account for expected occupancy \nbased on the condition of the warehouse market. To do so, I rely on the 90% \noccupancy rate estimated for the warehouse market in Ukraine as reported by \nColliers International141 covering the period from the end of 2014 to mid-2015. I see \nno further evidence to suggest that the occupancy rate has changed significantly \nfrom mid-2015 to mid-2016. \n \n5.45 Next, I subtract from the median price a 3% management fee, which in my \nprofessional opinion is typical for this type of real estate contract. I further reduce \nEBITDA by the amount of legally required annual land payment based on the Tax \nCode of Ukraine to arrive at a final estimate of annual EBITDA.  \n \n136 Aviso-Dnipro № 49 /721/ от 22.12.2015 Real Estate> Commercial Real Estate.

As stated in IVS 2013:142  \n \nMore than one valuation approach or method may be used to arrive at an \nindication of value, especially where there are insufficient factual or \nobservable inputs for a single method to produce a reliable conclusion. Where \nmore than one approach and method is used, the resulting indications of \nvalue should be analysed and reconciled to reach a valuation conclusion. \n \n5.50 Following the IVS 2013 guidelines set out above, I have analyzed the comparable \nasset data that I have relied upon to determine market value using the Market \nApproach and the Income Approach. Based on this analysis, I have concluded that \nthe set of comparable assets used in the Income Approach, as a group , are more \n \n142 Page 33, IVS 2013 \nD18/1/65\n \n \n \nIRE USA Inc. \n  62 \n closely similar to the Airfield assets than those I have used in the Market Approach. \nBased on this analysis, it is my professional judgement that the final reconciled \nmarket valuation result should reflect a weighted average of 60% of the value \ndetermined using the Income Approach and 40% of the value determined using \nMarket Approach. \n \n5.51 IVS 2013 allows the use of a weighted average calculation to determine the final \nreconciled valuation conclusion and expressly prohibits “averaging” of valuation \nresults. The explanation is set out below143:   \n \nThe word “weighting” refers to the process of analysing and reconciling \ndiffering indications of values, typically from different methods and/or \napproaches. This process does not include the averaging of valuations, \nwhich is not acceptable. \n \n5.52 The reconciled result of my valuation is set out below: \n \n June 2016  \nMarket Approach 6,154,146 UAH Reconciliation Weight 40%  \nIncome Approach 5,411,833 UAH Reconciliation Weight 60% \n \n5.53 Reconciled Market Value of Airfield Assets: 5,708,758 UAH (without VAT) . \n  \n5.54 As a cross-check to my valuation, I understand that the Airfield was sold at auction \non 6 August 2020 for 6.2m UAH (row 40 of Schedule G to RAR), which is consistent \nwith and generally supports my conclusion on valuation.
