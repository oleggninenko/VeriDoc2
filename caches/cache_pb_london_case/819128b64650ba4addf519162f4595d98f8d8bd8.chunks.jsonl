The Bank opened its case by boldly claiming that it had been the victim of fraud on \nan epic scale, yet the evidence of its own forensic accountant is that he has found no \nindication of any misappropriation by the First or Second Defendants:  \nQ.   I am asking you, though, to give an opinion on accounting loss.  The Bank's \nmethodology does not reveal any evidence to suggest either a loss or a misappropriation, does it?  \nA.   Again, my understanding of both loss and misappropriation are matters for the \ncourt to determine what those terms mean.  \nQ.   The Bank's methodology does not reveal any evidence to suggest an accounting loss \nor a movement of funds capable of being described as \"misappropriation\", does it?  \nA.   At the risk of repeating myself, I don't think it's for me to define what a misappropriation is.  \nQ.   All right.

Dealing with the first part of the question, the Bank's methodology does not provide any evidence to suggest there has been an accounting loss?  \nA.   I think that's -- that may be right.  \nQ.   If, per chance, somebody had asked you to come in and do an investigation to see if the bank had suffered a misappropriation from those unreturned prepayments, you'd have said you could find no evidence of it, wouldn't you?  \nA.   Well, again, it would depend how \"misappropriation\" was defined.  \nQ.   If you'd been asked to investigate, you would have told the Bank, \"I can see no sign that Mr Bogolyubov or Mr Kolomoisky got any part of those unreturned prepayments\"?  \nA.   I would say that, yes.  \nMr Thompson XX {Day24/102:6} - 103:9 \n2. That is the only realistic conclusion open to the Court on the evidence and it is fatal \nto the Bank’s case.  The claim which it has spent numerous years, and no doubt great \nexpense, bringing to trial is a demonstrably false construct, reliant upon a supposed tracing ‘methodology’ which even its own accounting expert does not stand behind \nand which is  flatly  inconsistent with the reality of events  as shown by the Bank’s own \ntransactional records and its contemporaneous documents.  There was no theft of \nRelevant Drawdowns (“ RDDs ”), there were no ‘ Unreturned’ Prepayments \n(“URPPs ”), no money was extracted from the Bank  and there was no \n‘Misappropriation’. \n3. The Court need have no hesitation in dismissing the claim on this ground alone, \nthough there are numerous other intractable problems as detailed below. \nA2. OVERVIEW OF MR BOGOLYUBOV ’S CLOSING SUBMISSIONS  \n4. Mr Bogolyubov’s written closings have been prepared in accordance with the 200 -page \nlimit set by the Court. By contrast, the Bank has impermissibly and unfairly expanded its written closings by attaching c.200 pages of schedules, many of which are in \nAA4/6/5\n2 \n narrative form and make yet further submissions, contrary to the Court’s clear \ndirection that schedules should not be used for submissions {Day20/139:18} -143:2. \nIt is a matter for the Court whether it pays any regard to such schedules . Time and \nspace does not permit Mr Bogolyubov to respond to them in his written closings, but \nhe will seek to address any relevant matters orally.  \n5. The Bank has failed to establish its claim against Mr Bogolyubov, both on the facts \nand in law. \n6. First, the reality of events fatally undermines the Bank’s claim that there has been a \n‘Misappropriation’ or that it has suffered loss.  The Bank put its claim as one of “ theft” \n{Day2/81 :24} -82:12, but its own contemporaneous records demonstrate that it was \nnot intended for the RDDs  to leave the Bank  and they did not do so.  Instead, so far \nas can be shown on the data provided by the Bank, ‘funds’ merely circulated between \nthe accounts of different notional customers . In reality, this  was paperwork, \ncomprising a series of internal debits and credits in the Bank’s ledgers.  The vast \nmajority of RDDs  circled around to repay other loans . The vast majority  were then \nthemselves discharged using subsequent lending. There was no appropriation of funds  \nfrom the Bank , let alone a ‘M isappropriation’. \n7. Mo reover, t here is no evidence that the  RDDs  flowed out of the Bank to the benefit \nof Mr Bogolyubov , via D3-8 or otherwise,  and t he Bank’s attempts to demonstrate this \nfall apart when subjected to even moderate scrutiny . Its attempts to suggest the RDDs  \nbenefitted Mr Bogolyubov  other than via the URPPs  are inconsistent with its case that  \nRDDs  funded URPPs  and in any event do not hang together on the facts . Equally, it"}

Mo reover, t here is no evidence that the  RDDs  flowed out of the Bank to the benefit \nof Mr Bogolyubov , via D3-8 or otherwise,  and t he Bank’s attempts to demonstrate this \nfall apart when subjected to even moderate scrutiny . Its attempts to suggest the RDDs  \nbenefitted Mr Bogolyubov  other than via the URPPs  are inconsistent with its case that  \nRDDs  funded URPPs  and in any event do not hang together on the facts . Equally, it \nhas made no attempt to prove that the RDDs  benefitted Mr Bogolyubov via the \nURPPs , instead  suggesting tha t this can be inferred from the fact the funds went to \nD3-8. Yet, the data and evidence show that ( i) USD 2.049bn of the RDDs  did not fund \nURPPs  at all; (ii) the other USD 287m  of the RDDs  in fact looped back to the Bank \nafter the  supposedly ‘Unreturned’ PPs; and ( iii) the URPPs  themselves  were simply \ntransferred to other accounts in the Bank . These funds did not  disappear into a ‘black \nhole’ as the Bank would have the Court believe . See Section B . \n8. S econd, rather than any distinct ‘Scheme’ for the ‘Misappropriation’ of the RDDs , the \nevidence reveals a pattern of loan recycling which existed long prior to the RDDs  and \nwhich continued for some time thereafter. The Bank has consciously avoided putting \nin issue the origin of this recycling, instead pursuing an artificial and contrived claim \nAA4/6/6\n3 \n of ‘Misappropriation’ for the purpose of securing perceived jurisdictional and other \nadvantages. The evidence of what was really occurring inside the Bank is addressed in Section C  below. The burden of proof is on the Bank to establish its case in this \ncontext. \n9. Third , as shown in Section D , the Bank has failed to establish that  Mr Bogolyubov \nhad any involvement in any ‘Scheme’ . The Bank glibly opened its case by saying that \n“everything that has come out in particular in disclosure over the last year... wholly contradicts [Mr \nBogolyubov’s]  ‘I knew nothing ’ submission .”1. In fact, there is a complete  absence of evidence \nagainst Mr Bogolyubov  and the Bank’s Closing submissions conflate Mr Bogolyubov \nwith Mr Kolomoisky to such an extent that they are unreliable.2 None of the Bank’s \nwitnesses  tender ed first-hand knowledge of who was responsible for directing the \nevents comprising the ‘Scheme’ , offering instead only uninformed speculation based \non unsafe assumptions.  \n10. As to the documentary record, r ather than showing that Mr Bogolyubov had “absolute \npower”  at the B ank with “trusted lieutenants”  to do his “bidding” {Day1/9:5- 10}, the truth \nis that he is hardly mentioned in connection with the Bank ’s lending business  at all.  \nThere is not one shred of  evidence of Mr Bogolyubov  giving direct or indirect \ninstructions in relation to any of the actions said to comprise the ‘Scheme ’. Moreover , \nthe documents establish his  disengagement from the Bank ’s affairs  during the relevant \nperiod. His involvement was near -exclusively limited to formal acts he had to take on \nthe Supervisory Board or as a shareholder . Most importantly, he was not involved in \napproving lending ( “Bogolyubov has not been approving [loans]  since 2010…everything is signed \nby Dubilet ”3), responding to the results of the stress test or negotiating the \nTransformation with the NBU . Those efforts were led by others who took a much \ncloser interest in the Bank and exercised greater control over its affairs.  If there was \nany mastermind behind the supposed ‘Scheme’, it is those other individuals who are \nthe most likely candidates.  The Bank says t he only plausible candidates are “ D1-2 ”, \nhowever it has completely failed to consider the case against them separately.   \n \n1  {Day1/8:22 -25} \n2  It is often the case that when the Bank cites document references as showing evidence in relation to \n“D1-2” the documents in fact concern only  D1.

The Court can have no faith in the propositions thus \ndrawn by the Bank from the evidence.  \n3  {K6/16.1/6} \nAA4/6/7\n4 \n 11. In particular, the Bank has no answer to the Deeds of Indemnity and Waiver that exist \nin Mr Bogolyubov ’s favour , undermining any suggestion that he was in control of the \nBank’s affairs during the pivotal URPP period of the ‘Scheme’  and consistent with his \nlack of engagement in Bank business.  The Bank  appears , rightly, to have abandoned \nany positive case that these documents are in authentic. The  Deeds  answer many of the \nBank’s ‘jury points ’, such as  the suggestion that if Mr Bogolyubov were genuinely \ninnocent, he would be pursuing the “ lieutenants ” for a “ monstrous betrayal of trust ”.4 \n12. This lack of evidence appears to have driven the Bank to attempt to tar Mr Bogolyubov \nwith the same brush as Mr Kolomoisky, frequently  conflati ng and eliding  their \npositions and the evidence against them  (e.g. asserting incorrectly that companies were \njointly owned or that Mr Bogolyubov was involved in actions solely taken by Mr \nKolomoisky , such as the creation of the Lafferty Spreadsheets). It was necessary for \nMr Bogolyubov to provide extensive corrections to the Bank’s oral opening and \npresentation of its documentary case against him: {AA6/19}5 and the same complaint \ncan be made about the Bank’s Closing.  Such inaccuracies and inappropriate elisions \ncannot satisfy the evidential void against Mr Bogolyubov. Nor can any inferences of \nwrongdoing be drawn from the fact that Mr Bogolyubov was willing to transfer some \nassets to the Bank in an attempt to save it during a liquidity crisis or that he has continued to communicate with Mr Kolomoisky post- Nationalisation  or that he \ncontinued to have businesses administered by individuals involved in the ‘ Scheme ’. \nSuch matters cannot found an inference of fraud. \n13. A worked example showing the  combined effect of the above  flaws in the Bank’s \nfactual case as applied to the case of Uniks is set out in Section E .  \n14. Fourth, the Bank’s claim does not work as a matter of Ukrainian law. In particular, Mr \nBogolyubov could not have breached his fiduciary duties to the Bank given his lack of awareness of any ‘Misappropriation’ and the Bank has seemingly  abandoned any claim \nthat he is liable because of some supposed standing approval given  to D1 . Further, the \nBank has not suffered any of the loss which it claims and its action is in any event time  \nbarred , both in general and in particular  in relation to the Cypriot Borrowers and \n \n4  {Day1/9:20} -10:3 \n5  The Bank responds to these corrections at Bank Closing/Appendix B2 {AA2/16/8}. It has very little \nto say, generally either accepting the correction, avoiding the point by saying it is for submissions, or \nclaiming it did not say what it said during the trial.  \nAA4/6/8\n5 \n Prominmet ( which, as explained below , are “outliers” arising from different facts) .

To assist the Court, a Decision Tree has been prepared ( Schedule 1 ) which sets out \nthe key decisions to be taken on Mr Bogolyubov’s case.  \nA3. THE EVIDENCE AT TRIAL  \n17. The Bank’s hopeless position on the documentary evidence has been summarised above. The  witness  evidence adduced at trial - both factual and expert - served only to \nset the Bank’s case back further.  \n(1) The Bank’s  Factual  Witness es \n18. The Bank’s witnesses were in many respects unsatisfactory . They often  failed to  come \nup to proof  and deviated from their written  statements, raising questions about how  \nthese were prepared . The manner in which they gave their oral evidence  also showed \nsigns of over-preparation. Specific comments are made below.  \n19. Ms Rozhkova  was a combative witness, u nwilling to accept obvious propositions . She \navoided questions about what was in fact done by the NBU, resorting to formula ic \nresponses  about what should have been done “according to the law” . In an apparent \nattempt to be helpful to the Bank, Ms Rozhkova took wholly unreal stances  e.g. initially \ndisagree ing that the Management Board should investigate shareholder wrongdoing \nand suggesting that the NBU need not take action in the face of such allegations so \nlong as the Bank was compliant with liquidity and capital ratios . She also gave \ninconsistent and unbelievable responses to questions about why the NBU did not seek a personal guarantee from Mr Bogolyubov . She ultimately made key concessions, e.g.  \nat the very end of cross -examination (“ XX”) that the NBU was well aware that Mr \nBogolyubov was not willing to give such a guarantee.  \n20. M\nr Luchaninov  was generally a relatively straightforward witness , though heavy \nwitness preparation was apparent and he was on occasion evasive , e.g. in relation to  {AA4/7}  \nAA4/6/9\n6 \n why he had included assumptions in his witness statement about Mr Bogolyubov’s \ncontrol of the Bank despite having no personal knowledge of the same.   \n21. Ultimately, he too made key concessions, accepting that  Bank employees  who were  \nengaged in shuffling related parties were  not hiding Mr Bogolyubov’s interests in \ncompanies from the NBU. It became  clear from the evidence given in XX that his \nwitness statement had been carefully crafted to insinuate wrongdoing by Mr \nBogolyubov despite Mr Luchaninov having no actual knowledge in this regard.  \n22. Ms Lozytska  was a  difficult and evasive witness. A notable example was her evidence \non the Rokoman Spreadsheet, about which she initially refused to answer  questions, \ndespite it being copied to her at the time (although it was, surprisingly , not addressed \nin her witness statement). She too ultimately made key concessions, agreeing that the \nRokoman exercise was about credit risk ratios ( not “ hiding ” Mr Bogolyubov’s interests \nfrom the NBU). She also accepted that the carefully crafted assumptions contained in  \nher witness statement about Mr Bogolyubov’s supposed relationships with the Bank’s \nmanagement were not based on her personal knowledge.  \n23. Ms  Hryn  was generally a straightforward witness. She was  cross -examined only by Mr \nKolomoisky . It was established in XX that little weight can be given to her evidence \non the issuance of the Fraudulent New Loan Claims . It transpired  that the Bank ha d \nnot called the individuals who in fact knew what was going on, instead calling Ms Hryn who was on sick leave at the relevant time.  \n24. M\nr Oleksiy enko was a cautious and sometimes evasive witness, often giving c"}

It transpired  that the Bank ha d \nnot called the individuals who in fact knew what was going on, instead calling Ms Hryn who was on sick leave at the relevant time.  \n24. M\nr Oleksiy enko was a cautious and sometimes evasive witness, often giving cagey \nanswers but ultimately making a number of concessions. It became clear during XX that his witness statement was significantly inaccurate and full of crucial omissions  (e.g. \nsaying  (incorrectly)  he had not read the Glavcom Article and did not know of the 2014 \nUkrainian Judgments, and omitting to mention the other articles he accepted  in XX \nthat he had read). The unreliable nature of his statement raises  questions about how it \nwas drafted.  \n25. M\ns Pakhachuk  was a c ombative witness who would not accept obvious points. It \nbecame clear  during XX that her witness statement was replete with exaggeration, \nespecially as regards the alleged loyalty of Bank employees to Mr Bogolyubov and the extent to which Bank departments had been overhauled after Nationalisation.  \nAA4/6/10\n7 \n (2) Expert  Witnesses  \n26. Mr Thompson (Forensic Accountancy, Bank)  did not act  as an expert in the true sense \nof the term, but as a glorified calculator for the Bank.  He permitted himself to be \nconstrained by his instructions , limiting  himself to applying the Bank’s Methodology \nto connect RDDs  to the URPPs  and calculating loss using the sum given to him by \nthe Bank. Indeed, he  had to correct his first report in XX, saying  that it should not \nexpress an opinion (“ I consider that the Bank suffered a loss of… ”) but just a calculation \n(“That should say “I calculate”. That shouldn’t say “I consider”. It’s not an opinion. ” \n{Day24/101:2- 13}).6 His reports – which ignore all counter -indications to the Bank’s \nMethodology – are useful only as expositions of the Bank’s case. \n27. This is unfortunately apiece with Mr Thompson’s evidence  in Kazakhstan Kagazy v \nZhunus  [2017] EWHC 3374 where , as he accepted, he was criticised  {Day24/53:8- 11}. \nHe did not mention this  in his CV, which suggested he had received only praise \n{D1/3 /2}. Picken J found ( i) that  his evidence “ focused on a “little slice of payments” and \nhas not looked at the broader picture ” resulting in his approach being “ as flawed as it is \nunhelpful ” [202] {M3/2.1/67- 68} and ( ii) that the approach he had been instructed to \nadopt was “ too restrictive ”, such that Mr Thompson would have agreed with the other \nexpert but for the way he had been instructed [348] {M3/2.1/122} . Mr Thompson \nclaimed this criticism was “ a function of a matter of instruction. Again, I was not giv ing an \nopinion at all as to what the appropriate methodology was. I was merely instructed to apply what was \nindeed a narrow methodology .” {Day24/53:12} - 54:22.  \n28. Mr Thompson’s evidence was also defective in failing to make clear that he was simply applying the Bank’s Methodology, and not himself expressing any opinions. Relatedly, he failed to consider facts that might detract from the use of the Bank’s Methodology such as contemporaneous documents, as explained below. \n29. When confronted with the contemporaneous evidence  in XX , he distanced himself \nfrom the Bank’s Methodology  (“It’s the Bank’s methodology ” {Day24/95:15- 17}), \nultimately accepting  that he would himself  have concluded on investigation that there \nwas “ no sign that Mr Bogolyubov or Mr Kolomoisky got any part of [the] Unreturned Prepayments ” \n \n6  The Bank’s suggestion that the experts were not instructed to consider loss (Bank Closing/743) \n{AA2/15/378} is desperate in the face of the 1st CMC Order instructing them to do so {A6/46/4}. \nAA4/6/11\n8 \n {Day24/103:5-9} .

This punches an irreparable  hole in the Bank’s case. The Court is \ninvited to re-read Mr Thompson’s XX in full.   \n30. Mr Steadman’s  (Forensic Accountancy, D2)  evidence was clear, balanced and \nconsidered. The Bank ’s criticism  of him is misconceived. His first report was limited \nto making points in addition to those made on behalf of D1 in accordance with the 1st \nCMC O rder {A6/46/ 4} ¶16. His consideration of the tracing methodology was not \nbelated but contained in his second report, and in the joint statemen ts he expressly \nagree d with D1’s methodology as well as expressing his own view on loss7 (cf. Bank \nClosing/3,  744(2 ) {AA2/15 /8} {AA2/15/379} .  He helpfully explained in XX how \nthe different approaches used by the experts - tracing  the RDDs , analysis of the loan \nbook, and analysis of flows of money out  of the Bank  - were complementary, \npermitting the Court to assess  from different angles  whether there has been a \nmisappropriation. He also confirmed in XX that he was satisfied as to the overall \npropriety of the D1 tracing analysis {Day26/18:6} - 18:14 . \n31. The Bank levelled various minor criticisms of Mr Steadman’s reports. He fairly \naccepted during XX that there were a couple of points he should have included ( e.g., a \nreference to the auditor’s qualification to the accounts {Day26/74:24} -75:2). The \nremainder of the criticisms were misplaced , e.g. (i) that Mr Steadman did not consider \nin Steadman1 how Mr Thompson had traced the Prominmet Relevant Drawdown using Exact Matching, despite the fact that Mr Thompson’s tracing  in Thompson2 \n(30.9.22)  {D1/347/65}  post-dated  Steadman1  (16.2.22) {D3/1 } {Day26/30:13- 15} \nand ( ii) that Mr Steadman had referred to the wrong IAS standard in relation to \nimpairment where, as he clearly explained, he  had referred to this IAS standard as it \nset out the definition of “ impairment ” {Day26/75:17} - 80:17.  \n32. Mr D avidson  (Forensic Accountancy, D1)  gave sensible answers in XX on the \ndifferent approaches to tracing, use of funds and repayment. Although the Bank seeks  \nto impugn his credibility, this is ultimately inconsequential. The crucial parts of his evidence – namely how the Exact Matching and Bridging Loan Methodologies are \napplied to the Bank’s  data – are agreed between the experts.   \n \n7   Steadman2/Section 2 {D3/12/5}, JEM1/2.2, 3.2, 4.2, 5.2, 6 {D4/1/4 -9}, JEM2/2.1 -2.3 {D4/2/5 -7}, \n4, 5.1 -5.3 {D4/2/10 -14}, 6.4 {D4/2/17 -18} \nAA4/6/12\n9 \n 33. Mr Beketov ’s (Ukrainian Law, Bank)  oral evidence deviated  significantly from the \nviews expressed in his written reports. He was driven in particular to  make significant \nconcessions to his evidence on the ‘Repayment defence ’ and in relation to limitation, \ngiving rise to concerns  as to how those reports were prepared a nd Mr Beketov’s \napparent willingness to express views in writing which evidently did not reflect his true \nopinion, as well as  his willingness to re-confirm that written evidence in re -examination \ndespite having given inconsistent answers in XX . The Court should therefore \napproach Mr Beketov’s written evidence with a considerable degree of caut ion, but \ncan have more confidence that the evidence elicited in XX  represents his true opinions . \n34.

Whatever the merits \nof these points  forensically , they did not ultimately affect the substance of his oral \nevidence , which largely  remained consistent with the views set out in his written \nreports  and the Bank failed to  elicit any significant concessions on the key issues . \n35. Mr Ma rchukov  (Ukrainian Law, D2)  gave straightforward and clear evidence doing his \nbest to assist the Court.  He engaged appropriately with the questions and gave direct  \nand helpful answers. The Bank failed to elicit any meaningful concessions from  him \nand he was rightly not subjected to any criticism.  \n36. Ot her experts:  The Court also heard from Mr Nahnybida (Ukrainian Law, D3 -8), \nCypriot Law and Valuation experts. Mr Bogolyubov does not comment on these \nwitnesses as their evidence concerns aspects of the case which he does not address . \nB. TH E ‘SCHEME’ IN REALITY  – NO MI SAPPROPRIATION  OR LOSS  \n37. The Bank now portrays its case as akin to 270 instances of “ theft” of physical cash from \nits vaults  {Day2/60:21} -61:4 : \nThe harm we rely upon is deprivation of property, money. The essence of our case is \nthat there were 270 separate misappropriations of the Bank’s money in the form of the relevant drawdown. Conceptually our case is no different than if the first and second defendants had visited the Bank’s vaults 270 times and over those 270 occasions simply taken out $2 billion of the Bank’s money. That’s the starting point.  \n38. Even if that were an appropriate analytical analogy (which it is not, for the reasons \nexplained in paragraph 125 below), it is entirely at odds with the reality of events, as \nrevealed by the contemporaneous emails, Skype chats and transactional data.  Indeed, \nthe Bank has not been able to give a coherent explanation in its Closings of what it says was ‘extracted’ or ‘stolen’ and how.  \nAA4/6/13\n10 \n 39. When confronted with this reality, the Bank’s own forensic account ing expert, Mr \nThompson, agreed there was no evidence of  accounting loss or  ‘misappropriation’ :  \nQ.   All right.  Dealing with the first part of the question, the Bank's methodology \ndoes not provide any evidence to suggest there has been an accounting loss?  \nA.   I think that's -- that may be right.  \nQ.   If, per chance, somebody had asked you to come in and do an investigation to \nsee if the bank had suffered a misappropriation from those unreturned \nprepayments, you'd have said you could find no evidence of it, wouldn't you?  \nA.   Well, again, it would depend how \"misappropriation\" was defined.  \nQ.   If you'd been asked to investigate, you would have told the Bank, \"I can see no \nsign that Mr Bogolyubov or Mr Kolomoisky got any part of those unreturned prepayments\"?  \nA.   I would say that, yes.                                                  {Day24/102: 19} -103:9  \n40. The Bank  also claims this was a fraud with a clear start and end point, distinguishing  \nthe “ 2013 fraud…which culminated with the unreturned prepayments in 2014” and the \n“commencement of a cover -up” which “ followed swiftly thereafter…starting with the Ukrainian \njudgments which related to these payments ” {Day1/39:15} -40:17. This  is unsustainable . The \nRDDs  and URPPs  fell within a n existing loan recycling system  (see Section C) and \nthe evidence shows that neither RDDs  nor URPPs  were ‘misappropriated ’ from the \nBank  (Sections B 1 and B 2).   \n41.

The \nRDDs  and URPPs  fell within a n existing loan recycling system  (see Section C) and \nthe evidence shows that neither RDDs  nor URPPs  were ‘misappropriated ’ from the \nBank  (Sections B 1 and B 2).   \n41. When one looks at the wider reality, and recognises that the facts are the same before, \nduring and after the “ 2013 fraud ” – circular movements of money dressed up as lending \n– there is no basis for ascribing special treatment or significance to the transactions \nfocused on by the Bank. The Bank’s attempt to salvage this by saying that evidence of \nearlier fraudulent conduct “ would serve only to provide yet further confirmation as to the \nfraudulent nature of the Misappropriation ”: Bank Closing/290(1) {AA2/15/164}  does not \nwork, both as it is not its case that there was a wider fraud, and because the acceptance \nof the possibilit y of an earlier fraud (creating a hole in the books) shows why the Bank’s \ncase that there was a Misappropriation by “ theft” of the RDDs is wrong. The same \ngoes for the Bank’s new attempts to classify the behaviour as money laundering: Bank \nClosing/290(2) {AA2/15/164}. Money laundering is not misappropriation and the \nBank makes no claim for money laundering .   \n42. Most  of the RDDs  in the Bank’s case fit within this broader loan recycling scheme . \nHowever, there  are some outliers  - the Cypriot Borrower and Prominmet  RDDs  - that \ndo not fit within even the Bank’s conception of the ‘Scheme ’ (Section B 3).   \n43. The ostensible  repayment of the RDDs  by Intermediary Drawdowns was simply the \nnext step in the recycling scheme (Section B 4). \nAA4/6/14\n11 \n 44. The Bank is now trying  to escape  the consequences of  Mr Thompson’s evidence  by \nremoulding its case. In particular, the Bank seeks  to use  Exact Matching and even the \ndisavowed Lafferty Spreadsheets in an attempt to show that Mr Bogolyubov benefitted \nfrom the RDDs . As explained below  (Section B5) , this  is inconsistent with its case  \n(the RDDs  cannot have funded both the URPPs  and different  payments the Bank says \nbenefitted Mr Bogolyubov)  and its examples do not in fact show Mr Bogolyubov \nbenefitting from the ‘Scheme’.  In fact, in neither its pleadings nor its submissions has \nthe Bank sought to confront how, consistently with its case , it is said that Mr \nBogolyubov ‘extracted’ money from the Bank to his benefit.  \n45. T he Bank chose to frame its case around the supposedly ‘Unreturned’ PPs in order to \nestablish  English jurisdiction. Its motivations no doubt  included obtaining a WFO, \navoid ing proper scrutiny of claim by a Ukrainian court and having common (if \nimproper) Ukrainian banking practices scrutinised by a foreign court which may be \nmore likely to see them as indicative of a fraud  rather than systemic country -wide issues \nresulting from  longstanding regulatory failure s. Whatever the Bank’s motivations , it \nmade a deliberate decision to formulate the  claim in the way that it  has and it must be \nkept to the case it has crafted.  \n46. If there is no ‘extraction’, the Bank’s claim falls at the first hurdle. The existence or \notherwise of a (mis)appropriation does not simply go to the Use of Funds defence, as \nthe Bank suggests: Bank Closing/294 {AA2/15/166} .  \nB1. NO ‘MISAPPROPRIATION ’ OF THE RELEVANT DRAWDOWNS  \n(1) Overview  \n47. The question of whether there was a ‘Misappropriation’ can be looked at from three complementary angles. Together these show that there is no evidence of RDDs  being \nstolen. Rather, the evidence is consistent with loan recycling , with no net effect. \n48. First, the destination of the RDDs  can be traced,  and their use established,  using ( i) \nthe Bank’s transactional data, (ii) contemporaneous discussions showing how Bank \nemployees planned to use the money and ( iii) contemporaneous records of the Scheme \n(the Kazantsev and Gurieva Spreadsheets).

Most of the RDDs  (USD 2.049bn ) cannot \nbe traced to URPPs  at all (“Type 2”  transactions) , undermining the Bank’s case which \nis premised on the funds being misappropriated via  D3-8: {Day2/63:20- 25}. The \nbalance (USD287m)  can be traced to URPPs  (“Type 1 ” transactions); however, the \nevidence shows they did not stop there (or enter a ‘black hole’) but looped back to the \nAA4/6/15\n12 \n Bank . It is not possible to trace  using the data what happened to every  RDD. However, \nit is not legitimate to assume (as the Bank suggests) that if the use of a RDD cannot \nbe traced , it was stolen . It is for the Bank to prove what happened to the funds.  \nSchedule  3 summarises the figures for the use of the RDDs and Relevant Drawdown \nPortions (“ RDD Portions ”) both by methodology and by transaction type .  \n49. Secondly , an analysis of the Bank’s loan book shows that the RDDs  did not lead to \nany significant  increase in net lending to Relevant Customers  (466 customers of the \nBank, including Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers) .  \n50. T hirdly , an analysis of payments made by Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers \nshows no flow of funds from Relevant Loans out of the Bank’s ecosystem.  \n51. To assist the Court, a list of references has been provided in Schedule 2 indicating  \nwhere evidence on key points relevant to forensic accounting can be found in the \nappendices to the expert reports .  \n(2) Tracing the RDDs /RDD Portions : (i) transactional data  \n52. The majority of RDD funds can be traced  back to the Bank . The experts agree that it \nis possible to trace  USD1.4 47bn RDDs  to the repayment of loans using Exact \nMatching, USD190m RDDs  back to the Bank using Bridging Loan Methodology and \nthe USD118m Cypriot Borrower RDDs  back using a combination of Exact Matching \nand Bridging Loan Methodology . If RDD  Portions are the starting point, USD1. 129bn \nRDD Portions can be traced  back to the Bank using Exact Matching, USD187m using \nBridging Loan Methodology and a further USD29m using a combination: Schedule \n3. USD719m can be directly traced from RDD Portions to the repayment of Relevant \nLoans : Davidson2/3.37 {D2/11/31}. \n53. The question for the Court is  whether it is most appropriate to use either Exact \nMatching and the Bridging Loan Methodology  or the Bank’s Methodology  to follow \nfunds . As Mr Thompson said, the “ whole point of tracing is to try and find a methodology that \nis appropriate to answer the question you’re trying to answer in the circumstances of the facts ” \n{Day24/50:7- 15}. The appropriate methodology  here is one  which  best answer s (in \ncircumstances where under Ukrainian law causation is a question of fact requiring \n(though this is not sufficient : see ¶ 615) a “but for” test { C5/1/19 } ¶4) whether: {AA4/ 9} \n{AA4/ 8} \n{AA4/ 9} \nAA4/6/16\n13 \n 53.1 first, the RDDs  in fact funded8 or caused URPPs  as alleged by the Bank : “The \nMisappropriation started with the transfer of funds  from the Bank to the Borrowers \nunder the Relevant  Drawdowns, and continued so as to include the transfer of funds  from \nthe Borrowers to the Defendant Suppliers pursuant to the Unreturned Prepayments .”: 22 \nMay RRFI, ¶4 {A2/9/9} , “the purpose and effect of the Relevant Loans was to cause  \npayments…to be made by 46 of the Borrowers…to the 35 Suppliers ” {D1/1/28} , “the \nBank’s case is that D3 -D8 received US$1,911,877,385 of the Relevant Drawdowns  in the \nform of the Unreturned Prepayments ” {A2/4/23}  (emphases added) ; and \n53.2 sec"}

The Bank’s attempt to claim that whether the RDDs caused the URPPs is irrelevant \nto its claim against Mr Bogolyubov  is hopeless: Bank Closing/748(2) {AA2/15/380} . \nIts factual claim of Misappropriation is premised on the RDDs being “ extracted ” by \nway of URPPs via D3 -8: e.g.  Bank Closing/514(1), 519(1) {AA2/15/285- 287}. \n(i) Exact Matching vs t he Bank’s Methodology  \n55. The Exact Matching methodology follows what in fact  happened to the RDDs . The \nBank asks the Court to ignore this , and instead to link RDDs  to URPPs  using sham \nSupply Agreement references . For 250 RDDs , this involves linking the RDD to a \nURPP  often made many months later , ignoring how  the RDD funds were actually  \nused in the meantime. In 20 cases, the RDD directly funded the UR PP transaction, \nbut the Bank’s Methodology requires the Court to ignore what then happened to those funds, which were ‘returned’ to repay other loans . Five key reasons to prefer Exact \nMatching are set out below.  \n56. F\nirst , the Bank’s Methodology ignores how funds are actually used , as Mr Thompson \naccepted {Day23/41:2- 14} {Day23/70:23- 25} {Day23/101:8- 15}.9 By contrast, \nExact Matching looks at where the money in fact went . This is  not, as Mr Thompson \n \n8  “Funded” is used here in its true sense i.e. to mean what funds were actually used for, rather than Mr \nThompson’s version of the term: see ¶ 63 below.  \n9  The Bank’s suggestion that “ it is not the case that the Exact Matching shows what was going on in the ‘real world’ \nor is somehow more consistent with the factual matrix than the Bank’s Methodology ”: Bank Closing/759(4) \n{AA2/15/383} contradicts its own expert’s evidence.  \nAA4/6/17\n14 \n sought to downplay ( e.g. {Day24/82:22} ), merely  where the money  went  “on a funds \nflow basis ”, but precisely what the Bank’s own data shows  happened to the funds . As \nMr Thompson accepted, it shows “ where is the money going from account to account  to account ” \n{Day23/50:8- 10}. Contrary to the Bank’s claim (Bank Closing/758) {AA2/15/382} , \nit does not show “ cause and effect ”. It ignores it. The analysis  is different depending on \nwhat types of transactions are being looked at.  \nType 1 transactions  \n57. There are  20 RDDs  (amounting to USD287m, of which USD284m are RDD Portions) \nwhich directly funded  12 URPPs  (Type 1  transactions) i.e. using Exact Matching, it \ncan be seen that the funds go to the Defendant Supplier.10 However, t he Bank’s \nMethodology ignores what then happens to the funds. The reality is that the funds  do \nnot stop at the Defendant Supplier. They are not ‘Unreturned’.  \n58. A good example is Intorno, where the USD15m RDD went first to Teamtrend (the \n‘Unreturned’ PP) but then back to Ribotto which used it to repay a loan to the Bank \n{AA4/3/19}, as Mr Thompson accepted: \nQ.   Yes, so on the Bank's methodology, this is intended to be both an unreturned \nprepayment whereby Teamtrend has been enriched at the expense of the Bank and that 15 million has been misappropriated by D1 and D2?  \nA.

And that methodology -- that's what it says, but notwithstanding that we know as a \nmatter of fact that - that 15 million actually came straight back from Teamtrend to \nRibotto to the Bank to repay a relevant drawdown?  \nA.   On a funds flow methodology, that's what happened.                {Day23/73:4- 14} \n59. For 11 of these 20 RDDs  (USD186m , of which USD183m are RDD Portions) , the \nexperts have been able to trace what in fact happened to these funds using Exact \nMatching. They return to the Bank in repayment of loans.11 The Type 1 transactions \nare set out at Schedule  4, which shows where the funds have been traced on to . \nType 2 transactions  \n60. The other 250 RDDs  (amounting to USD 2.049bn , of which USD 1.628 bn are Relevant \nDrawdown Portions ) are in transaction chains  where the 42 URPPs are not in fact  \nfunded  by RDDs  (Type 2 transactions).12 The Bank’s Methodology ignores this, but \n \n10  There are also 61 FX top ups which directly fund URPPs; however, these are de minimis in nature and \nfall within transaction chains where the substantive RDDs do not in fact fund URPPs. They are \ntherefore included in Type 2.  \n11  As set out below, the Gurieva Spreadsheet shows that the other six were used to repay “ KF loans ”. \n12  This includes the 61 FX top-ups described at fn. 10 above .  {AA4/ 10} \nAA4/6/18\n15 \n Mr Thompson accepted that this is the case if you look at what actually happened  to \nthe funds.  \n61. A good example is  Tseris. The competing methodologies are depicted  at {AA6/5} . \nHere USD53m RDDs  made on 13.2.14 were in fact used to repay  Tseris loans a few \ndays later . As Mr Thompson accepted, the USD53m did not stay in Tseris’ account \nand did not in fact fund  the URPP  to Teamtrend six months  later, on 11 -12.8.14  \n{Day23/31:12} - 32:16.  \n62. The Bank tries to justify ignoring what actually happens  to the funds by using an \nanalogy of term deposits. This analogy undermines, rather than supports, its case. \nWhile the deposit of funds at the start of the term and the return of deposit at the end may be “ linked ”, showing (in a real transaction) why it is being returned, this shows \nnothing about ( i) how the original deposit was used; or ( ii) what funded the return of \nthe deposit. This is shown by Mr Thompson’s explanation: Thompson2/3.14 {D1/347/21}  (original emphasis) : \nFor example, banks offer time deposits by which a customer can deposit funds for a \ncertain period of time. After the funds have been deposited, the bank may use the “same” funds for other purposes; for example, by lending to other customers, during which t ime the original customer is unable to access them. At the end of this period, \nthe deposit is returned to the original customer (together with interest). Despite: (i) the fact that, from the bank’s perspective, the deposited funds may not “remain” in the \naccount; and (ii) the unlikelihood that the returned funds are the “same” funds as those \nwhich were deposited (in a strict, proprietary sense), the deposited funds are nonetheless \nlinked to the returned funds with a time deposit reference . \n63. The other side of the coin is that the Bank’s Methodology  also ignores what in fact \nfunded the URPPs  in the Type 2 cases . The Bank has not adduced evidence on this \nand did not instruct Mr Thompson to consider it. This is presumably why Mr \nThompson refused to express an opinion on whether RDDs  “caused ” URPPs , saying \nhe preferred to use the term “ funded ”. He could not explain in XX what ‘funded’ meant \nor where it came from {Day24/59:22- 24}, but it is clear, despite its name, that it has \nnothing to do with the act"}

He could not explain in XX what ‘funded’ meant \nor where it came from {Day24/59:22- 24}, but it is clear, despite its name, that it has \nnothing to do with the actual use or source of funds  (including , e.g., considering  \nwhether the payor had sufficient funds to make the relevant prepayment absent  the \nRDD). In his words (emphasis added)  {D1/1/23}: \nWhen discussing the Bank’s case in this report, and in accordance with financial \nterminology[13], I use the word “funded” rather than “caused” to describe the Bank’s \ncase on how the Relevant Drawdowns can be traced to the Unreturned Prepayments \n \n13  No explanation was given of what “ financial terminology ” this was supposedly in accordance with.  \nAA4/6/19\n16 \n but I am not necessarily referring to the available monies in the entity’s account \nat the time of the transaction .  \n64. As no expert was asked to consider this question, there is no full  analysis of how the \nType 2 URPPs  were funded. However, the data shows that, in  at least some cases, they  \nwere funded by overdrafts. One  example is Prado, where Prado’s  USD32m  URPP  to \nCollyer  on 26.8.14 was directly funded by a ‘Return’ of Prepayment by Collyer to Prado \nof the same day. This is shown as the last step in the Bank’s Methodology {D1/34} . \nHowever, the ‘ Return’ of Prepayment was not funded by Prado’s RDDs  over five \nmonths prior . As Mr Thompson accepted , Collyer created an intra- day overdraft on \nits account which allowed it to m ake the return of prepayment : “[t]here is an intra -day \nmovement of funds, but the [Bank’s] net position remains the same ” {Day24/75: 15-25}. The \nextract of Collyer ’s accounts showing the use of the overdraft in this way is at \n{D2/9/39}  (first two lines) , Prado’s accounts at { D1/35P/2 } (lines 42 and 48) . As Mr \nSteadman explained, at the time Collyer returned the USD32m to Prado on 26.8.14 it \ndid not have any access to the Prado RDDs  in its accounts  {Day26/89:21} - 91:4. \n65. A second example is Tseris, where the ledgers show that the ‘Return s’ of Prepayment \nfrom Teamtrend  on 11 -12.8.14 funded  the URPP  (in two tranches)  to Teamtrend in \nthe same total amount (USD53m) on the same day s {K7-D/2P/9 } ##72-77. Mr \nThompson accepted that there is “ simply an intra -day movement – the return of the prepayment \ncreates an overdraft and is sent to the supposed borrower and the borrower then sends it back as the \nprepayment to the supplier all in the course of a day ” and that “the position ends up at net zero for \nthe Bank”  {Day24/82:8} -87:13. So, the bottom two arrows on the  chart showing the \nBank’s Methodology {AA6/5}  are just funded by an intra- day movement.   \n66. Further examples of URPPs funded by overdrafts are shown in Schedule 5 .  \n67. In some cases, the URPP  is directly funded by a ‘Return’ of Prepayment from a \ndifferent supplier and this in turn is funded by in a manner which does not appear on the Bank’s diagrams. A good example is Paradiz. The Bank’s diagram is at {D1/28} . \nThe URPP  from Paradiz to Trade Point Agro was directly funded by a ‘Return’ of \nPrepayment  from Kalten Trade to Paradiz. It would be necessary to investigate \nKalten’s accounts to see how that in turn was funded.  \n \n68. Secondly , the reliance up on supply agreement references is inconsistent with the \nBank’s case that the RSAs are shams and should otherwise be ignored.  As explained \nin Section C5 , the supply agreements (and references thereto) were part of the {AA4/ 11} \nAA4/6/20\n17 \n paperwork put in place to avoid currency control regulations.14 They were intended to \nmislead.

They tell the Court nothing about how the RDDs  were used.  \n69. In XX, Mr Thompson oscillated on whether it was appropriate to ignore supply \nreferences, originally claiming he expressed no opinion  {Day24/38:13- 15}. When \nreminded of the following in his  report – “I have taken account of transaction narratives when \nundertaking similar exercises previously, and do not consider it appropriate to ignore them in the circumstances of the present case (by using a methodology which takes no account of them ” \n(Thompson 2/2.2(a), 3.12 -3.16)  {D1/347/21 -22} - he claimed  this was right as “ they \ndo create a clear pattern…in the data” {Day24/42:23} -43:3. I t then transpired that Mr \nThompson had undertaken no “ similar exercises previously ” where the transaction \nnarratives were shams (“ I don’t think I’ve ever had occasion to do that ” {Day24/43:21 -24}), \nafter which  he resorted to relying on his instructions (“ I don't know what was going on.  \nI'm approaching the exercise in a mechanical way based on my instructions ” {Day24/ 44:13- 17}) \nand expressing no opinion (“ I say again, I have not expressed an opinion in this case of whether \nor not the Bank’s methodology is superior to the defendants’ methodology ” {Day24/52:9- 11}). \nApart from raising questions about how Thompson 2 was drafted, it is clear that Mr \nThompson was  not in reality able to say  that it was appropriate to trace by reference \nto false  narratives referring to sham transactions. 15   \n70. Thirdly , the Bank’s Methodology is not a coherent tracing methodology. It  mixes and \nmatches, cherry -picking between Exact Matching and linking Supply Agreement \nreferences  depending on what suits its case . Mr Thompson’s suggestion that the Bank’s \nMethodology “ uses Supply Agreement references to link Prepayments and Returns of Prepayments \nin preference to Exact Matching .” Thompson1 {D1/1/5} is not accurate: \n70.1 In Type 2 transactions, the Bank uses different tracing analyses as between Bank and Borrower (generally Exact Matching) and Borrower and Supplier \n(generally – but not always – Supply Agreement references): see \nThompson1/3.15,  fn.37 {D1/1/36 }. The Bank does not explain why , if (on \nits methodology) a prepayment under one Supply Agreement is ‘ returned ’, the \n \n14  This fact shows the flaw in Mr Thompson’s suggestion that the fact supply agreements were referred to \nin currency conversion transactions suggests they had meaning { Day24/45:1- 10}. Currency issues were \nthe reason the supply agreements were put in place.  \n15  The fact the transactions were shams was drawn to his attention e.g. he was asked to consider what was \nsaid in Yatsenko 1 about “mock supply agreements ” but failed to do so { D1/1/138 } fn.212. See also \nThompson1/3.2(b) “ The Prepayments were made under sham Supply Agreements ” {D1/1/28} . \nAA4/6/21\n18 \n funds should be linked via Exact Matching to an outgoing prepayment under \na second Supply Agreement, rather than the tracing stopping : see e.g.  the Bank’s \nMethodology as applied to Agroprom {D1/30} .  \n70.2 Equally, it does not explain how, if it is legitimate under its methodology to \ntrace one returned prepayment via Exact Matching to a different  outgoing \nprepayment, it is not legitimate to use Exact Matching to look at what the \nsupplier actually did with those ‘ prepayment ’ funds.  Mr Thompson’s \nsuggestion that “ the Bank’s Methodology links Supply Agreement references where they \nare available and uses Exact Matching where they are not ” \n(Thompson1/3.172) {D1/1/96}  (e"}
{"start": 59500, "text": "om {D1/30} .  \n70.2 Equally, it does not explain how, if it is legitimate under its methodology to \ntrace one returned prepayment via Exact Matching to a different  outgoing \nprepayment, it is not legitimate to use Exact Matching to look at what the \nsupplier actually did with those ‘ prepayment ’ funds.  Mr Thompson’s \nsuggestion that “ the Bank’s Methodology links Supply Agreement references where they \nare available and uses Exact Matching where they are not ” \n(Thompson1/3.172) {D1/1/96}  (emphasis added) is incorrect. \n70.3 Further, as shown below ( Section B3) in relation to Prominmet and the \nCypriot Borrowers, the Bank sometimes uses Exact Matching even where Supply Agreements are  available. Mr Thompson’s confirmation that “ no Supply \nAgreement references…were ignored under the Bank’s Methodology ” \n(Thompson1/3.173 ) {D1/1/96}  is also incorrect.  \n71. This shows , as Mr Thompson almost  accepted  (“[the URPPs  were] our source to do our \nwork” {Day23/26:9- 12}, “you would have to work back from  [the URPPs ] to find your Relevant \nDrawdowns ” {Day23/28:6 -7}) that the Bank’s ‘Methodology’ starts with the URPPs , \ncombining whatever methodologies needed to link them back to the RDDs . \n72. Fourth, the results reached on the Bank’s Methodology are  inconsistent with the \ncontemporaneous evidence, as explained  below. In fact, t he contemporaneous \nevidence is consistent with the Exact Matching methodology , demonstrat ing the right \napproach is to look at where the funds in fact  go.  \n73. Finally , the use of Exact Matching is  consistent with conventional tracing, as Mr \nSteadman and Mr Davidson have explained : {Day25/46:16} - 51:21 , Steadman \n2/Section 2 {D3/12/5 -8}. Having oscillated on the matter (as explained above), Mr \nThompson refused to express an  opinion on which methodology was better: “ My \ninstructions are to produce calculations based on the Bank’s methodology of loss ”; “in respect of loss, \nwhat I’m instructed to do is, in effect, perform the calculations based on instruction ”; “I was instructed \nto perform calculations based on the Bank’s approach to loss ”; “My instructions are to produce \ncalculations based on the Bank’s methodology of loss ” {Day24/60:20} -63:25. However, h e \nultimately  distance d himself from the Bank’s Methodology: “ Q.  So if you were applying \nthe Bank's methodology -- is it the Bank's methodology or is it yours? A.  It's the Bank's \nAA4/6/22\n19 \n methodology .” {Day24/95:15- 17}. Mr Thompson’s failure  to take a n independent  \nposition was despite his acceptance  that it was within his expertise to work out whether \nor not funds have been misappropriated: {Day24/60:12- 19}, that FTI’s own online \nmaterials online profess expertise in investigating allegations of misappropriated funds, \nby asking  “Where did the money come from? ” “Where did the money go? ” {E18/317} and, most \ncrucially, his own acceptance that, if he had been asked to investigate, he would have \nconcluded that there is no evidence of misappropriation of the URPPs  \n{Day24/102:13} - 103:9 . \n(ii) Bridging Loan transactions \n74. For seven transaction chains (incorporating 14 UAH RDDs  totalling USD 190m16) all \nin Apr 14, Mr Davidson used the Bridging Loan Methodology  instead of Exact \nMatching . He explained that it appeared that the purpose of the se RDDs  was t o allow \na borrower to make a prepayment in USD before another returned USD prepayment \n(which really  funded the second prepayment)  became available. It was in effect \nbridging finance : Davidson1/5.31- 5.35 {D2/1/32 -33}, Davidson1A /5.31- 5.35 \n{D2/1.1/17 -18}. The USD118m Cypriot Borrower RDDs  (Mar 14) were also traced \nin part using the Bridging Loan Methodology: see Section B3(1) below.   \n75. The Bank appear ed to accept this rationale,17 explaining that  these Bridging Loans \n“essentially enable[] the cycling to take place within the course of a day rather than having to wait six \ndays for the hryvnia to be converted back to dolla"}
{"start": 63000, "text": "le. It was in effect \nbridging finance : Davidson1/5.31- 5.35 {D2/1/32 -33}, Davidson1A /5.31- 5.35 \n{D2/1.1/17 -18}. The USD118m Cypriot Borrower RDDs  (Mar 14) were also traced \nin part using the Bridging Loan Methodology: see Section B3(1) below.   \n75. The Bank appear ed to accept this rationale,17 explaining that  these Bridging Loans \n“essentially enable[] the cycling to take place within the course of a day rather than having to wait six \ndays for the hryvnia to be converted back to dollars ” {Day25/43:12- 16}. The need to wait for \ncurrency conversion was caused by the confluence in Apr 14 of Ukraine’s foreign currency regulations (which then  required the mandatory sale of 50% of foreign \ncurrency receipts: Beketov8/374 {C1/1/126}) and the forex crisis which  was causing \ndelays in the sale of UAH and purchase of USD: Thompson2/5.59 -5.61 {D1/3 47/53-\n54} {Day24/3:11} -4:4. In all of the Bridging Loan transaction chains, previous \nprepayments had passed the 90 -day cut -off for return s: Thompson2/5.60 \n{D1/347/54} . The following was accepted by Mr Thompson {Day24/4:5- 14}:  \nQ.   So in these examples --  and we'll look at it -- what appears to be happening and \nwhat one sees is a drawdown is made in hryvnia which is then converted into dollars \nso that you have enough dollars to allow you --  if money comes in in dollars but \nhalf of it  gets transferred into hryvnia, that immediately you've got enough dollars, \n \n16  The Bridging Loan transaction chains are set out at Davidson 1/Appendix 7 -5 {D2/8/20}. They \ncomprise RDDs by Faboris {D2/9/746}, Inkom {D2/9/754}, Investgroup {D2/9/763} , Ortika \n{D2/9/774}, Paradiz {D2/9/783} , Tekhspets {D2/9/797} and Transmoloko {D2/9/807}. \n17  It now seems to have backed away from this in its written closing: Bank Closing/822 {AA2/15/413} \nAA4/6/23\n20 \n because you used your hryvnia that came in a few days earlier, to allow you to pay \nout the dollars and then you return the hryvnia?  \nA.   Yes. \n76.  An example is Paradiz , where the Bridging Loan transaction is shown at  {D2/9/784} . \nMr Thompson accepted that the evidence suggests that the transactions depicted in \nthe Paradiz  Bridging Loan diagram  are related and that, if they are all part of one \ntransaction then the net effect on the Bank  is zero save for a minimal amount which \nfell out of the picture due to the exchange transactions {Day24/9:24} -10:12 . cf. Mr \nThompson’s diagram showing the Bank’s Methodology at { D1/28 }. The transaction \ntook place over 10 -14.4.14, with the Kazantsev Spreadsheet recording 85 days as \nelapsing  on 9.4.14 for the previous Paradiz prepayment {E7/39P/76} .  \n77. The fact that Bank employees were calling the shots in relation to the recycling scheme permitted bridging finance to be used in this way. There is no question of whether the \nBorrower had to anticipate the return of prepayment and outgoing prepayment as Mr \nThompson suggested: Thompson2/5.61 {D1/347/54} .\n \n78. The Bank appeared to attempt in XX to draw support from the Bridging Loan \nMethodology for Supply Agreement link age. However, as Mr Davidson explained, \nthere are crucial differences between the two. In particular, B ridging  Loans are  “sealed ” \ntransaction s which happen over the space of a few days  with “ no other sources, no other \ndestinations ” {Day25/53:13 } -54:1. By contrast, the  Bank’s Methodology ignores where \nfunds actually go or come from and for the most part  seeks to link transactions \nhappening over the course of a few months . The focus of Bridging is still on what in \nfact happens to the funds  {Day25/52:6- 14}. In summary, “the distinction lies in the fact \nthat the bridging loan pattern is still about connecting real money that comes out into the purpose of the transaction and then goes back out to the Bank for the purpose of the transaction .” \n{Day25/82:15- 19}.

The Bank’s attempt to support its methodology in thi s way was \ndesperate . It also  cannot get it around the contemporaneous documents.\n \n(3) Tracing the RDDs : (ii) contemporaneous discussions  \n79. The intended purpose of some RDDs  is stated in contemporaneous discussions \nbetween Bank employees. Where there is such evidence, it is consistent with the results  \nachieved by  tracing the RDD  using  Exact Matching .  \n80. The Bank made no attempt to grapple with this  contemporaneous evidence , ignoring \nthe stated intentions for how funds should be used. Mr Thompson was not instructed \nto look at this evidence  (which was not provided to him in his instructions  {D1/4/16 -\nAA4/6/24\n21 \n 17}), with his instructions asking him only about the consistency of the Gurieva and \nKazantsev Spreadsheets with the Bank’s case {D1/4/6} . The Bank belatedly conceded \nin closing that there is “no dispute that there are contemporary documents (including Skypes and \ncertain entries in the Gurieva Spreadsheet) which are consistent with the Exact Matching/Funds \nFlow analysis ”: Bank Closing/814 {AA2/15/410}  \n81. There are four types of contemporaneous discussions bearing on the intended purpose \nof RDDs .  \n82. First, for 21 RDDs  (nine Type 1 and twelve Type 218), contemporaneous Skype chats \nand emails expressly  state the intended destination of the funds . The evidence is \nsummarised  in D2 Opening/ Schedule 2 {AA4/3} . \n83. Taking  the Type 1 example of Dorteks  (D2 Opening/Schedule 2 {AA4/3 /2}), Skype \nchats of 28.8.14 (the day of the Dorteks RDDs ) show that the  Bank employees \nintended to use the Dorteks RDDs  to repay loans to Amadoras and Gardera , with the \nfunds travelling via Collyer (in USD) as part of the “ currency scheme ”. (This is also \nreflected in  the Kazantsev and Gurieva Spreadsheet s: see below) : \ndn030464tan (Taranenko, Alla) 28/08/2014 08:09:39  \n[10:37:07] Loan is for the Dorteks purchase of Dorteks 460,694,152.71 UAH \n[i.e. the total sum of the two RDDs ] for the purchase of USD 33 million \nand counter repayment of Amodaras and Gardera and loan for PF Profit \n1,574,500.00 UAH [19] \n dn030464tan (Taranenko, Alla) 28/08/2014 08:10:01  \nGubanova will con ﬁrm in a moment […] \n \ndn030464tan (Taranenko, Alla) 28/08/2014 08:39:06  \ntell Amodoras and Gardera to send payment orders for repayment of the hryvnia loans […] \n dn030464tan (Taranenko, Alla) 28/08/2014 12:01:46  \nGardera 69,454,870.00 UAH [i.e. the amount shown by Exact Matching \nas repaid on G ardera’s  loan by the Dorteks RDDs .] \n dn030464tan (Taranenko, Alla) 28/08/2014 12:02:14  \nAmodaras 388,947,272.00 UAH  [i.e. the total amount shown by Exact \nMatching  as repaid on Amadoras’ loans by the Dorteks RDDs .] \n{K6/46.2/5 -7} \n \n18  Type 1: Dorteks (x2), Empire ( x1), Uniks ( x2), Intorno ( x1), Inkom ( x1), Transmoloko ( x1), Tekhspets \n(x1). Type 2 : Tamersa (x2), Ribotto (x2), Ortika (x5), Real (x1), Solmbridge (x2).  \n19  The Profit figure is also a Relevant Drawdown.  \nAA4/6/25\n22 \n 84. Mr Thompson accepted in XX, in relation to the further e.g.s of Uniks  and Intorno \n(D2 Opening, Schedule 2 {AA4/3 } pp.17, 19) , that the Skypes show t hat the purpose \nof the RDDs  is to repay other debts,  thus showing apparent  loan recycling and \nconsistent with Exact Matching : {Day23/62:11} - 63:7 {Day23/67:1} - 69:5. \n85. Secondly , for some other RDDs , although the contemporaneous evidence does not \nexplain the purpose of those drawdowns , it explains the purpose  of other transactions \nby the same Borrower, similar to the use shown by Exact Matching .  \n86.

Secondly , for some other RDDs , although the contemporaneous evidence does not \nexplain the purpose of those drawdowns , it explains the purpose  of other transactions \nby the same Borrower, similar to the use shown by Exact Matching .  \n86. T aking the Type 2 example of Fabor is, the Bank says that the Exact Matching  analysis \n{D2/9/94}  showing the Faboris RDDs  funding loan repayments  by Frilain and \nFaboris “ disregards the payment references in the Bank’s transactional data as to what the payments \nwere for ”: Bank Opening/568- 572 {AA2/1/222- 224}. \n87. As a preliminary point, the supply contracts do not appear in references for  the RDDs  \nthemselves : see e.g. in Faboris’ accounts {D1/57 }. Moreover, although t here are no  \ndocuments in the trial bundle evidencing Bank employees discussing the purpose of  \nthe Faboris RDDs , there are  chats showing that earlier Faboris lending was  also \nintended to be recycled, in that case  to repay AEF and Frilain20 debts:  \ndn270888sav (Suprun, Alina) 24/09/2013 07:13:19  \nToday, Faboris is paying 62 million for Kalten, who will be refunded?  \n \ndd060280anv (Ageeva, Natalia) 24/09/2013 07:13:25  \nTatyana Grigorievna, tell me please, regarding Faboris and freeline – 2 is \nsupposed to come in for freeline, and Faboris will pay 62?  \n dn090158gtg (Gubanova , Tatiana) 24/09/2013 08:03:48  \nWe will confer about Faboris Freeline, is UN selling? […] \n \ndn090158gtg (Gubanova, Tatiana) 24/09/2013 08:12:13  Faboris is paying 62, 2 is being refunded to Freeline, and the balance of 60.0 is going to AEF. Please prepare the instructions. There is no sale there -- \neveryone is paying off USD loans  \n{K6/26.3/3 -4} \n88. This suggests that what Exact Matching shows as  the use of the Faboris  RDDs  was \nthe intended purpose of the transaction.  \n89. Thirdly , for some RDDs , although there are no contemporaneous discussions showing \nthe intended purpose of the funds, there are documents stating the drawdowns are  \n“technical disbursement [s]” with the same amount “ to be repaid” , e.g.: \n \n20  “Freeline” is a different transliteration of “Frilain” and refers to the same entity.  \nAA4/6/26\n23 \n 89.1 An email from Mr Kazantsev to Ms Gurieva and Ms Shc herbakova of 12.5.14, \nsubject “ BOK, loan issue on 12.05.14” lists four drawdowns, including three  \nRDDs  by Inkeriya, Vesta and Agroprom  as “Technical disbursement. The same \namount will be repaid ”21 {E3/225} .  \n89.2 In a Skype chat of 2.7.14, Mr Kazantsev and Ms Tishkova discuss RDDs  by \nTamersa, Vitella, Real Standart and Foksar {K6/41.12/ 4-8}:  \ndn140478kan (Kazantsev, Aleksey) 23/06/2014 08:29:07  \nloans Tamersa 207 455.73 UAH and Viitela 1 570 736.22 is PF  \n \ndn060784vta1 (Tishkova, Tatiana)  23/06/2014 08:49:17  \nAnd what to write for back of[fice]?  \n \ndn140478kan (Kazantsev, Aleksey) 23/06/2014 08:51:14  \nwrite will be repaid  \n \ndn140478kan (Kazantsev, Aleksey) 24/06/2014 07:54:20  \nloans  \nViitella 1,544,175.36 UAH (PF)  \nReal standart 593,913.60 UAH (PF)  \nand for Inkom repayment 59,445,750.00 UAH [22] \n \ndn191177cjn1 (Chechel, Yulia) 24/06/2014 07:55:20  \nReal Standart - ok!  \n \ndn060784vta1 (Tishkova, Tatiana) 24/06/2014 08:02:11  \nfor the back oﬃ ce: technical disbursement, the same will be repaid?  \n \ndn140478kan (Kazantsev, Aleksey) 24/06/2014 08:02:30  \nYes \n \ndn140478kan (Kazantsev, Aleksey) 02/07/2014 07:02:33  \nloan today for PF Foksar 2 080 140.40 UAH  \n \ndn060784vta1 (Tishkova, Tatiana) 02/07/2014 07:06:40  \nFor the back oﬃ ce: technical issuance, the same amount will be repaid?  \n \ndn140478kan (Kazantsev, Aleksey) 02/07/2014 07:14:01  \nyes \n \n89.3 Mr Kazantsev  says in a Skype  of 26.5.14 “ Favore  loan is UAH 881,564.51 UAH \ntechnical ” {K6/41.4/3} .

This matches a Favore RDD . \n89.4 That “ technical disbursement s” are funds destined for recycling is supported by the \nexamples of Uniks and Intorno, where there is both a  contemporaneous email \ndescribing them as “ Tech. disbursement[s] ” {E4/206.1}  and contemporaneous \ndiscussions expressly setting out their  purpose as repaying  loans by specified \ncompanies : D2 Opening, Schedule 2 {AA4/3/17 -20}. \n \n21  The use of this Agroprom Relevant Drawdown has not been traced by Mr Davidson {D2/18/8}. \nHowever the methodologies as applied to Agroprom have been compared by Mr Thompson \n{D1/335/1 }. This evidence is decisive in favour of Exact Matching.  \n22  The Inkom figure matches an Intermediary Drawdown. The Tamersa, Viitela and Real Standart figures \nmatch RDDs  \nAA4/6/27\n24 \n 90. Fourthly , there are messages suggesting that Borrowers ’ funds are simply being  circled \naround. For example:  \n90.1 In a Skype chat of 26.8.14, Ms Taranenko tells Mr Barsuk “ today will be Prado \n32/32 and Saltiz 9…9/9 nbu 13.3654340 ” {K6/44.5.1/ 5}. This is the day of the \nPrado ‘Unreturned’ Prepayment to Collyer of USD32m and supports the \nposition described above ( ¶64) that this was simply a circling of funds which \nhad nothing to do with the Relevant Drawdown many months before. \n90.2 In a Skype chat of 7.8.14, Ms Taranenko tells Mr Barsuk “ good morning \nagropromtechnology 40.250/40.250 per nbu ” {K6/44.5.1/2} . Similarly, this is the \nday of the Agroprom ‘Unreturned’ Prepayment to Collyer of USD40.25m and again suggests the funds were circled and had no link to the Relevant Drawdown of 8.5.14.  \n90.3 In a Skype of 19.11.13, Ms Gubanova said “ we are disbursing to Tseris too, it’s a \ndouble circle today, we need to expedite ” {K6/31.3/5 }. This precedes the Tseris \nRDDs  but shows that Tseris was being used to recycle funds. \n(4) Tracing the RDDs : (iii) contemporaneous records  \n91. The Bank’s Methodology also ignores what is shown by the Kazantsev and Gurieva \nSpreadsheets. Having previously claimed in his report that these Spreadsheets were \nconsistent with the Bank’s Methodology ( Thompson 1/3.210 -3.220) {D1/1/109 -111}, \nMr Thompson accepted in XX that various aspects were in fact consistent with Exact \nMatching and the existence of a recycling scheme. The analysis in his report was \ndeficient and imbalanced, in particular ignoring columns A I-AM of the Gurieva \nSpreadsheet which are inconsistent with the Bank’s case .  \n(i) Kazantsev Spreadsheet  \n92. As explained further in Section C5 , the Kazantsev Spreadsheet shows the Bank’s \nrecords of the paperwork used to circumvent  foreign currency regulations. I t also \nshows loops of money being recycled between borrowers and the Bank. It is possible to see these loops by comparing the changes between sheets of adjacent dates . The \nrelationship between these loops and RDDs  can be seen by looking at the Spreadsheet  \nalongside the Bank’s transaction data. As shown below, they are consistent with the recycling scheme s hown by  Exact Matching . Drawdowns by Company A are looped \nthrough a prepayment/return of prepayment before being used to repay previous borrowing by Company A or Company B.  \nAA4/6/28\n25 \n Scenario A  \n• Bank issues a drawdown of x to Company A.  \n• Company A pays a prepayment of x to Supplier A.  \n• Supplier A uses this to refund a previous prepayment of x to Company A.  \n• Company A uses this to repay lending of x to the Bank.  \nScenario B  \n• Bank issues a drawdown of x to Company A.  \n• Company A pays a prepayment of x to S"}

Scenario A  worked example:  \nDarsten  Relevant Drawdown of USD 23m on 17.2.14  (Type 2)  \n \nExact Matching  shows that the Relevant Drawdown  (under loan 4D13506D)  of \n17.2.14 was used to make a “ prepayment ” on 18.2.14 to Eurotyre  under Contract \nNo. K2901- 14 dd. 29.01.14, which Eurotyre used  to make a “ return of prepmnt ” \non 18.2.14 to Darsten under Contract No. K0511 -13 dd. 20.11.13 . Darsten in \nturn used the funds  to make repayments on 19 .2.14 and 28.2.14 under a different \nloan (4D13095D)  to the Bank : Davidson1/Appendix 8  {D2/9/25 -28}.  \n \nIn comparing the sheets  for 5.2.14 and 19.2.14 of the Kazantsev Spreadsheet, it \ncan be seen that one Darsten pre -payment has replaced  another:  \n• 5.2.14  {E7/39P/92} : Darsten  is near the top (line 9), with the line item \nrecording a payment of USD 23m to Eurotyre made on 21.11.13, with 85 \ndays elapsing on 14.2.14. The ‘Subject of Contract’ is “ Prepayments to Contract \nNo K0511- 13 dd 20.11.13 for natural rubber technical [sic]” .  \n• 19.2.14  {E7/39P/91} : the above  line item for Darsten has disappeared . A \nnew Darsten line has appeared at the bottom (line 43), with the line item \nrecording a payment of USD 23m to Eurotyre made on 18.2.14, with 85 days elapsing on 14.5.14. The ‘Subject of Contract’ is “ Prepayments according \nto the Contract No K2901- 14 dd 29.01.14for natural r ”. \n• Compare the Bank’s Methodology at { D1/52 } which wholly omits the \nreturn of prepayment from Eurotyre to Darsten of 18.2.14.  \n94. This supports the Exact Matching analysis. It also  demonstrates that recycling began \nbefore the start of the Bank’s  ‘Scheme’ , as it shows there was an existing prepayment \nfrom Darsten on  21.11.13, whereas there are no Darsten RDDs  pre-dating 17.2.14. It \nis not possible to see if there were Darsten prepayments before 21.11.13 as the \nKazantsev Spreadsheet starts on 30.12.13.  \n95. This was also not the end of recycling using Darsten. It remains in the Kazantsev \nSpreadsheet until the end on 1.9.14, with two further recycling loops . The 18.2.14 \nprepayment to Eurotyre is replaced by a payment  by Darsten to Collyer  of the same \nAA4/6/29\n26 \n amount (USD23m) dated 18.5.1423 (“Prepayments according to the Contract No 0605CD -\n1/14 dd 06.05.14for Australian manganese ore lumps ”), with 85 days elapsing on 11.8.14 \n{E7/39P/59}  (line 55) . This line item moves up the page until 12.8.14 when it \ndisappears and is replaced by a payment by Darsten to Collyer of the same amount \ndated 12.8.14 (“Prepayments according to theContract  No 0508CD-2/14 dd 05.08.14for \nAustralian manganese ore lump s”) with 85 days elapsing on 5.11.14 {E7/39P/ 10} (line \n60). These prepayments are shown on the Bank’s diagram  {D1/52 }; however, this \ndoes not show how these  prepayments  were used or funded.  It would be necessary to \nlook at the transactional data for this, a s for the first Darsten RDD.  \n96. Scenario B  worked example:  \nEmpire Relevant Drawdown of USD 37.3m on 15.8.14  (Type 1)  \nMr Davidson’s analysis of the transaction data shows the Relevant Drawdown \nbeing used to make a prepayment to Teamtrend of USD 37.3m under Contract \nNo. TE -1408145 dd 14.08.14, with Teamtrend using this in turn to repay two \nprevious prepayments to Forsa and  Empire under Contract 0306TF/14 -1 dd \n3.6.14 (with Forsa) and Contract TE -15"}

A further example of Scenario B is Dorteks. Exact Matching shows the Dorteks RDD  \nwent  to Collyer (“ for prepayments according to the Contract No1408 -DM”) which use d it to \npay Gardera (USD5m) and Amadoras (USD28m) (“ return of prpmnt the contr. 1206LPDD \n \n23  This should perhaps read 16.5.14 as it is on the 16.5.14 sheet and this would match with the transaction \ndata {D1/53}.  \nAA4/6/30\n27 \n 120614” and “ return of prepmnt the contr. 1106LPDD 11.06.14”). They use d the funds to \nmake repayments under loans to the Bank {D2/9/33- 38}. The sheets of the \nKazantsev Spreadsheet for 27.8.14 and 28.8.14 show Amadoras and Gardera’s \npayments to Collyer being part -replaced by Dorteks. Compare {E7/39P/3}  (lines 13 \nand 14) and {E7/39P/2}  (lines 12 and 59). The total debt figure stated on the  \nSpreadsheet is the same on both dates: USD1,911,877,385.00 showing no net change  \ncaused by this replacement .   \n98. This does  not purport to explain all transactions on the Kazantsev Spreadsheet . No \ncomplete analysis of how the loops shown in the Spreadsheet function and were \nfunded has been carried out . Yet it is clear that the Kazantsev Spreadsheet records a \nrecycling scheme beginning before the ‘Scheme’ period and where the URPPs  \nrecorded on the last sheet (1.9.14) {E7/39P/1}  were simply the latest in  loops of \nearlier prepayments recorded on previous pages  (some of which involve borrowers \nthat do not feature in the Ba nk’s ‘Scheme’ e.g. , Iron Union {E7/39P/98}  line 37) .  \n99. It is also clear that there is support in the Kazantsev Spreadsheet for the use of Exact Matching , most clearly shown in the case of Scenario B transactions . Yet this was \nwholly ignored by Mr Thompson in concluding  that the Kazantsev Spreadsheet was \n“consistent ” with the Bank’s Methodology (Thompson1/3.210- 3.220) {D1/1/109}.

The Gurieva Spreadsheet  {E18/213P} also shows the operation of the recycling \nscheme. Reading the spreadsheet from left to right shows how more recent \nprepayments (the URPPs ) were used to replace previous prepayments. For Type 1  \ntransactions, it records  how the URPPs  were in fact used to repay other lending. For \nType 2 transactions, it shows how the URPPs  were in fact funded.  \nType 1  transactions  \n101. As explained above  (Section B1(2)(i)),  there are eight Type 1 URPPs  where the 11 \nRDDs  which funded or part-funded them can be traced onwards from the URPPs to \nrefunds of other prepayments , then repayments of loans to the Bank. Subject to a \nAA4/6/31\n28 \n couple of apparent errors, the “Refund of said prepayment ” section of the Gurieva \nSpreadsheet  (columns AI -AM) mirrors the refunds of prepayments shown by Exact \nMatching as funded by the se URPPs . The Bank accepts this in respect of six of the \nType 1 URPPs: Bank Closing/837 {AA2/15/422} . A full set of references is set out \nin Schedule 4  (1)-(8). For example :  \nExample 1  – Milorin (lines 15 -16) \nThe spreadsheet records in the “ prepayment ” section  the two URPPs : (i) a \nprepayment of USD 9.9m on 7.7.14 to Collyer under contract 0206CM/2 dated \n2.6.14 (line 15) and (ii) a prepayment of USD 29.76m on 1.9.14 to Collyer under \ncontract 1908CM/3 dated 19.8.14. The latter is the “Type 1” URPP .  \nThe spreadsheet then records in the  “refund of the said prepayment ” section a refund \n“to the same ” of USD 29.76m to Collyer. The contract details in column AJ appear \nto be wrong as they refer to a contract between Vialint and Collye r. These details \notherwise  match with the  replacement prepayments shown in the Kazantsev \nSpreadsheet . This can be seen by comparing  sheets 28.8. 14 {E7/39P/2} (line 7) \nand 1.9.14 {E7/39P/1}  (line 59) . \nTraced using Exact Matching, these  funds from the URPP to Collyer  are used by \nCollyer to refund  a previous prepayment to Milorin before Milorin in turns uses \nthe funds to repay loans to the Bank  {D2/9/295} . \nExample 2  – Intorno (lines 72 -74) \nThe spreadsheet records in the “ prepayment ” section the two URPPs  of USD15m \neach to Teamtrend on 1.8.14 and 22.8.14, both under Contract TI -010814/3 dd \n1.8.14.  The 1.8.14 p repayment is funded directly by a USD15m RDD  (and thus is \n“Type 1”).  \nThe spreadsheet then  records in the “ refund of the said prepayment ” section a refund \nto “Ribotto”  in respect of the 1.8.14 prepayment under Contract 160414/2TR \nDD16.04.2014 with Teamtrend. These details match with the replacement prepayments shown in the Kazantsev Spreadsheet. This can be seen by comparing \nsheets 27.9.14 {E7/39P/14}  (line 4) and 1.8.14 {E7/39P/13} (lines 4 and 59).  \nTraced using Exact Matching, the funds  from the USD15m prepayment on 1.8.14 \nare used by  Teamtrend to  refund a previous prepayment to Ribotto before  being \nused by Ribotto to repay a  loan to the Bank {D2/9/260} . \n102. There are two qualifications  to this. First,  as the Bank accepts {Day25/61:20 -23} the \nGurieva Spreadsheet seems to include an error in column AJ , where details of a \ncontract between Vialint  and Collyer appear to have been copied in error into many \nrows of the spreadsheet .

Secondly,  the Gurieva Spreadsheet records the Empire URPP  \nbeing used for a “ refund of the said prepayment ” going “ to the same ” rather than to both \nEmpire and Forsa  as shown by Exact Matching  and the contemporaneous documents .  \n103. There are  four Type 1  URPPs , funded by five  RDDs  where the RDDs  could not be \ntraced onwards in the data ( using  Exact Matching ). For these, the  Gurieva Spreadsheet \nrecords in the “ To whom ” column AI “Repayment of loans in KF ”. This suggests these \nfunds  were also recycled to repay other loans : see Schedule 4 (9)-(12). “KF” is an {AA4/ 10} \n{AA4/ 10} \nAA4/6/32\n29 \n acronym  used to refer to the Cyprus branch of the Bank e.g. {E15/87} {E4/152 } \n{E2/85}24. The Bank accepts that “ KF” refers to the Cyprus branch: Bank \nClosing/834(1) {AA2/15/420} . \n104. Mr Thompson was taken to the examples of Uniks  (lines 82- 83 of the Spreadsheet ), \nDorteks  (lines 8- 9) and Intorno (lines 72- 74). He accepted  for these examples  that the \nGurieva Spreadsheet is consistent with Exact Matching and not consistent with the \nBank’s Methodology . See e.g. {Day24/78: 18-24}:25 \nA…I'm making it quite clear that I entirely accept that in the examples we're \nlooking at, the Gurieva  spreadsheet, assuming we're understanding it in the \nright way, is supportive of Mr Davidson's analysis.  \nQ.   And not consistent with the case that you were asked to comment on?  \nA.   Yes. \n105. He also accepted  the general proposition that the funds used in Type 1 transactions \nwere returned to the Bank  with no net impact {Day24/73:17- 21}:  \nQ.  I'm going to suggest, in all the type 1 cases, where you have a drawdown, a prepayment \nand you stop your analysis at that point, the reality is that that prepayment is \nimmediately returned within hours on the same day.  \nA.   On a funds flow basis, yes.  \nQ.   So the net position of the Bank in terms of its ledgers remains the same.  There's simply \na change in the name of the borrower?  \nA.   Yes. \nType 2 Transactions  \n106. For these  transactions, Exact Matching shows that the RDDs  did not fund the URPPs  \nat all . The experts have not analysed how the se URPPs  were actually funded. The \nGurieva Spreadsheet appears to show (in the “ refund of the said prepayment ” section) that \nthey were funded  by returns of other prepayments.  \n107. To understand how these returns of prepayments were in turn funded, it  is necessary \nto look at the transactional data . Although this has not been analysed by the ex perts , \nit is possible to see the funding position for at least some of the URPPs on the face of \nthe transactional data. A set of extracts of the Defendant Suppliers’ data has been \nuploaded at {K7 -D/2P}  and a marked -up version of the Gurieva Spreadsheet \nmatching the URPPs to the data  is at Schedule 5 . From this it can be seen that many \nURPPs were funded by intra- day overdrafts.   \n \n24  It is possible to see in this document that “КФ” in the original email has been transliterated  \ninconsistently  as “KF” and “CB”, both referring to the Cyprus Branch {E2/85L} {E2/85}  \n25  Further references are {Day23/67:15} -69:5, {Day24/73:4- 16}, {Day24/77:23} -78:24,  {Day24/80:3} \n-81:4, {Day24/88:14} -90:17  {AA4/ 11} \nAA4/6/33\n30 \n 108.

[…] It’s not the case, is it that universally money -- in these situations, where you \nget a return of prepayment and a new prepayment, it is not the case that universally \nit's always funded from an intra -day overdraft?  \nA.  So it ’s not been part of my analysis to try and identify where -- what is the \nsource of money that came in. So on my analysis, generally there would not \nbe a dotted line, there would be a solid line. It would not be part of my \nanalysis then to identify where new  money has come in from once I ’ve shown \nthat the money, save from the top green line, has gone, by direct tracing, \nelsewhere. But my understanding is that it can be --  and overnight it can be \nother money that physically comes in from somebody els e, so there are \ndifferent patterns there, I understand.  \nQ.  That's very fair, Mr Davidson. I agree, you've not analysed it in your report and I \nthink, for present purposes, it's enough to say that there are some examples where it comes f rom an overdraft and some where it doesn't.  \nA.   Correct.  I think there are some actually that come from other drawdowns by other people, but ...  \nQ.   I think that is right as well.  \nA.   Yes. \n109. Having been taken to two examples (Prado and Tseris) where the  transactional data \nshow s that the  returns  were funded by overdrafts {Day24/82:8} -87:13,  \n{Day24/90:18} -92:18, Mr Thompson accepted the  general proposition that Type 2 \nURPPs  have no net impact on the Bank  {Day24/74:25} - 75:25:  \nQ.   But I just wanted to explain that those two are what I'm going to describe as \"type \n2\".  That is cases where the drawdown has happened 90 or 180 days or more before \n–  \nA.   Yes.  \nQ.  --  and there have been at least one or two loops prior to the transaction we're seeing \nhere.  \nA.   Yes.  \nQ.   Let me put it to you as a matter of generality and then we'll look at the particular examples, possibly after lunch.  The reality on a funds flow basis is that each of those type 2 prepayments are in fact not merely immediately refunded.  It is the \nrefund itself that allows the prepayment to be made.  Do you understand what I'm \nsaying?  \nA.   Yes, I do.  \nQ.   In other words, Collyer or Teamtrend, whoever it is, create an intra -day overdraft \neffectively on their account so they can make the prepayment or -- sorry -- make \nthe refund that we have in the refund column, and that then goes out to Prado or \nTseris, who ever it is, and that allows them to make the prepayment.  \nA.   Yes.  \nQ.   So, again, the position in type 2 is that the Bank's position is netted off.  There is \nan intra -day movement of funds, but the net position remains the same?  \nA.   Yes. \n \n26  The Bank’s position in closing is more ambiguous: Bank Closing/834(2) {AA2/15/421}.  It will no \ndoubt clarify the position if it does not accept these URPPs were funded by overdrafts.  \nAA4/6/34\n31 \n Consistency with Exact Matching and not the  Bank’s Methodology  \n110.

Appendix 3-5- 3 {D1/118} to his report shows that he had in \nfact ignored the whole “ Refund of the said prepayment ” section of the Spreadsheet.

And you say that that part of the spreadsheet justifies your analysis that ends at the \nprepayment?  \nA.   I wouldn't put it like that.  My analysis is, as I said before, the transaction of data.  All I observe is, in relation to this spreadsheet and indeed the Kazantsev spreadsheet, they are contemporaneous documents that list the unreturned prepayments, so they support that figure.  But that's as far as I go.  I'm not using this as the core of my answer that the Bank's case is accurate and complete; I'm merely observing that these figures and the figures in the Kazantsev spreadsheet are the same as those in th e Bank's \nclaim .                                                                                          {Day24/67:1 -12} \n \nQ.   You were specifically asked whether the Bank's case was consistent with the Gurieva spreadsheet and I am going to suggest that that heading of these sections, \"Refund of the said prepayment\", if it's accurate, is inconsistent with the Bank's case, so that is precisely one of the questions you should have been asking yourself and answering.  \nA.  I think I could have said that, \"There are certain lines in this, if it is accurate, \nthat is consistent with Mr Davidson's approach\".  That I could have said.  \n{Day24/70:18} - 71:2 \n \nA.

I think you can help with this since you are an accountant: the Bank's methodology does not take account of the Bank's own accounting data or the Kazantsev or the Gurieva spreadsheets, does it?  \nA.   I would disagree with that. It certainly takes account of the Bank's transactional data, it just interprets it in a different way, and it takes account \nof the certain aspects of the Kazantsev and Gurieva spreadsheets, but not all \nof them.                                          {Day2 4/93:20} - 94:3 \n \nAA4/6/35\n32 \n 111. Ultimately, Mr Thompson made the crucial concession that it “ is a possibility ” that “ this \nspreadsheet records the financial fact on the ground that, of the 1.911 prepayments, 1.811 immediately \ncycled back to the Bank” {Day24/67:18- 22}, also agreeing as follows:  \nQ.   So there ’s no reason, is there, for you to suggest that the Gurieva spreadsheet is \nanything other than accurate in saying that the prepayments are refunded, in the \ncase of type 1, immediately after they ’re made, and in case of type 2, before they ’re \nmade by the overdraft facility?  \nA.   No.                                                                                        {Day24/92:19- 25} \n(5) Tracing the RDDs : impact of loan recycling  for ‘theft ’ and ‘loss ’ \n112.

The examples given were U niks an d Dorteks.  \n113. Where RDDs  are recycled, there are simply a numbers of ledger entries, as Mr \nThompson accepted: {Day23/130:2} -131:15 . In reality there has been no ‘theft’ from \nthe Bank – nothing has been ‘appropriated’ at all.  \n(6) The Bank’s Loan Book: no significant increase  \n114. An analysis of the Bank’s loan book over the Relevant Drawdown period provides \nadditional support for the conclusion that the RDDs  caused no loss.  \n115. Mr Steadman compared  the relative size of the Bank’s loan portfolio for “Relevant \nCustomers” the day before the first RDD (31.10.13) and on the day of the last RDD  \nAA4/6/36\n33 \n (1.9.14). He determined that there was an overall net increase in outstanding principal \non the loan book of  only USD72m and that the remainder of the increase represented \naccrued interest of  USD618.3m: Steadman1/4.3.6- 4.3.8 {D3/1/21}. As he explained \nin XX: \nA.  …  What I observe is it's the largest group that I have to  work from which are \nsomehow connected to the events, and the observation that I draw is that the \nloan book remains broadly flat apart from accrued interest, which suggests to \nme that, in essence, there is a loan recycling going on, with interest being hun g \nup in subsequent loans.  That's what it suggests.                   {Day26/39:21} - 40:2 \n116. This is consistent with the RDDs  being a series of ledger entries  and corroborat es the \nfindings from the Exact Matching and Bridging Loan methodologies , showing the \nRDDs  being looped around in the Bank. \n117. The Bank levels three  purported criticisms at this analysis.  \n118. First, that Mr Steadman looked at the loan book for  all Relevant Customers \n(Thompson2/6.85- 6.90) {D1/347/98}  rather than some unspecified narrower set of \ncustomers . As Mr Steadman explained in XX, he did not selectively choose these  \ncustomers . He understood they were  selected by the parties and Court for disclosure \n{Day26/36:5- 7}, Steadman 1 {D3/1/8}  and that it was the “ widest list of parties that are \nconnected in some way to the events ” {Day26/38:17- 18}. Further, he explained that it was \nthe “widest complete data set that I was provided with ” {Day26/82:5- 6}. \n119. This “ includes accounts of the Borrowers, borrowers of the Intermediary Loans, New Borrowers; and \nentities identified by the Bank and D1 as being companies through whose accounts allegedly relevant \nfunds passed; as well as those customers whose loan balances wer e repaid through the Transformation .” \nSteadman1/4.1.5 {D3/1/19}.

{"start": 101500, "text": "5- 6}. \n119. This “ includes accounts of the Borrowers, borrowers of the Intermediary Loans, New Borrowers; and \nentities identified by the Bank and D1 as being companies through whose accounts allegedly relevant \nfunds passed; as well as those customers whose loan balances wer e repaid through the Transformation .” \nSteadman1/4.1.5 {D3/1/19}. The data “ depicts  the movement of Relevant Loan Drawdowns, \nthe Intermediary Loans, the repayment of the Relevant and Intermediary Loans, including the Asset \nTransfer and the Transformat ion, as well as the destination of  the Relevant Loan Drawdow ns”: \nSteadman1 /App. 1.3/1.32 -1.3.3 {D3/4/3} . \n120. The list of 466 “Relevant Customers” was in fact agreed by D1 and the Bank in correspondence {L/10.20.02/4 }, {L/10.21.1}, {L/10.21.2 } as the list of customers \nrelevant to the issues  and was then used by the Bank in its s. 1B DRD, Annex A \n{A4/2/17}  approved by the 1\nst CMC Order dated 21.10.22 {A6/49} , as the basis for \ndisclosure of transactional data. \n121. Secondly , that considering only the net change in the portfolio does not tell you how \ndrawdowns were used or loans repaid (Thompson2/6.88 -6.90) {D1/347/99} . As Mr \nSteadman explained, tracing the use of drawdowns  is not the purpose of this exercise . \nAA4/6/37\n34 \n That work is done by Exact Matching.  This exercise provides a different way of \nlooking at the question of whether there has been misappropriation: “ if the Bank’s loan \nportfolio had increased during this period by an amount equivalent in size of the RDDs , then it would \nfollow that these amounts may have been misappropriated, rather than used to repay other loans of the \nBank ” (Steadman3/3.3.2} {D3/13 .1/14}. This also explains why looking at a wider \npopulation than just, say, Borrowers or Intermediary Borrowers is appropriate.  The \nBank attempted to criticise this on the basis that some RDDs  were used to repay loans \nof operating companies. As explained below, its reliance on such transaction chains is inconsistent with its own Methodology . Further, the Bank has not pleaded any case \nthat it suffered loss on the basis that bad loans were used to repay good loans. It says \nthat the RDDs  were stolen  and has disclaimed any claim that  its loss was caused by \nthe impairment of loans.\n \n122. Thirdly , that Mr Steadman “ ignored ” the increase in interest. As Mr Steadman explained \nin XX, he did not ignore this. The increase in interest is clearly set out in his report : \n“I’m saying the change in the loan book between period A and period B is the amount of interest \nthat’s been charged between period [A] and period [B] ” {Day26/68:22} -69:3. The point is \nthat his analysis shows that the increase in the size of the Bank’s loan book during the \nrelevant period was almost entirely driven by the accrual of interest, rather than an increase in the level of lending.  Again, this is inconsistent with the occurrence of a \nmisappropriation during this time period.\n \n123. Ultimately, as Mr Steadman accepted, there are limits to his loan book analysis because \nnot all of the relevant data has been made available by the Bank.  However, the analysis \ndoes enable Mr Steadman to  conclude that  the data is  indicative of a loan recycling \nscheme with no loss caused to the Bank {Day26/44:16} -45:4 (see also {Day26/45:9-\n13} {Day26/68:16- 18}, Steadman 3/Section 3.3 {D3/13 .1/14}): \nA. […] What I say about this analysis is it does not follow that the relevant loans caused \nthe Bank loss.  If there's a loan recycling scheme going on -- and a loan recycling scheme \nis suggested by the analysis of the loan book because the only difference is accr ued \ninterest over the period --  if that is right, then the concept of the Bank's loss in \naccounting terms becomes something that needs further analysis because the loss itself \ncould have been suffered at different points.

{"start": 105000, "text": "ank loss.  If there's a loan recycling scheme going on -- and a loan recycling scheme \nis suggested by the analysis of the loan book because the only difference is accr ued \ninterest over the period --  if that is right, then the concept of the Bank's loss in \naccounting terms becomes something that needs further analysis because the loss itself \ncould have been suffered at different points.  It could be covering up an  earlier loss, it \ncould be increasing a loss over the period or it could be, as the Bank says, a loss at the end of the period.  We can't determine that without further enquiry, and that's the point of this analysis.  \n124. None of the Bank’s criticisms address the substantive point that the lack of significant \nchange in the outstanding principal of the loan portfolio is consistent with the RDDs  \nhaving caused the Bank no net loss.  Even  Mr Thompson accepts that “ loan recycling is \nAA4/6/38\n35 \n readily apparent in the available transactional data”: Thompson2/6.98 {D1/347/101} . He \nalso accepted that the exercise of looking at change in the loan portfolio was a “possible \nway of thinking about ” whether there had been a theft {Day24/106:3} - 107:2.  \n(7) The Bank’s Ecosystem: no outflow of RDDs   \n125. Yet further  support is provided by Mr Steadman’s second analysis, which shows that \nno sums from the RDDs  were transferred by  the Borrowers or Intermediary \nBorrowers to accounts outside the Bank: Steadman1/5.3 {D3/1/25}  {Day26/51:15-\n18}.27 They  did not leave the Bank’s eco -system  and were just ledger en tries on the \nBank’s  balance sheet. For the Bank to have parted with any money, this would require \na transfer to a third -party bank or an extraction in cash.  As Mr Steadman explained:  \n[…] if one is looking for misappropriation, the first question should be to ask, \"What \nhappened to the money?\".  The quickest way to look at that is to say, \"Has any of the \nmoney left PrivatBank directly?\", and by \"directly\", from the borrowers and the \ninterm ediary borrowers.                                                                        {Day26/53:6 -11} \n126. This gives the lie  to the Bank’s suggestion that the facts of this  claim  are “no different \nthan if the first and second defendants had visited the Bank’s vaults on 270 times and over those 270 \noccasions simply taken out $2 billion of the Bank’s money” .28 No money was taken from the \nvaults. As Mr Davidson said, “ the analogy of going into the bank vault and coming out of the \nbank vault, I'm not sure that's correct because I'm not sure that anybody [sic] has actually left the bank vault at all in this transaction  […] In terms of the sort of visuals of it, money is just moving \naround different shelves of the bank vault .” {Day25/85:12} -86:5.  In reality, a ll that occurred \nwas the making of a series of ledger entries recording the notional creation and \ndischarge of debt obligations between the Bank and Borrowers.  The only effect  of this \nexercise was to change the identities of the persons owing money to the Bank  (other \nborrowers to  Borrowers to Intermediary Borrowers to  New Borrower s) and the \ninstruments under which such funds were recorded a s owing.  There was no movement \nof value outside the Bank , no ‘appropriation’  and, so far as can be establishe d, no net \nloss to the Bank  during this period.  \n127. The lack of any extraction of value from the Bank, taken with Mr Steadman’s analysis \nof the Bank’s loan book , strengthens the inevitable conclusion that what was really \noccurring was loan recycling. Mr Steadman explained {Day26/55:10- 16}: \n \n27  Mr Steadman looked at transactions of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers for the period \nbetween 1.11.13 (the date of the first Relevant Drawdown) and Nationalisation.  \n28  {Day2/60:25} -61:3 \nAA4/6/39\n36 \n […] given that you've seen a relationship between loans being advanced for the 46629 \nand loans being repaid for the 466 that, as you say, is broadly flat, I think, t"}

This exercise goes hand in hand with the assessment of whether the URPPs  in fact left \nthe Bank (considered in Section B2 below), with the end result that both points at \nwhich the Bank has variously said money was “stolen” or “extracted” have been \nconsidered. As Mr Steadman explained:  \nTo my mind there's two important groups of customers to look at. One are the \nborrowers and the intermediary borrowers and the other one are the defendant suppliers.  Now, Mr Thompson has done the analysis of payments out of the defendant suppliers and I ha ve done the analysis of payments out of the borrowers.  The exercise \ninvolving all 466, however many it is, relevant customers it seemed to me is best covered by the tracing exercise which is following the actual funds.                {Day26/54:12- 21} \n129. Mr Thompson agrees with Mr Steadman’s conclusions on what the data shows  \n{Day24/108:21} -109:1 . However, again he makes various misplaced criticisms of Mr \nSteadman’s methodology. \n130. First, that Mr Steadman should not have focused just on Borrowers and Intermediary \nBorrowers , but should have included all Relevant Customers: Thompson2/6.111- 114 \n{D1/347/106} . This is misplaced . The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether \nthere was a misappropriation of the RDDs : Steadman3/3.2 {D3/13 .1/12}. Again, it  is \nnot a tracing exercise. Further, as Mr Steadman explained, looking at all the Relevant \nCustomers’ data would be a futile exercise,  as it would contain thousands of irrelevant \npayments (in particular as this group includes trading com panies) {Day26/55:21 -25}: \n“there is so much noise from the trading customers ” {Day26/64:25} -65:1. This can be seen in \nMr Thompson’s analysis (Appendix 6 -4-1) {D1/435.1P} . Further, no useful \nconclusions can be drawn from the destination of payments by the other 416 customers without tracing if they have any link to the RDDs . Mr Thompson’s analysis \nof the other 416 customers (Thompson2/6.120ff)  {D1/347/109}  should be ignored.  \nA.  The two exercises are complementary.  The reason that we don't need to look at the \n466 for the second exercise is because we know that within that there's a whole -- \nhundreds of transactions which have got nothing to do with this and equally we know from the first analysis have nothing to do with the loan book.  So they're trading \noperations, they're payment of salaries, they're presumably receipts from the sales of goods.  So they don't touch the loan book.  We know that from analysis one.  So there's no point analysing those transactions in point two because they've got nothing to do with the issue.  The issue is: has there been a misappropriation from the borrower set?  \n \n29  The “466” refers to the Relevant Customers used to assess the movement of the Bank’s loan book.  \nAA4/6/40\n37 \n So you say it's inconsistent.

As Mr Steadman \nexplain ed, he is looking at indications of “ misappropriation away from the Bank, away from \naccounts of the Bank to other bank accounts, to other third parties outside of the PrivatBank, what I \ncall the \"PrivatBank ecosystem\" ” {Day26/9:4- 7}. \n132. T hirdly , that he “ excludes from his analysis funds from Relevant Drawdowns which (according to \nthe Lafferty Spreadsheets) are paid to accounts of trading companies the Bank alleges were owned and/or controlled by the First and/or Second Defendants ”: Thompson2/6.116, 6.119 \n{D1/347/108} . First,  none of the parties rely upon the Lafferty Spreadsheets. \nSecondly, payments to trading companies have not been ‘excluded’. To the extent that \nthere is a payment from a Borrower or Intermediary Borrower to one of those \ncompanies it would be included {Day26/52:6- 14}. If funds flow to a trading company \nfurther down the transaction chain, they do not fall within this analysis, but within the \ntracing analysis.  \n(8) RDDs  which cannot be traced  \n133. USD5 63m of the RDDs  – or USD 550m of  the RDD  Portions - “ cannot be easily traced \nusing Exact Matching ”.30 The Bank claims the inability to ascertain  what happened to \nthese RDDs  is in itself an indication of misappropriation. Mr Steadman pointed out \nthe flaw in this assertion:  \nA.  Well, I don't think so.  I think it's an indication that they can't follow what's happened \nto the money, I'm assuming because it's got itself commingled with other funds such that you can't tell how the funds flow forward.  If we're asked to say has there been a misappropriation, then I think there has to be an end point to determinatively answer that question rather than, \"I don't know, therefore it's misappropriation\".\n                                                                          \n{Day26/28:10- 17} \n134. It cannot be presumed that where RDDs  cannot be traced they were stolen. If RDDs  \ncould be traced into the pocket of Mr Kolomoisky or Mr Bogolyubov, Mr Thompson \nwould no doubt have identified this .  \n \n30  The figure of USD557m was given in the Joint Statement at JEM/3.2.1 {D4/1/5}. Mr Davidson since \nagreed with Mr Thompson’s analysis that USD29m of additional RDDs could be traced using Exact \nMatching: Thompson2/Table 5 -3 {D1/347/60} {Day25/86:19} - 87:6. However, there appears to have \nbeen an error in the calculation of the original USD557m. The correct total figure of RDDs that have \nnot been traced using Exact Matching is USD5 63m. \nAA4/6/41\n38 \n (9) “Hallmarks of money laundering”  \n135. The Bank claims that there are indications of money laundering which suggest that \nthere has been a misappropriation. As Mr Steadman explained, this is to conflate two \ndifferent issues: “ I fail to see the connection between misappropriation and money laundering. \nMoney laundering is disguising the proceeds that have been misappropriated ” {Day26/10:1 -18}. \nThe relevant question here is whether funds have been misappropriated; it is a different \nquestion to ask if misappropriated money has then been laundered. Mr Steadman’s \nanalyses and the tracing exercise address the former.  \n136. As he also explained, many of the suggested hallmarks of money laundering relied \nupon by the Bank are also “ the hallmarks of loan recycling ” {Day26/12:20} -13:17  \n{Day26/19:21} - 20:3 {Day26/27:12- 14}.

He explained this further in Re -X: \nQ.   You were asked some questions about money laundering and loan recycling and I \nwould like you to just try and explain what they have in common and where they may \ndiffer.  Can you start with whether they may be used to hide again or to disguise a loss?  \nIf we take loan recycling first, so far as your expert view is concerned of the loan \nrecycling, what in your opinion does it normally represent?  \nA.   Right.  So the point about money laundering or these sort of transactions is that their purpose is to disguise something.  In the case of money laundering, the \npurpose is to disguise the funds of criminal proceeds or terrorism or however \nit's particularly defined.  In the case of a loan recycling scheme, similar \ntransactions might be used to disguise the fact that a loan that is not recoverable \nor a loss that should be booked -- if you route the money, that loan appears to \nbe refreshed or a borrower co me in place.  So the transactions may be similar.  \nTheir purpose is the same in that it is disguising something that's happened. If \nyou look at the transactions, you cannot say whether that is for money -\nlaundering purposes or that is for loan -recycling pur poses .  \nQ.   And if you look at it -- firstly, did you look at the data here to consider that distinction, \nwhether you were looking at money laundering --  that is covering up the presence of \ndirty money, let's call it that -- or whether you were looking at something that looked \nlike loan recycling and the purposes that that served?  \nA.   Everything I've seen points to loan recycling or borrower recycling: the Gurieva \nspreadsheets showing the rolling over the position, the transactions which end \nup the same after a couple of days, just with different loans and different \nborrowers.  The spin  of the Cyprus borrowing, the more complex transactions, \nI don't have a particular answer as to why those transactions are more complex \nthan others, but they are the minority .                                                                 \n{Day26/82:7} - 83:18  \n(10) Conclusion  \n137. Taking all of this evidence together – tracing, contemporaneous documents and \nanalysis of accounts – the only conclusion that can be drawn is that there was no \nmisappropriation by way of the RDDs . Instead, t hey fall in the middle  of a longer -\nterm loan  recycling scheme. This does not rule out a loss having been suffered at an \nearlier stage (with the loan recycling covering up a ‘hole in the books’) or later when \nAA4/6/42\n39 \n the Bank impaired its accounts in 2016, recognising a loss in respect of the New Loans , \nas Mr Steadman explained: {Day26/84: 1-24}. Yet the Bank does not claim in relation \nto – and has not sought to evidence - either such loss.   \n138. Conversely , the Bank’s case requires the Court to shut its eyes to the relevant evidence, \nas accepted by Mr Thompson:  \nQ.  You have to ignore half of the Bank's transactional data, though, don't you?  \nA.  You do.  On the other hand -- I suppose the other way of looking at it is, on a \nfunds flow methodology, you're ignoring a lot of the transaction narratives.  \nQ.  You also have to ignore what's in the Skypes and emails?  \nA.  Yes.  \nQ.  And you have to ignore the second part of Ms Gurieva's spreadsheet?  \nA.  Yes.  Q.  Right.  That's not an appropriate methodology, is it?  \nA.  Ultimately I think that is for his Lordship to decide, not me.  \n{Day24/99:13} - 100:4  \n139.

Indeed, the Bank has not adduce d any evidence suggesting that there was  a loss. Mr \nThompson did not consider the question of loss in his reports at all, merely performing \ncalculations as instructed by the Bank  {D1/1/279}. When challenged i n XX h e \naccepted that there was or might be no accounting loss  {Day24/10 1:14} -103:9. While \nloss is ultimately a legal issue, it is hard to conceive of circumstances where  a \nmisappropriation claim could be established in the absence of an accounting loss . And \nso, no “ theft from the Bank’s vaults ” has been shown. \n140. The significance of this reality is not addressed by the Bank when it asks  the Court to \ninfer Mr Bogolyubov must have known of and been complicit in the taking of URPPs \nor the RDDs .  \nB2. NO ‘MISAPPROPRIATION ’ OF THE ‘UNRETURNED ’ PREPAYMENTS  \n141. The Bank has not attempted to show how it is said that, assuming a link can be drawn \nbetween RDDs  and URPPs , Mr Bogolyubov benefitted from the URPPs . The Bank \nonly goes as far to say that the URPPs  were not returned and stops the tracing exercise \nwhen the funds reach D3 -8. The forensic accounting experts are agreed that the \nURPPs  could not in themselves give rise to an accounting loss to the Bank {D4/2/17} \n¶6.4 {Day24/101:14- 25}.  \n142. It is instructive to look at Mr Thompson’s analysis of what happened to the URPPs  in \nhis response to D3 -8’s case that they transferred the same amount as the URPPs  \nAA4/6/43\n40 \n immediately on to bank accounts of other customers of the Bank, as set out at Annex \nD to D3 -8 RAD {A1/24} . Mr Thompson’s evidence is that the URPPs  “were not returned \nto the Borrowers which made them by reference to the same Supply Agreement ” (Thompson1/8.3) \n{D1/1/284} . Yet he also stated that he was “ largely able to verify ” the information in \nAnnex D in the Bank’s transactional data (Thompson1/8.7} {D1/1/286} . Thus, it \nappears that Mr Thompson accepts that the transactional data shows the URPPs  being \ntransferred immediately on to other bank accounts of other customers at the Bank. \n143. Moreover, Mr Thompson’s table at {D1/435.1P}  shows that there are very few \npayments from D3 -8 to accounts external to the Bank  at all, by contrast with the other \nmain customers where there are all the trading transactions. Mr Steadman pointed this out in XX:  \nA.  Yes, and the only point of interest that I take from this section, if I may, is \n{D1/347/111}, if we could turn that up.  What Mr Thompson has done here is he has analysed payments to third --  can we say \"third ...\" -- other bank accounts by customer \ntype, and the first one there is \"Defendant Supplier\".  That's D3 to D8, as I understand \nit.  Now, the figure there is about $245 million, 228 payments.  That's actually over a period up until I think 2016. If you look in the detail of the appendix, this tells me that the payments to third party accounts out of the defendant suppliers in the relevant period was less than $25 million .  So even from D3 to D8, who were the \nbeneficiaries of the unreturned prepayments, the story can't stop there because there's not $1.9 billion of payments out of the defendant suppliers to other banks.  So that's what I take from Mr Thompson's analysis.  \n{Day26/56:17}  (emphasis added) \n Look, on this table, the Bank's case, as I understand it, is that the defendant suppliers benefitted from unreturned prepayments totalling US $1.9 billion.  On the face of it, this table, which is for the period to December 2016, there's only $245 million that goes \nfrom the defendant suppliers to other bank accounts.

I'm saying it's the fact that -- what's interesting here is if you are analysing payments \nfrom customers to external banks, the defendant suppliers do not pay away the 1.9 billion. Now, as a forensic accountant, that means the picture is incomplete because those funds have not been traced.  \n{Day26/62:25} - 63:13  (and see also {Day26/61:15- 20}) \n144. Mr Thompson himself has accepted that the URPPs  (as opposed to the RDDs ) were \ntransferred to other accounts at the Bank as shown by {A1/24}: Thompson1/8.3 \n{D1/1/284} . That is to say that D3 -8 did not transfer the URPPs  outside the Bank. \nFurther analysis of the data demonstrates that D3 -8 made hardly any payments to \nentities  outside of the Bank at all  over the ‘Unreturned’ Prepayment period. The \nrelevant data is extracted in a table at Schedule 6. Indeed, a comparison of the total \nnet opening and closing bal ances for D3 -8 over this period shows little change, \nsupporting the proposition that they were being used in a recycling scheme.   {AA4/ 12} \nAA4/6/44\n41 \n 145. Thus, even had the Bank sought to do so, it could not show that the URPPs  ever left \nits ‘eco system ’. This is inconsistent with the URPPs  having given rise to any loss . \nAgain, the Bank does not part with any money.  \n146. Section B5  below  focuses on the Bank’s attempts to suggest that it is the RDDs not \nthe U RPPs that caused loss and benefitted Mr Bogolyubov  in ways inconsistent with \nthe Bank’s case that those drawdowns went to fund URPPs .  \nB3. RELEVANT DRAWDOWNS WHICH ARE “OUTLIERS ” \n147. The RDDs  by four companies (Celastrina, Densitron, Fiastra and Prominmet) do not \nfit into the Bank’s ‘Scheme’. They do not feature in the “currency scheme” recorded \nin the Kazantsev Spreadsheet, nor do they appear on the Gurieva Spreadsheet. They \nare “outliers” (i n the Bank’s own words {Day1/14:4 -5}) which cannot be wrangled \ninto the ‘Scheme’ however it is viewed.  \n148. Moreover, the claim s in relation to these companies are clearly time barred , since they \nwere added by amendment in Jul 20  after the expiry of limitation but do not arise from \nthe same or substantially same facts as originally pleaded . Mr Bogolyubov adopts the \nsubmissions in D1 Opening/Section I3 {AA3/1/102} in this regard . The different \nnature of the claims against these Borrowers is explained further below .  \n(1) The Cypriot Borrowers  \n149. As the Bank recognises, the Cypriot Borrowers are “outliers” as they entered into no \nRSAs and so made no prepayments  to any suppliers: Bank Opening/fn.166 \n{AA2/1/94}. On the facts, they do not fit into the Bank’s alleged ‘Scheme’.  \n150. Further evidence of their outlier status includes that:  \n150.1  they were not BOK clients (Bank Opening/24) {AA2/1/20}, yet the Bank says that it was BOK that carried out the scheme; and  \n150.2  they do not feature on the Kazantsev or Gurieva Spreadsheets, which are said to be designed so the employees can keep track of the ‘Scheme’: Bank \nOpening/239 -242 {AA2/1/105}, Reply/7 A.1 {A1/25/6} , Bank ’s CMC \nSkeleton /26.1(1)  {G2/74/23} . The Bank claims in its opening that the \nKazantsev Spreadsheet “ lists the same companies (i.e. Borrowers and D3 -8) as the Bank \nhas identified as being involved in the Misappropriation ” noting only in a footnote \n(fn.181) that the spreadsheet does not in fact list the Cypriot B orrowers or \nProminmet. The Bank seeks to get round this by saying that the spreadsheet \nAA4/6/45\n42 \n “ident"}
{"start": 126000, "text": "e’: Bank \nOpening/239 -242 {AA2/1/105}, Reply/7 A.1 {A1/25/6} , Bank ’s CMC \nSkeleton /26.1(1)  {G2/74/23} . The Bank claims in its opening that the \nKazantsev Spreadsheet “ lists the same companies (i.e. Borrowers and D3 -8) as the Bank \nhas identified as being involved in the Misappropriation ” noting only in a footnote \n(fn.181) that the spreadsheet does not in fact list the Cypriot B orrowers or \nProminmet. The Bank seeks to get round this by saying that the spreadsheet \nAA4/6/45\n42 \n “identifies the immediate source of the prepayment (i.e. Paradiz and Foxar)”; however, \nthe Bank’s case on how it is said that the Cypriot RDDs  funded these \nprepayments is convoluted and unsustainable, as shown below. \n151. Due to this, the Bank has had to mould its accounting “methodology” to use a n \nincoherent combination of tracing methodologies to link the Cypriot Borrower RDDs  \nto the Unreturned Prepayments. The Bank’s Methodology as applied uncritically by \nMr Thompson is shown at {D1/70} {D1/186} and {D1/110}. The methodology is \ninconsistent with the Bank’s general approach as it ignores multiple supply agreement \nreferences, using Exact Matching instead, as follows:  \n151.1  Exact Matching is used to trace the funds from the Cypriot Borrowers \n(Densitron, Fiastra and Celastrina) through 12 other borrowers to Alfatrader and Milorin, where the methodology switches to supply agreement matching .  \n151.2  The funds are traced using Exact Matching  between some of these companies \ndespite (on the Bank’s Methodology) being unreturned prepayments. This is the case for the tracing of funds  from Adriana to Milorin to Glasgow/Lemiserf \n{D1/70} and from Adriana to Alfatrader to Glasgow/Lemiserf {D1/186}. As \ncan be seen in these diagrams, different supply agreements are referred to in each transaction yet the Bank does not wait for a matching supply agreement reference to trace the payment on.  \n152. Mr Thompson accepted in XX that these examples “ involve Exact Matching to get past an \nUnreturned Prepayment ”. He sought to justify this by saying that tracing backwards  from \nthe URPPs  using the Bank’s Methodology would get you to the Cypriot RDDs  \n{Day24/98:14- 21}. However, as he accepted, this is not straightforward. Tracing \nbackwards from these URPPs  only gets you to the Cypriot Borrower RDDs  if certain \nchoices are made as to the methodology to use for each stage. For example, for Milorin {D1/70} the choic e is made to connect the USD29.8m payment of 5.6.14 from \nLemiserf to Milorn to a previous payment of 13.3.14 from Milorin to Lemiserf using \nSupply Agreement Reference matching rather than using Exact Matching to see where \nthe funds for the 5.6.14 payment in fact came from. A different choice is made in \nrespect of the 3.3.14 payment from Adriana to Milorin, where Mr Thompson instead uses Exact Matching to see where Adriana obtained the USD60m of funds from.  \n153. Mr Davidson has traced these RDDs  (which took place in Mar  14) using a combination \nof Exact Matching and the Bridging Loan Methodology as shown in his diagrams at \nAA4/6/46\n43 \n {D2/9/704- 709}31. The funds circle back within two days to repay the same amounts \nunder the same loans.  \n(2) Prominmet  \n154. Prominmet32 is an even more prominent anomaly, as it is a Ukrainian Borrower yet \ndoes not fit in at all with the other Ukrainian Borrowers. \n155. First, the Prominmet Relevant Loan is not a BOK loan, as the Bank accepts  (Bank \nOpening/197(2) ) {AA2/1/87 -88}, significant  where its  ‘Scheme’ was run by BOK.  \n155.1  T he “initiating unit” for the Prominmet Relevant Loan was the “ Credit Analysts \nDepartment ” {F1/34/3} rather than “ BOK” as for all other Ukrainian \nBorrowers. The Bank says that Prominmet was nonetheless a customer of \nBOK, relying on {E12/316P}  (a list of BOK clients): Bank Opening/24, fn.22 \n{AA2/1/20}; however, this does not change the fact that the  Relevant Loan \nwas not initiated by BOK.  \n155.2  Skype chats between BOK employees sugges"}

The Bank says that Prominmet was nonetheless a customer of \nBOK, relying on {E12/316P}  (a list of BOK clients): Bank Opening/24, fn.22 \n{AA2/1/20}; however, this does not change the fact that the  Relevant Loan \nwas not initiated by BOK.  \n155.2  Skype chats between BOK employees suggest they  did not consider the \nProminmet Relevant Loan to be anything to do with them: e.g.  on 5.5.14, Ms \nGryn messaged Ms Koval “ Payment of interest according to loan agreement \nNDNH2LKI04220 [the Prominmet Relevant Loan] dated 20.09.2013. It’s not our \nloan agreement, so I wasn’t told about it. ” {K6/39.4/6 } and on 6.6.14, Ms Rokoman \nforwarded a message from Mr Kazantsev to Ms Gryn saying “ there is a folder with \nProminmet…which is not ours, there are no loans ” {K6/41.11/4 }. \n156. Secondly, other features distinguish it from the other Ukrainian Relevant Loans: \n156.1  Different loan “purpose”: In the Prominmet  Loan Agreement, the purpose of \nthe loan is “Replenishment of turnover funds ” {F1/34/8} . All other Ukrainian \nRelevant Loan Agreements state “ financing of the company’s current activities ”.  \n156.2  D ifferent type of credit facility : The Prominmet Loan is a non- revolving credit \nfacility {F1/34/8} . All other Ukrainian Relevant Loans are revolving.  \n156.3  D ifferent security : The Prominmet Loan is secured by a pledge of rights under \n(non- relevant) supply agreements and a guarantee {E2/120} . The other \n \n31  These transactions are listed as using part-Exact Matching and part -Bridging Loan Methodology by Mr \nThompson at Thompson 4/Appendix 5 -3-1 {D1/512} “RDDs”, Column C (“Combined Funds Flow \nMethodology and Bridging Methodology”).  \n32  D2 accepts he has an 8.96% indirect interest (held on bare trust) in Prominmet { A2/37 }. \nAA4/6/47\n44 \n Ukrainian Relevant Loans are secured only by pledges. It was the only \nUkrainian Relevant Loan (save for Vegatorg) not secured by a LFSA Pledge or RSA Pledge: POC/Sch 1 {A1/ 3/1}. The Bank notes it is the “ single exception ” \nto the Relevant Loans describing the collateral to be provided by the Borrowers \nas simply a “ pledge agreement ”: Bank Opening/200 {AA2/1/92}  \n157. Thirdly , there is no RSA with Prominmet (Bank Opening/fn.166 {AA2/1/94}) and it \ndid not form part of the “currency scheme”. It did not feature in the Kazantsev or \nGurieva Spreadsheets, was not included in the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings and was \nnot one of the 42 Borrowers33 featured in the NashiGroshi article {E7/276.1} .  \n158. Fourthly , and perhaps most importantly, a  coherent application of the Bank’s \nMethodology would not link the Prominmet Relevant Drawdown to the relevant \n‘Unreturned’ Prepayment from Foxar  to Collyer {D1/196}.  \n159. Mr Steadman explains this at Steadman3/2.2 {D3/13 .1/7-9}. It uses Exact Matching \nto trace f unds from Prominmet to Viglon to Foxar  to Spircom. It  then switches  to use \nSupply Agreement reference matching to continue following the money from Spircom to Foxar  onwards . This ignores the fact  that the payment from Prominmet to Viglon \nidentifies itself as a prepayment under a supply agreement and there is no return of prepayment , as Mr Thompson accepted {Day24/94:19} -95:1. That is to say, the \nProminmet payment to Viglon is on the Bank’s Methodology an “unreturned \nprepayment” and the diagram should have stopped at Viglon. Mr Thompson attempts \nto say that “ because there is no corresponding return of prepayment…the Bank’s case uses Exact \nMatching and FIFO to link the Relevant Drawdown made by Prominmet…to Viglon…and \nultimately to Foxar ” (Thompson5/3.6) {D1/515/10 }. This is incoherent. Outside the \n“outliers”, the  Bank does not permit the use of Exact Matching to trace onwards from \na prepayment where there is no matching return.  \n160. In his repo"}

This is incoherent. Outside the \n“outliers”, the  Bank does not permit the use of Exact Matching to trace onwards from \na prepayment where there is no matching return.  \n160. In his report, Mr Thompson sought to justify using Exact Matching ( and ignoring \nsupply agreement references) by saying that ( i) there are no other payments in Viglon’s \ncurrent account between receipt of funds from Prominmet and payment to Foxar; ( ii) \nthere are no other payments totalling UAH157m in Foxar’s current account with which to exact match it; and ( iii) therefore there is no other way in which the first \nprepayment from Foxar to Spircom could have been funded (Thompson5/3.8 -3.9) \n \n33 There are 47 Ukrainian Borrowers in total.  \nAA4/6/48\n45 \n {D1/515/11}. He added in XX that “ if you work back from the unreturned prepayment, then \nyou reach the relevant drawdown identified by the Bank and there is no other drawdown that could \nfund it ” {Day24/95:7- 10}. However, he accepted that, tracing forwards  from \nProminmet, on the Bank’s Methodology one would not trace beyond Viglon \n{Day24/95:18- 20}. He had previously maintained that the Bank’s Methodology did \nnot rely solely on working backwards from the Unreturned Prepayment {Day23/12:1 -\n7} {Day23/21:21 -23} {D ay23/25:24} - 26:3.  \n161. These supposed justifications in fact highlight why the Bank’s Methodology is flawed \nand why Exact Matching should be used. Examples of other RDDs  can be used to \ndemonstrate this:   \nExample 1 – Dorteks  (Type 1) :  \nOn the Bank’s Methodology, Dorteks  RDDs  are followed to  a prepayment to \nCollyer  but no further as there is no return payment from Collyer to Dorteks \nwith a matching supply agreement reference {D1/ 32}. Exact Matching by \ncontrast traces the money on from Collyer to Gardera and Amadoras, who use \nthe money to repay loans { D2/9/34} :  \nExtracts from Collyer’s accounts f or the relevant time period  {D2/9/39 }34 \nshow : \n1. There are no other payments in Collyer’s account between receipt of \nfunds from Dorteks and the transfers to Amadoras and Gardera.  \n2. There are no other payments totalling USD33m with which to Exact \nMatch either payment  on to Amadoras or Gardera .  \n3. There is no other way (i.e. except for the payment from Dorteks) in \nwhich the payments from Collyer to Amadoras  and Gardera could have \nbeen funded. A part from the Dorteks payment there was not enough \nmoney in Collyer’s  account.  \nSo, applying Mr Thompson’s own justifications for using Exact Matching in the \ncase of Prominmet, Exact Matching should also be used here to trace the funds \nonwards from Collyer.  \nWhen asked in XX why he  did not apply the same Exact Matching approach to \ntrace funds on from Collyer (in the case of Dorteks) as he had to trace funds on from Viglon (in the case of Prominmet), he could not answer: “ I think ultimately \nthis is a matter for your Lordship to decide on. This example does work in a slightly different \nway.” {Day24/96:15} -97:8. \nExample 2 – Tamersa  (Type 2) :  \nOn the Bank’s Methodology  Tamersa  RDDs  are traced directly to a prepayment \nto Kalten, but are then linked using supply agreement references  ultimately to  an \n‘Unreturned’  Prepayment to Trade Point Agro . The  funds are followed no \nfurther  as there is no return payment with a matching supply agreement reference \n \n34  Where Mr Davidson’s Appendix 8 sets out “ Transactions by Account”, data is provided for two days prior \nto the commencement of the transaction chain until 2 days following the conclusion of the transaction chain, with the transactions linked by Exact Matching highlighted {D2/7/2} ¶3(d).  \nAA4/6/49\n46 \n {D1/ 74}.

Exact Matching traces the Tamersa RDDs  to Kalten then straight back \nto Tamersa and Rapit, who use it to make repayments to the Bank. The RDDs  \nnever reach Trade Point Agro  {D2/9/530 }. \nExtracts from Kalten’s accounts f or the time around the RDDs  {D2/9/534-\n538} show : \n1. There are some payments in Kalten’s account between the receipt of \nfunds from the Tamersa  RDDs  and the transfers from Kalten to \nTamersa and Rapit. However, these are all small.  \n2. There are no other payments totalling USD52m with which to Exact Match the payments out to Tamersa and Rapit.  \n3. There is no other way the payments from Kalten to Tamersa  and Rapit \ncould have been funded. But for the USD52m Tamersa RDDs  there was \nnot enough money in Kalten’s account.  \nApplying Mr Thompson’s own justifications for using Exact Matching in the case \nof Prominmet here, Exact Matching should have been used to trace the funds \nfrom Kalten straight back to Tamersa and Rapit, with the Tamersa RDDs  never \nlinked to the ‘Unreturned’ Prepayment to Trade Point Agro.  \n162. Finally , the Prominmet  Relevant  Loan was treated differently in relation to default . It \nwas not repaid (unlike all other Relevant Loans, save Tamersa), so there was no \nrecycling by way of Intermediary Loans and it was not included in the Restructuring \nor Transformation. Rather, the Bank considered writing it off or taking enforcement \nmeasures: see e.g. discussions within the C redit Expert Division in 2016 (noting there \nwas “ eternal  non-repayment ” and “ we recognised it as hopeless ”, and suggesting the Bank \n“commence some formal procedures ”) {K6/93.1/7} { K6/95.1/4-6} ; a document of 20.9.16 \ninitiated by the Department of Credit Analyse s requesting that Mr Yatsenko agree to \nwrite -off Prominmet fines and penalties and refuse to extend the loan term {E15/216} ; \nand a spreadsheet of 1.1.17 entitled “ Problem assets of PrivatBank” suggesting there will \nbe enforcement against Prominmet ( Planned…Detection of movable property for the purpose \nof seizure. Estimated date 24/07/2017”) {E17/100/103} . \n(3) Consequences for the Bank’s case  \n163. Limitation aside, t he Bank cannot rely upon many features in relation to the Cypriot \nBorrowers or Prominmet that it relies upon relation to other Relevant Loans to infer the existence of a fraud e.g. , entry into a RSA or repayment by “sham” Intermediary \nLoans. Further, the Bank has also had to formulate a separate loss case in relation to Prominmet and the Cypriot Borrowers: RRFI of 28.9.20, ¶21- 23 {A2/16/16 -19}. \n164. The Bank makes much of the Prominmet  RDDs  as, using Exact Matching, the y can \nultimately be partially traced to a USD 0.653m payment to Mr Bogolyubov’s  current \naccount . However, this gives no support to the Bank’s wider case and nothing can be \nextrapolated from it in terms of Mr Bogolyubov’s involvement in the ‘Scheme’ . As \nAA4/6/50\n47 \n explained above , Prominmet does not fit into the Bank’s ‘Scheme’ at all: it is an outlier. \nFurther, as explained below ( Section  B5(3)), the funds are traced to this payment only \nif Exact Matching  is used . On the Bank’s  case, using the Bank’s Methodology, the \nfunds do not go to Mr Bogolyubov at all.   \n165. These Borrowers do not fit into the Bank’s case , the claims are time barred and the \nclaims in respect of them should be dismissed. \nB4. REPAYMENT  \n166.

These Borrowers do not fit into the Bank’s case , the claims are time barred and the \nclaims in respect of them should be dismissed. \nB4. REPAYMENT  \n166. As explained in Section  C5(3) below , the Bank’s case that the music ‘stopped’ on \n1.9.14 and that everything thereafter  was a ‘cover -up’ is unsustainable. After this point, \nthe recycling continued , with Intermediary Drawdowns treated by Bank employees \nindistinguishably from Relevant  Drawdown s and some attempts to continue the \nrecycling scheme apparently stymied by the NBU’s refusal to permit currency \nexchange transactions : see further D2 Opening/Section B2 {AA4/1/15}. The experts \nagree that  c.USD1.1bn of RDDs  were directly repaid in cash (mostly by Intermediary \nDrawdowns) {D1/521P /5} (App. 4 -2-3) with the remainder repaid by Asset Transfer \nand Transformation. \n167. There is no substantive difference between the RDDs  and Intermediary Drawdowns \nin terms of the actual flow of money vis -à-vis the Bank. The only difference is that the \nRDDs  are funnelled into the currency loan scheme with supply agreement and \nprepayment references attached to them.  Many  Intermediary Drawdowns were from \nRelevant Loans {D1/270P}  (column E)  and many Intermediary Borrowers (e.g. \nAmadoras and Gardera) featured on the Kazantsev Spreadsheet  {E7/39P} , showing \nthey were  part of the recycling scheme . \n168. The Bank’s attempt to treat the RDDs  as 270 in stances of theft of actual money from \nthe Bank’s vaults and at the same time treat the repayments merely as ledger entries is untenable. \nB5. M\nR BOGOLYUBOV DID NOT BENEFIT FROM THE ‘SCHEME ’  \n169. In what was meant to be its documentary presentation against D1  and in XX of the \nforensic accounting experts , the Bank developed its case – in some respects in \ncompletely new ways - on how it says Mr Bogolyubov benefitted from the ‘Scheme’. \n170. The ways in which the Bank says Mr Bogolyubov benefitted from the ‘Scheme’ are \ninconsistent with its  own case. In its examples  of supposed benefit, money could not \nAA4/6/51\n48 \n have both gone to Mr Bogolyubov’s benefit and  have funded the  URPPs . The \nexamples ignore the Bank’s Methodology for linking RDDs  to URPPs . Some even rely  \non the Lafferty Spreadsheets , despite the Bank’s pleaded case that they  are inaccurate \n(Reply/35.3) {A1/25/66}35 and its description of  them  as “notorious, thoroughly discredited \nand now abandoned” (Bank Opening/6(3)) {AA2/1/13}, saying that “ the purported analysis \nset out in Lafferty Spreadsheets was, as the Bank has maintained throughout, fatally flawed in \nmultiple respects ” and that they “(i) do not follow, or even purport to follow, a consistent methodology \nor approach; (ii) contain numerous significant inaccuracies and inconsistencies; and (iii) contain \nsignificant omissions.”: Bank Opening/559 {AA2/1/218} . One supposed example in the \nBank’s Closing does not relate to Relevant Loans at all, dating to 2010: Bank \nClosing/302(1) -(2) {AA2/15/170}. \n171. This is a complete answer  to the Bank’s arguments . It cannot on the one hand rely \nupon the Bank’s Methodology to say that the RDDs  funded URPPs  and on the other \nrely upon inconsistent methodologies which the Bank rejects in other contexts  to say \nthat they  went to a different destination supposedly to benefit Mr Bogolyubov.  \n172. In any event, w hatever methodology is used, the Bank’s examples do not in fact show \nany funds going to Mr Bogolyubov or to his benefit, save for the USD0.653m payment  \ntraced  from Prominmet which, as explained above, is an outlier . They show no “ theft”. \nThe Bank emphasised in its opening arguments that its claim is  that D1 and Mr \nBogolyubov “ stole money from the Bank” .

It expressly disclaimed a claim in respect of loss \ncaused by bad loans {Day2/61:9} - 62:6. \n(1) Ferroalloy traders  in the Lafferty Spreadsheets  \n173. First, t he Bank claims that  the Lafferty Spreadsheets show RDDs  from 11 Borrowers \nbeing ultimately used for repayment by the ferroalloy holding companies {D1/281.1}: “the scheme, as described in those Lafferty Spreadsheets, purportedly demonstrated that about $452 \nmillion went to the first and second defendants' companies, primarily the ferroalloy holding companies .” \n{Day13/27:23} -28:4,  {Day13/55: 10-19}. There are numerous flaws in the Bank’s \nargument and it cannot show that funds in its ‘Scheme’ went to Mr Bogolyubov’s \nbenefit in this way.  \n \n35  The Bank initially pleaded, in response to D1 and D2’s case on the use of funds based on the Lafferty \nSpreadsheet analysis that “ The Bank denies the Defendants’ factual case as to the use of the funds drawn down under \nthe Relevant Loans (D1/¶¶57 -58; D2/¶¶5(4), 15(4)(c), 67(6)). This adopts the analysis of Mr Lafferty as set out in \nhis Third and Fourth Witness Statements. That analys is is flawed… ” {A1/25/66} \nAA4/6/52\n49 \n 174. The Bank extended this argument in closing, saying that the Lafferty Spreadsheets also \nshow payments being received by 55 companies featuring in D1 -2’s asset disclosure : \nBank Closing/309- 310 {AA2/15/174} . It is too late for the Bank to make this new \nargument and it is unclear whether the Bank says any funds were received by these \ncompanies, as opposed to them merely appearing in payment chains . The short answer \nis that reliance upon the Lafferty Spreadsheets is incoherent.   \n(i) Incoherent reliance upon Lafferty Spreadsheets  \n175. As explained above, the Bank has rejected the Lafferty analysis as inaccurate. Further, \nfor the transaction chains comprising the USD452m supposedly going to these companies, the Lafferty Spreadsheets use the ‘break point ’ and ‘compensation \npayment’  analysis  {D1/281.1} {Day13/55:13 -16}, which is  a focus of particular \ncriticism by the Bank : e.g. Bank Opening/558  {AA2/1/218} , Thompson1/5.49 -5.55 \n{D1/1/169}. Most egregiously, in order to seek to link different payments to Grizal \n(and thus Mr Bogolyubov), the Bank relies upon what the Lafferty Spreadsheets show only before  the break point, on the basis that “ nobody likes break points anymore ” \n{Day25/88:13- 14}: see below Section  B5(4). \n176. N ot only has the Bank disavowed the Lafferty  analysis, but it is inconsistent with the \nBank’s own methodology for following funds . Two examples are given below and the \nsame holds true for all of the transactions chains  at {D1/281.1}. \n177. E xample 1 - Agroprom: the Bank relies upon the Lafferty Spreadsheets as showing \nthat Agroprom RDDs  (made on various dates in May 14) went via Collyer and various \nother companies to MGOK and OGOK  which used them to make repayments to the \nBank on the same dates as the RDDs  {H2/8.1/1 -2}. On the Bank’s Methodology, the \nAgroprom RDDs  went  initially to Collyer in May 14, but we re then  returned in Aug \n14 to Agroprom before being paid out again to Collyer as a URPP  {D1/30}.  \n178. Example 2 – Mastein : the Bank relies upon the Lafferty Spreadsheets as showing \nthat Mastein RDDs  (made on various dates in May and Jul 14) went via Collyer and \nvarious other companies before being used on the same dates by  OGOK, MGOK, \nZFZ, NZF and SFZ to make repayments to the Bank {H2/20.1/49}  {H2/8.1/85} . \nOn the Bank’s Methodology , the Mastein RDDs  went  initially to Collyer, but were \nth"}
{"start": 147000, "text": "turned in Aug \n14 to Agroprom before being paid out again to Collyer as a URPP  {D1/30}.  \n178. Example 2 – Mastein : the Bank relies upon the Lafferty Spreadsheets as showing \nthat Mastein RDDs  (made on various dates in May and Jul 14) went via Collyer and \nvarious other companies before being used on the same dates by  OGOK, MGOK, \nZFZ, NZF and SFZ to make repayments to the Bank {H2/20.1/49}  {H2/8.1/85} . \nOn the Bank’s Methodology , the Mastein RDDs  went  initially to Collyer, but were \nthen returned in Aug 14  to Mastein before then being paid out again to Collyer  as a \nURPP {D1/96} .  \nAA4/6/53\n50 \n 179. The two analyses are mutually exclusive. Obviously, the funds could not be used both \nto repay loans by the ferroalloy companies in May -Jul 14 and also  to make URPPs  in \nAug 14. The Bank must choose a single case.  \n(ii) M r Bogolyubov’s interests in the relevant companies \n180. Moreover, the Bank ’s claims that the money “ went to the first and second defendants' \ncompanies ” rely upon an inaccurate summary of  their interests {AA6/18}. I t has \nincorrectly stated that Mr Bogolyubov is interested in one company and blurred the \npicture by combining D1 and Mr Bogolyubov’s respective holdings.  \nCompany  Bank’s claim as to D1 \nand D2 “ Combined % \ninterest ” {AA6/18}  D2’s interest as disclosed in \nJune 2019 asset disclosure \n{J4/5}  \nAspect Oil LLC  50% (D2 only)36 No interest  \nPJSC Dniproazot  32.86%  16.43% interest {J4/5/139}  \nMarganetskiy Mining and \nProcessing Plant \nLLC/MGOK  47.84%  23.92% {J4/5/144}  \nNikopol Ferroalloy \nPlant/NZF  49.79%  24.79% {J4/5/147}  \nOrdzhonikidze Mining and \nProcessing Plant \nLLC/OGOK  48.6%  24.3% {J4/5/144}  \nStakhanovsky Ferroalloy \nPlant/SZF  48.98%  24.49% {J4/5/146}  \nPJSC Ukrtatnafta  13.6%  7.1052% {J4/5/2}  \nZaporozhye Ferroalloy \nPlant/ZZF  22.04%  10.3% {J4/5/145}  \nCornesia Consulting Ltd  Cornesia holds assets in \nwhich D1 -2 have \ndisclosed interests  No interest  \n \n36  The Bank erroneously conflates two different companies – “ Aspect Oil LLC” which is the company \nmentioned in the Lafferty Spreadsheet (with company code 37236900) and in which D2 has not \nadmitted any interest and “LLC Aspect ” in which D2 has admitted a 50% interest {J4/5/159} . (See e.g. \n{E12/316P/3} lines 161-162 which lists both companies and the Rokoman Spreadsheet at {E10/265P}  \np.35, line 1230 (Aspekt LLC) and p.45, line 1754 (Aspekt Oil LLC).)  \nAA4/6/54\n51 \n (iii) Kazantsev Spreadsheets  \n181. The Bank claims that the  Lafferty  Spreadsheet  analysis fits with the Kazantsev \nSpreadsheet, which attributes payments made by these 11 Borrowers to “ repayment of \nindustrialists’ debts ” {E7/39P/14}  (table at the bottom of the page, blue section) .  \n182. However, as explained above, and as the Bank accepts, the Kazantsev Spreadsheet \nrecords recycling transactions. The inclusion of the RDDs  by these 11 Borrowers in \nthe spreadsheet therefore suggests that they formed part of the recycling scheme  \n(further supported by the fact that the loans by the 11 Borrowers went on to be \nrecycled through repayment) . Other companies in which Mr Bogolyubov had an \ninterest were used within the recycling scheme without any net benefit to those \ncompanies: examples of Uniks and Olbia are given below.  \n183. Further, all companies featuring in the Kazantsev Spreadsheet were allocated an \nindustry. This does not mean that the funds ultimately go to the benefit of that \nindustry . It was a label used for the purpose of recycling. Again, an example is Uniks, \nallocated the industry “ construction ” on the Kazantsev Spreadsheet matching  the \nindustries of the borrowers it replaces, Real -Standart and Forsa. The Bank itself says \nthat Uniks ’ allocated project was a fiction {Day1/98:5} - 99:10.   \n(iv) Contemporaneous emails.  \n184.

The Bank itself says \nthat Uniks ’ allocated project was a fiction {Day1/98:5} - 99:10.   \n(iv) Contemporaneous emails.  \n184. The Bank attempted to bolster its analysis by referring to emails about the financing of ferroalloy holdings {Day17/65:4} -72:11 . It referred to three emails:  \n184.1  An email from Ms Chmona to Mr Dubilet of 14.10.13 asking him to issue a total loan of USD38m “ in order to finance the cash gap, and fulfil the payment obligations \nof the enterprises of ferroalloy holdigna [sic] (NFP, SZF, ZZF, OGOK, MGOK, TGOK) \nfrom October 14 to 25, 2013 ” and setting out what the lending would be used for \n{E2/151} . It is unclear how this is said to be relevant where the first Relevant \nDrawdown relied upon as funding the ferroalloy companies was on 26.2.14  \n{D1/281.1}.  \n184.2  An email from Mr Medvedev to Mr Novikov of 14.4.15 stating that Alfatrader, \nVinibur, Letara and Milorin should be added to the related parties lists as “ the \ncompanies are involved in the financing of PJSC Zaporhozhsky Ferroalloy Plant ” \n{E8/230.1} . The Bank says it would have “ put to Mr Medvedev that this is clear \ncontemporaneous confirmation that the fraudulent drawdowns to these four were intended to \nAA4/6/55\n52 \n finance this ferroalloy plant of the first and second defendants ” {Day17/68:20- 25} and \nsuggests that the genesis of this is Ms Chmona’s email to Mr Dubilet above \n{Day17/70:17- 19}. However, t his is more likely  an example of a project label \nbeing allocated to lending as described above.  \n184.3  An email from Mr Yatsenko of 15.6.16  (well after the last Relevant Drawdown ) \nwhich makes reference to “ ferrotraders” {E14/194} {E14/195} . The Bank does \nnot explain what it says should be drawn from this email but says it “ would have \nasked Mr Yatsenko…to explain what he meant under “ferrotraders” by “ferrotrader loans ” \n{Day17/66:9- 11}. On its face, the email says nothing.  \n185. None of these emails assist the Bank with whether Mr Bogolyubov benefitted from \nwhat the Bank says is the ‘S cheme ’. Further, t here is no issue that the Bank may in fact \nhave lent money to D1 and Mr Bogolyubov’s businesses  and the Bank makes no claim \nthat it has suffered a loss from such loans . The two issues cannot be conflated. \nMoreover, there is no evidence of Mr Bogolyubov having any involvement in or \nknowledge of the RDDs  being used in this way .  \n(2) RDDs  traced by Exact Matching to ZFZ repayments  \n186. The Bank also relies upon RDDs  by Milorin and Prado being traced by Exact \nMatching to repayments by ZFZ {D1/347/61 -64} {D2/9.1/167} {Day13/62:1 3} -\n63:19. The Bank claims this shows “ theft, money laundering, benefit ” {Day26/41:15} -43:16 \n{Day26/44:1 -5}. Again, the Bank cannot rely upon this. I t is not the Bank’s case that \nthe Prado or Milorin  RDDs  go to ZFZ  at all ; it says  they fund URPPs  to Collyer \n{D1/34}37 {D1/70/2} .38 \n187. Further, even the Exact Matching analysis does not show that these  Relevant \nDrawdown were ‘stolen ’, but rather  that one loan was repaid by another . The Bank \ndoes not claim that it has suffered a loss by  a ‘good’  loan being replaced by a ‘ bad’ loan \nand it has provided no evidence that this is what occurred. As shown in detail  in \nrelation to Uniks, there are other examples of operating (or once -operating) companies \nbeing used as pawns in the recycling scheme : Section E .  \n \n37  In the Prado diagram, the UAH RDDs shown on Exact Matching as going to ZFZ are encompassed in \nthe UAH104.7m transfer shown as occurring between 3.4.14 -7.4.14 {D1/35}.  \n38  In the Milorin diagram, the UAH RDDs shown on Exact Matching as going to ZFZ are encompassed \nin the UAH120.8m transfer shown as occurring between 7.4.14 -11.4.14 {D1/71}.  \nAA4/6/56\n53 \n (3) Prominmet funds traced by Exact Matc"}

The Bank also relies upon Exact Matching as showing that the Prominmet Relevant \nDrawdown ultimately funded a payment of USD0.653m to Mr Bogolyubov via Grizal  \n{Day13/62:1 3} -67:4 {D1/347/65- 66}.  \n189. Again, the Bank’s reliance upon this is inconsistent with its  case.  The funds could not \nboth go from Spircom via various other companies to Grizal and then to Mr \nBogolyubov in Feb -Mar 14 {D1/347/66}  (on Exact Matching), but also  go from \nSpircom to Foxar  to Collyer  to Foxar  and ultimately an ‘Unreturned’ Prepayment to \nCollyer in  May -Aug 14 {D1/196} (on the Bank’s Methodology). \n190. At any rate, the sum traced to Mr Bogolyubov ’s account on this methodology \n(USD0.653m ) is de minimis in the context of the alleged scheme , Prominmet is an \n‘outlier’ and  does not fit into the ‘Scheme’, and, as Mr Steadman explained, the \ncircumstances of the transfer would need to be examined to determine if there had \nbeen any ‘Misappropriation’ {Day26/30:8- 12}. Accordingly, nothing can be \nextrapolated from this in terms of the ‘Scheme’ or Mr Bogolyubov’s involvement .  \n(4) Funds traced by Lafferty Spreadsheets to Divot  \n191. In its XX of Mr Davidson, the Bank put another new example of supposed benefit, \nagain reliant upon the Lafferty Spreadsheets. It claimed that the Lafferty Spreadsheets permit the tracing of  a Tekhspets Relevant Drawdown  to Divot, before reaching a \n‘break point’ at which point the Bank made the unprincipled assertion (inconsistently \nwith its position on the ferroalloy traders) that the remainder of the transaction chain could be ignored as “ no one likes break points anymore ” {D1/1/197} {Day25/87:21} -\n88:18. It then relied upon the simple  existen ce of payments between Divot and Grizal \nin 2013- 2016 {K7-D/1P}  for the conclusion that “ although we can't engage in exact \nmatching, what we can say is that proceeds from the RDDs  went to a company which itself was funding \none of the second defendant's companies? ” {Day25/89:1 -4}. This argument was pursued at  \nBank Closing/300 {AA2/15/167} .  \n192. This argument is  fundamentally flawed,  as it is based on the false premis e that the piece \nof Lafferty Spreadsheet tracing relied upon concerned  a Relevant  Drawdown.  It did \nnot. The payment relied upon by the Bank is a USD30m drawdown made by \nAA4/6/57\n54 \n Tekhspets on 14.8.13 {D1/1/197}. The first Tekhspets RDD was on 6.11.13 : \nThompson1/Appendix 3-3-8 ( #304- #311) { D1/107 }.39  \n193. Moreover, the Bank failed to draw to Mr Davidson or the Court’s attention to the fact  \nthat the ledger of payments between Divot and Grizal upon which it relied {K7 -D/1P}  \nshows no payments which could be related to this (non- Relevant) Tekhspets \ndrawdown. Tekhspets made this drawdown on 14.8.13 and the Lafferty  Spreadsheets \nsuggest the funds went  on to Prior then Divot the same day . There are no payments \nsimilar in time or amount  in Grizal’s ledger . The extract of  payments between Divot \nand Grizal shows no payments at all  in Aug  13. The first payment from Divot after \nthis is a payment of USD8.5m  on 4.9.13. There are then no payments from Divot to \nGrizal until Mar 14.  \n194. I n fact, save for the Prominmet example above, Grizal is not involved in any of the \ntransaction chains compiled by the experts by way of Exact Matching or the Bank’s \nMethodology.

The Bank also claimed for the first time in its oral submissions that Mr Bogolyubov \nbenefitted by virtue of RDDs  being used to fund construction projects by Hotel Split, \nShah Palace and PJSC Kievguma. See also Bank Closing/301 {AA2/15/168}.  \n196. These arguments do not hold as explained below. A s with the ferroalloys they are also \ninconsistent with the Bank’s case that the same RDDs  were used to fund URPPs . \nContemporaneous evidence linking Relevant Loans to these projects is consistent \nsimply with the projects being used as labels within the recycling scheme.  \n(i) Hotel Split  \n197. Hotel Split is a 4* hotel operated by Radisson Blu. Hotel Split D.D. (which owned the \nhotel) was majority owned as to c.86 % by Memento DOO. Memento was in turn \nowned by Olbia Investment Ltd, which also held a small direct stake (c.9% in the \n \n39  It is therefore unnecessary to delve into the usual flaws in the Bank’s argument that it is inconsistent \nwith the Bank’s case that the Tekhspets Relevant Drawdown funded an ‘Unreturned’ Prepayment to \nCollyer, never going to Divot at all {D1/14}  and with Exact Matching which shows the Tekhspets \nRelevant Drawdown being recycled to repay a Tekhspets loan {D2/9/566} . Mr Davidson did not, as \nthe Bank claims, accept that the data shows that the Tekhspets Relevant Drawdown went to Divot: \nBank Closing/300 {AA2/15/167} . \nAA4/6/58\n55 \n hotel). The balance was owned by CERP and other small shareholders {E17/148.1.2} \n{D8/18/3} .  \n198. Radisson Blu managed the hotel {K2 -J/22/18} , e.g. in at least 2013, Radisson paid for \nHotel Split D.D. to be audited and contributed 50% of the cost of Memento’s audit \n{E3/316/2} . Both companies  were audited by Grant Thornton in 2013 and Memento \nwas audited by PwC in 2014 -2016 {K2 -I/18} {K2 -I/33} {K2- I/42} .  \n199. The Bank argues that Ribotto and Ortika were used to misappropriate money from \nthe Bank to finance Hotel Split, via RDDs  totalling USD 100m made in Jan -Feb 14 \n{Day17/64:17} - 65:3, {Day13/97: 10} -98:4. It relies upon:  \n199.1  Emails and Skypes  between Bank employees  ascribing the “ project ” label of \nHotel Split to loans to Ortika and Ribotto and suggesting that the latter \nprovided financing to Hotel Split  {E2/223} {E3/10}  {E8/181.1}  \n{Day13/94:1 4} -98:9 {Day17/54:13} - 58:1 {E10/157.06/2} .  \n199.2  The Lafferty Spreadsheets, which the Bank says show Ribotto and Ortika RDDs  going to Olbia (which owned 95% of Hotel Split through Memento \nLtd) and Grandos (which lent money to Hotel Split) {Day17/58:10} - 65:3.  \n199.3  An email from Mr Yatsenko email of 15.6.16 {E14/194}  which refers in the \nattachment {E14/195/3}  to the “ Split borrowers group ” {Day17/66:12- 18} \n199.4  Olbia’s financial statements for y/e 2014 which contain at p.10 “ proceeds from \nborrowings ” of USD149,999,000 {K2 -I/32/10} {Day17/61:13} -62:12. The \nBank says this matched the amount in Mr Yatsenko’s email  (which cannot be \ncorrect as the email contains no figures) . The financial statement also includes \non the same page “ loans granted ” of USD149,999,000, which as the Bank says \n“looks as if it’s a loan in and loan out ” {K2 -I/32/10} .   \n200. As usual, this is inconsistent with the Bank’s own case on how the se RDDs  were used. \nThe Bank’s Methodology shows the RDDs  going from Ribotto/Ortika to Wolcott in \nJan/Feb 14, being returned from Wolcott to Ribotto/Ortika in Apr/May 14, before \nbeing loo"}

As usual, this is inconsistent with the Bank’s own case on how the se RDDs  were used. \nThe Bank’s Methodology shows the RDDs  going from Ribotto/Ortika to Wolcott in \nJan/Feb 14, being returned from Wolcott to Ribotto/Ortika in Apr/May 14, before \nbeing looped between Teamtrend and Ribotto/Ortika and ultimately going out to \nTeamtrend as URPPs  in Jul/Aug 14 {D1/92} {D1/94} . On this analysis the funds \nnever go from Wolcott to Olbia or Grandos at all.  \n201. It is also inconsistent with what the Ribotto and Ortika RDDs  are shown to have \nfunded using Exact Matching (which the experts agree shows the actual use of the \nAA4/6/59\n56 \n money). All USD100m of these drawdowns have been traced to repayments by other \nBorrowers : see the Exact Matching diagrams {D2/9.1/3} {D2/9.1/66} \n{D2/9.1/204} {D2/9.1/258} {D2/9/158} {D2/9/320}  and the summary of \nsupporting contemporaneous evidence  at D2 Opening/Schedule 2 {AA4/3/7 -14}. \n202. There is further evidence  inconsistent with the funds being siphoned to Hotel Split:  \n202.1  The Bank gave an incomplete picture of what the Lafferty Spreadsheets  show , \nfocusing only on the mentions of Olbia and Grandos. It  did not draw attention \nto the fact that the Lafferty Spreadsheets do not show the money stopping at \nOlbia or Grandos but continuing through a number of other entities before \nbeing used to repay debts of other borrowers : see {H2/8.1/143- 154} (Ribotto) \nand {H2/8.1/107- 114} (Ortika). The Lafferty Spreadsheets are therefore \ninconsistent  with the funds being used to finance Hotel Spl it (to construct  a \n“swimming pool ” {Day13/97: 6} or otherwise). \n202.2  This is consistent with Olbia’s 2014 financial statements {K2 -I/32/10} , which \nshow that loans in and out netted out . Olbia’s bank account statements for \n2014 show the USD 149.999m relied upon coming in and going out a few days \nlater {E17/243.03.03} . This is consistent with Olbia just being used as a \nfungible company in the recycling scheme.  \n202.3  Neither the Lafferty Spreadsheet s nor the transactional data show the funds \ngoing to Hotel Split D.D.  or Memento (i.e. the companies that actually owned \nthe hotel) . Rather, the y show the funds going only to Olbia to Grandos before \ngoing out to other companies. Consistently with this, the USD 149.999m relied \nupon by the Bank does not appear in Memento’s accounts {K2 -I/18/26 -29} \n(y/2014) {K2-I/33/26- 28} (y/e 2015) {K2 -I/42/28 -30} (y/e 2016) or Hotel \nSplit dd’s accounts {E10/182.01} (y/e 2014)  {E14/47.1} (y/e 2015).40 \n202.4  Hotel Split in fact appears to have been funded by loans from Sberbank (EUR 23m) and Grovepoint (c.EUR 32m - which purchased an initial loan from \nHypo Alpe Adria Bank): see PwC’s presentation of 24.8.16 {K2 -J/22/19 -20} \nand Memento’s accounts from y/e 2014 {K2 -I/18/26- 29}.  \n \n40  Nor, for completeness, do they appear in the accounts of the other real estate companies owned by \nMemento – Hotel Split Rezidencije Inc {E10/157.02} (y/e 2014) {E14/117.2} (y/e 2015) or Memento \nSpalato Inc {E10/157.01} (y/e 2014) {E14/211.1} (y/e 2015).  \nAA4/6/60\n57 \n 202.5  There is no evidence that Mr Bogolyubov was aware of these RDDs  or their \nsupposed link to Hotel Split. By contrast, he was  included in email discussions \nof lending by Sberbank, Hypo Alpe Adria Bank and Grovepoint to Hotel Split \n(i.e. in discussions about  how Hotel Split was actually  funded) {E1/116} \n{E1/116.1} {E1/266.1} {E15/132.01}. \n203.

The contemporaneous emails and Skypes that appear to link the Ribotto and Ortika loans to Hotel Split can be explained by the fact that project labels were ascribed to borrowing within the recycling scheme matching the collateral allocat ed to the loans. \nIn the case of Ribotto and Ortika (and Prudis) part of that  collateral was a pledge over \nthe shares in Memento {F141/7}. As the Bank itself says, the designation of the \nprojects that the Relevant Loans were said to fund was a “ fiction ” (see e.g. {Day1/98:5} \n-99:10 in relation to Uniks).  It appears these fictional project labels were put in place \nfor audit purposes (see e.g. the discussions in response to NBU requests for information at {K6/57} {K6/61/2} {E7/298} {E7/307.2} ).  \n(ii) Shah Palace  \n204. The Shah Palace is a palace in Odessa owned by Ukrinterinvest {D8/259/3} . Through \nUkrinterinvest, Mr Bogolyubov had a 50% interest in the Shah Palace, the other 50% of which was owned by D1 {E12/216/3} {E14/233P/32} {A1/17/2} . \n205. The Bank relies upon similar evidence to that for Hotel Split  to argue that Intorno \nRDDs  financed the Shah Palace project {Day13/94:1 8} -98:9: \n205.1  Emails  of 10.12.13 and 14.1.14 ascribing the “ project ” label of Shah Palace to \nRelevant lending  {E2/223} {E3/10} , saying these show that Intorno’s \n“drawdowns of 15 million [were] to refund the refurbishment of the Shah Palace ” and that \nit is clear that Mr Bogolyubov has benefitted from these transactions \n{Day13/94:1 2} -98:4. \n205.2  The Lafferty Spreadsheets {H2/8.1/153} , which it says  show the money going \nto fund the Shah Palace, albeit the Bank has not explained how. The Bank may \nbe relying upon the fact that the funds are shown as going to Valenza, a shareholder in Ukrinterinvest.  \n205.3  Ukrinterinvest’s accounts do not show the drawdowns of USD15m {K2 -I/15}  \n(y/e 2014). Valenza’s ledger shows the money coming in and going back out \non the same day {E13/33.01} . \nAA4/6/61\n58 \n 206. Again, th is is inconsistent with the Bank’s case  and deprecation of the Lafferty \nSpreadsheets . On the Bank’s Methodology, the money from the Feb 14 Intorno RDDs  \ngoes to Faberge, return s from Faberge to Intorno in May 14 before going out to \nTeamtrend, looping back in Aug 14 and going out as a URPP  {D1/86}. \n207. The Lafferty Spreadsheets do not even support the Bank’s argument. The Lafferty \nSpreadsheet analysis does not stop with Valenza but shows Valenza paying the money straight on. Consistently, Valenza’s ledger shows the money coming in and going back out on t he same day {E13/33.01} . The Spreadsheets also do not show the funds going \nto Ukrinterinvest. Consistently with this, Ukrinterinvest’s accounts do not show the \ndrawdowns of USD 15m {K2-I/15} (y/e 2014).  \n208. Moreover, Exact Matching  shows that the Intorno RDD of UAH135m made o n \n17.2.14 (equivalent to USD15m)  was in fact transferred through various companies \nbefore being used to repay loans to four other borrowers {D2/9/160 -167}. It could \nnot have been used to fund the Shah Pa lace. \n(iii) PJSC Kievguma  \n209. The Bank relies on {E2/223}  to suggest that D1 and Mr Bogolyubov benefitted from \nthe ‘Scheme ’ by money going to PJSC Kievguma  {Day13/92:12- 19}. Again, this email \nof 10.12.13 shows the “ project ” of PJSC Kievguma being allocated to Forsa  and Real -\nStandart. \n210. Forsa is not a Borrower  so it is unclear how (or if) the Bank says this shows that Mr \nBogolyubov benefitted from the ‘Scheme’. Real -Standart is a Borrower and the sum \nof USD60m stated in the email  matches up in time and amount with two Real -Standart \nRelevant Loans issued on 13.12.13 and 18.12.13. However, on the Bank’s own case, these  RDDs  did not go to PJSC Kievguma {AA4/3/13}. \n211. Such evidence as there is about where the Re"}

However, on the Bank’s own case, these  RDDs  did not go to PJSC Kievguma {AA4/3/13}. \n211. Such evidence as there is about where the Real Standart RDDs  actually went is \ninconsistent with them funding PJSC Kievguma. It shows  that USD10m of the Real-\nStandart RDDs  made on 21.1.14 in fact circled back to repay loans by seven other \nborrowers (Bersol, Diletra, Kalari, Medvin, Univega, Lansel and Bias). This is shown \nboth by Exact Matching  and a contemporaneous spreadsheet: see {AA4/3/14}.   \n(6) Borrowers’ “projects”  \n212. The Bank relies upon “projects” allocated to various Borrowers to say that the RDDs  \nwent to benefit D1 and Mr Bogolyubov’s businesses , relying on  {E7/266} , which \nAA4/6/62\n59 \n refers to “ project group[s][…] to which these entities [Borrowers]  are assigned (PET traders, \nIMRP project, Kievguma project Skorzonera project, etc.”  and states that “ During 2015, all \ncurrency loans of ~$1.8 billion, issued to \"traders\" across all programmes (ferrotraders, tanker project, \nrubber project, PET traders, IMRP traders, aircraft traders, Kievguma traders, Split traders, \nBukovel traders, traders) will go into arrears. ...” In the attachment {E7/267P} , 15 Borrowers \nare allocated an industry e.g.  Empire and Uniks are allocated “ Kievguma project ”, Viitella \nand Salt iz are allocated “ PET trader ”.  \n213. The Bank says this matches with the industry allocation in the Kazantsev and Gurieva Spreadsheet s, which it says “ sets out a series of programmes, all of which are manifestly the first \nand second defendants’ programmes or projects ”, referring to things such as ferrotraders, \nrubber project, oil storage, and “ ISFP project ” {Day17/72:6} -73:12, Bank Closing/303 \n{AA2/15/170} . \n214. The Bank  has provided no evidence of funds actually going to any of these projects \nand once again the argument is inconsistent with its case that RDDs  fund URPPs .  \n215. It is also inconsistent with its argument that project labels allocated to RDDs  are \nfictions to be ignored. It made this argument in relation to Uniks, ( which in the \nattachment at {E7/ 267P } is allocated to the “ Kievguma Project ” and in the Kazantsev \nSpreadsheet to “ construction ”). The Bank says that the “Kievguma project ” was a project to \nbuild the Euroarena: Bank Opening/fn.230 {AA2/1/132}  and that the designation of \nthe Uniks Relevant Loan as being to fund the arena was a “ fiction ”.  \n…The main documents that were found in relation to Uniks are a credit committee \npresentation, a technical and feasibility study and an expert analysis.  […]. The credit \ncommittee presentation is {E4/82.1P}. That's a pdf.  You can see it's dated the 29th.  \nCan I take you to page {E4/82.1P/2}, \"Key Lending Terms\". My Lord will see \n\"Core business\" is said to be: \"Financing the construction of [the] sports comple x in \nKyiv for the EUROBASKET -2015 Championship\" That is obviously, before one \ngoes even any further into this document, a fiction.  Three points. The Skypes that \nwe've been to reveal that PBC hadn't even decided what sector Uniks would be in at \nthe time of the purported date of this document, the 29th.  So it was still \ncontemplating it might be trading manganese ore or PET.  There's nothing about \nfinancing the construction of a sports complex in Kyiv for the EuroBasket 2015 championship. Second point: no document exists to suggest that Uniks ever had \nanything to do with such a project or raising finance f or it.

There's nothing about \nfinancing the construction of a sports complex in Kyiv for the EuroBasket 2015 championship.

Third point: six weeks \nbefore this, on 13 June 2014, the EuroBasket 2015 championship was cancelled and moved out of Ukraine to France and Germany due to political and security issues in \nUkraine.  See {E4/32.1}, where we see the --  we can briefly tu rn that up --  the FIBA \nEurope announcement from six weeks before. So this is a fiction.  …  \n{Day1/98: 4} -99:9 \nAA4/6/63\n60 \n 216. Further, as the Bank recognised in relation to Uniks, BOK and PBC “ collectively decide \nwhat industry sector label to give to D1 and D2’s company Uniks ” initially assigning it to “ general \nwholesale trade ” {Day1/85:1 -3}. \n217. Numerous  other examples show labels being ascribed to lending with no connection \nto its actual purpose and the  labels being treated as fungible:  \n217.1  In a 21.6.13 email, Mr Melnyk tells Ms Gubanova and Mr Plyska “ Please, consider \nTekhspets…as a ferrotrade[r] for 40 m ” {E2/38} . \n217.2  In a 29.7.14 Skype chat relating to Uniks, Mr Martynyuk said “ it is not yet known \nwhat kind of collateral will be on it and to which group of enterprises it will be assigned (ferro, \npet etc.)” {K6/42}  \n217.3  In an email of 28.4.15, Ms Shvetsova told Mr Melnyk that they are undergoing a “very difficult check” by the NBU which had requested “ documents on the pledge of \nMantas , which changed its affiliation and switched from a ferrotrader to PET using \nbackdating ”. {E9/53}  \n218. No weight can therefore  be placed on “ project ” labels to demonstrate where funds are \nin fact going. And the Bank cannot take an inconsistent approach to how it treats \nlabels. T he Bank’s case is that the labelling of funds by way of the RSAs was a sham.  \n219. It is worth noting in passing that the Bank appears to rely here upon the email at {E7/ 266} and its attachment {E7/ 267P } as a continuation of the scheme shown in \nthe Kazantsev Spreadsheet. Yet, this email dates from Jan 15, and shows the \nreplacement of 15 Borrowers by 17 Intermediary Borrowers. It is further evidence (as \nthe Bank seems to accept by relying on it) that no ‘ music stopped’  in Sep 14.  \n(7) Bank’s financial statements showing lending to “project” sectors  \n220. Finally, the Bank relies upon its accounts as showing “ the vast majority of its lending went \nto sectors in which the first and second defendants had large corporate interests…That therefore admits \nof only two possibilities: one, they were lending to their own companies from their own bank, or they \nwere using t heir bank to fund their rivals’ businesses. We say the latter is absurd and the former is \nborne out by the documents. ” {Day15/55:22 } -56:9, Bank Closing/304- 308 \n{AA2/15/172} .  \n221. It relies upon the section of the 2014 financial statements concerning loans and advances to customers, which lists the “ Economic and business sector risk concentrations \nwithin the customer loan portfolio ” {K1/4/36} saying that this shows that risk was \nAA4/6/64\n61 \n concentrated in areas in which D1 and Mr Bogolyubov also had business interests e.g. \noil and ferroalloy trading, air transportation and chemicals.  \n222. It is pure (and rather desperate) speculation by the Bank that all of these loans were to companies in which Mr Bogolyubov had an interest. Further, the Bank has provided \nno evidence tying any of this lending to what it says comprised the ‘Scheme’. In that  \nregard, it is noted that the industry sectors listed in the financial statements do not fully \nmap onto those listed as the allocated industries in the Kazantsev Spreadsheet (which is the Bank says is a record of the scheme) e.g. “ Ski resort, tourism and f ootball clubs ” does \nnot appear on the Kazantsev Spreadsheet."}

This goes nowhere in suggesting that Mr Bogolyubov benefitted from the ‘Scheme’. \n(8) Conclusion  \n224. The Bank has not advanced its case. It cannot rely upon these examples at all given  its \ncase that the RDDs  were ‘extracted’ as URPPs . Moreover, they  do not in fact show \nany benefit to Mr Bogolyubov. T he Bank’s attempt has only highlighted that on its \ncase it has not managed to show that the ‘Scheme’ benefitted Mr Bogolyubov. Even on Exact Matching, the cases where funds flow within the recycling scheme to \ncompanies related to Mr Bogolyubov are  the exception {Day26/17:1} -18:2 . Mr \nSteadman explained that “ I think there's 719 million that's traced directly to the repayment of \nrelevant loans; there's 400 million -odd to intermediate loans. So those examples that we were looking \nat are different to perhaps the vast majority .” {Day26/48:19} -49:1 {D2/11/12}. More \nimportantly, the circumstances of these payments have not been examined . \nC. THE REALITY – LOAN RECYCLING AND FIREFIGHTING  \n225. Rather than evidencing any theft, the picture painted by the evidence is one of a long -\nrunning loan recycling scheme, bolstering the conclusions above that there was no ‘Misappropriation’ by way of the RDDs  or URPPs . Using the Bank’s flawed analogy \nof a vault ( as Mr Steadman explained, there was no real ‘movement’ of money: “ Where \nwe are talking about transfers between accounts in the same bank, in the same jurisdiction, there’s not a money flow, per se. There’s just an adjustment in the ledgers .” {Day26/20:20- 24}), the \nevidence shows that, over a number of years, beginning well before the start date of the Bank’s ‘Scheme’, money was moved around between different shelves of the vaults  \nrepresenting the accounts of notional customers . The RDDs  were simply part of this. \nThey never left the vaults, but were circled around within them, moving to fill spaces \nAA4/6/65\n62 \n left by other drawdowns by way of ‘repayment’. Similarly, other funds within the vault \nmoved to fill the gaps left by the RDDs  by way of ‘repayment’.  \n226. Thus, whilst there may have been some form of ‘Scheme’ (or ‘Schemes’) ongoing, it was not that relied on by the Bank  in its claim . The events during the Relevant Period \nwere instead an attempt to keep the fiction of a performing loan book going, entailing \na mess of action and reaction as the Bank sought to comply with or avoid developing regulations ( Section C2 ). The elements of this broader pattern of behaviour included \n(i) loan recycling  (Section C3 ); (ii) the use of shell companies ( Section C4 ); (iii) the \navoidance of restrictions on foreign currency lending (in turn explaining at least some of the recycling, use of shells and sham documentation e.g.  supply agreements)  \n(Section C 5); and (iv) the avoidance of restrictions on related party lending – in \nparticular limits on lending to particular groups of related parties (in turn explaining \nthe “shuffling” of directors and beneficiaries  of the shells)  (Section C 6). The Bank \nwas in a state of chaos, fighting fires in every corner.  \n227. The origin of this actual ‘Scheme’ is unclear. It may have begun life as a response to \nregulatory change or to cover up a hole in the Bank’s books. There is no evidence on \nthis, it does not form part of the Bank’s case and establishing it is unnecessary to show \nthat the Bank’s theory of a masterminded ‘Scheme’ to carry out a ‘Misappropriation’ via the RDDs  is wrong.

It may have begun life as a response to \nregulatory change or to cover up a hole in the Bank’s books. There is no evidence on \nthis, it does not form part of the Bank’s case and establishing it is unnecessary to show \nthat the Bank’s theory of a masterminded ‘Scheme’ to carry out a ‘Misappropriation’ via the RDDs  is wrong. Moreover, there is no evidence – or basis for inferring - that \nMr Bogolyubov knew of the RDDs , any Prepayments or any decision leading to these  \nbeing ‘Unreturned’. \nC1. E\nVIDENCE OF THIS REALITY  \n228. The Bank asserts that Mr Bogolyubov’s theory of what was in fact going on is \nadvanced “ entirely without any evidence ” {Day1/7:15- 17} and is a “ construct or hypothesis \nwithout any evidence ” {Day1/34:24- 25}. As shown below, this alternative case is the only \none that sits comfortably with the contemporaneous evidence.  \n229. Further, despite its protestations, key elements of Mr Bogolyubov’s alternative explanation accepted  by the Bank, which agrees that:  \n229.1  Bank employees were recycling drawdowns, cycling prepayments and using \nsupply agreements as a way of “ circumventing Ukrainian currency controls ”: Bank \nClosing/277- 278 {AA2/15/155}  (referring to Mr Yatsenko’s evidence in his \nAA4/6/66\n63 \n withdrawn witness statement that “ mock supply agreements ” were used to - in the \nBank’s words - “ evade currency control restrictions ” {B2/4/6}  ¶¶37 -39, 46).  \n229.2  The key individuals involved in administering any ‘Scheme’ were Mr Dubilet, \nMs Gurieva, Mr Novikov, Mr Yatsenko and Mr Kazantsev {Day1/21:24} -\n22:5 {Day1/45:7- 15}. \n229.3  The Bank’s employees were acting “ in blatant violation of normal banking \nprocedures ”, “contrary to all principles of prudent banking ” {Day1/45:10- 15}.  \n229.4  Entities being used by the employees were shell companies {Day1/16:6}  which \nwere treated as “ fungible ” e.g. {Day1/85:1 -8}. \n229.5  Directors and beneficiaries of these shell companies were being “ shuffled ” to \navoid breaching related party credit ratios e.g.  {Day 3/151:5 -6} {Day4/15:21} -\n20:18. \n229.6  The shell companies were managed by Primecap and PBC {Day1/22:6- 17}. \n230. The Bank portrays Mr Bogolyubov’s theory as far more radical than it is, saying his case is that there was a “ fraudulent scheme…even more extensive than the Bank’s pleaded case ” \n{Day1/34:1 7-19}, and of which Mr Dubilet was the “ mastermind ” {Day1/38:18- 21}.  \n231. Mr Bogolyubov does not say that Mr Dubilet was masterminding a scheme to steal money from the Bank. It is the Bank that says Mr Dubilet “ undoubtedly perpetrated the \nfraud” {Day15/25:24} -26:2. Mr Bogolyubov’s explanation of “firefighting” does not \nrequire Mr Dubilet to have been involved in this way. Further, his theory does not \nconflict with his witness statement as the Bank suggests : Bank Closing/13(2) \n{AA2/15/15 }. His evidence was that he knew nothing of any scheme ( e.g. \nBogolyubov4/139) {B2/11/34} . It w ould not have been appropriate for him to make \nsubmissions on the documents as to what was in reality occurring. \n232. The real difference between the Bank’s case and Mr Bogolyubov’s analysis turns on \nwhether Mr Dubilet and others were (in the Bank’s words) “ off on a frolic of their own ” or \nwere extracting money from the Bank through the URPPs  for Mr Bogolyubov’s \nbenefit. It turns on whether it is appropriate to place - on top of the regulatory \navoidance the Bank agrees was happening (and which provides a complete explanation for the acts relied upon) - an overlay of 270 orchestrated thefts car ried out by or on \nbehalf of Mr Bogolyubov. \nAA4/6/67\n64 \n C2.

THE RELEVANT CONTEXT – EVENTS IN UKRAINE  \n233.  Mr Bogolyubov’s opening briefly addressed the Ukrainian context in which the Bank \nemployees’ behaviour should be viewed, including the weak financial controls in place \nand the prevalence of related party lending: D2 Opening/Section C1( 2) {AA4/1/36}. \nIt also traced the development of currency control and related party regulations, to \nwhich their actions responded: Schedules 3 and 4 {AA4/4} {AA4/5}.  \n234. Their behaviour was representative of pervasive issues faced by the Ukrainian banking \nsector. In 2014, Ukraine was experiencing an economic crisis, in large part caused by \nthe annexation of Crimea and the war in the Donbas. In Ms Gontareva’s words, when \nshe arrived at the NBU in mid -2014, “ Ukraine’s banking sector was at the epicenter of what is \ncalled in economic literature the “perfect storm”: a simultaneous banking and currency crisis aggravated \nby external imbalances and an economic recession. ” {E17/313 .1/11}. The sector faced issues \nincluding a high share of problem loans on banks’ balance sheets, outflows of deposits, \ndollarisation of loans and deposits, large scale related party lending and insufficient regulatory capital {E10/70/4} .  \n(1) Economic crisis and weak controls  \n235. In 2014, Ukraine was experiencing a major economic crisis, including sharp large -scale \nexchange rate depreciation, weak and worsening bank and corporate balance sheets, bank deposit withdrawals and capital flight. This resulted in a request for support from \nthe IMF  {E3/169/5} (IMF Apr 14 report) {E4/342/38- 39} (IMF Sep 14 report)  \n{E7/180/32} (NBU 2014 Annual Report). Inflation reached 24.9% at the end of 2014 \n“driven mostly by the sharp exchange rate depreciation and energy price increases ”. Over the course \nof 2014, the UAH los t nearly half of its value and banking systems lost about ¼ of \ntheir deposits {E8/52/9- 11} (IMF Mar 15 report). The problems continued in 2015 \n{E8/52/2} .  \n236. Ms Gontareva and Mr Stepaniuk noted in a report co- authored whilst at the LSE that \nthe “ banking sector in Ukraine had been hard hit by a combination of political, security, and \nexchange -rate pressures since the beginning of 2014 ”, the biggest of which was a run on banks, \nwhich included a slump in foreign currency deposits {E17/313.1/17}. They opined \nthat “ the systemic problems of the banking sector that emerged suddenly in 2014 … were actually \nthe result of accumulated imbalances and ineffective supervisory  policy from several decades .” They \nlisted five “ key characteristics of the banking system ” {E17/313.1/16 -17}: \n• Large fragmentation. The banking system was very fragmented with the 80 \nsmallest banks (out of 180) having less than 5% market share.  \nAA4/6/68\n65 \n • Related -party lending. Lending to the owner's business was the main activity \nfor a large number of banks (a scheme in which the bank was a piece in a value \nchain of the corporate sector).  \n• Non- transparent ownership. The central bank did not know who the real \nowners of banks were due to existing requirements that banks were not forced to show their 15 ultimate beneficial owners and the central bank could only see \nthe names of offshore compani es as bank owners.  \n• Hidden NPLs [Non- Performing Loans]. The pre -2014 banking data testified \nto the inconsistency of the NPL recognition in bank books. A large share of loans, primarily issued to related parties, were acknowledged as performing, \ndespite the fact that new loans  were issued to service the previous loans.  \n• Dollarization of banks' assets and liabilities was nearly 50%.  \n237.

In response, the NBU implemented a policy programme, which included monitoring \nof weak institutions, recapitalisation and liquidity support, corrective measures to prevent misbehaviour of bank managers, reducing related party lending, resolution of \nimpaire d assets, strengthening governance and exchange rate adjustment \n{E4/342/13} (IMF Sep 14 report) {E7/180/32}  (NBU 2014 Annual Report) \n{E8/52/2} {E8/52/11}  (IMF Mar 15 report).  \n238. Two particular problems -  (i) foreign exchange and (ii) related party lending -  are \nconsidered in further detail below.  \n(2) Crisis in the foreign exchange markets  \n239. In the 2008 financial crisis, Ukraine suffered significant devaluation of the UAH, \nwhich problem continued, alongside high dollarisation, through to 2014 when the foreign exchange market was hit even harder by the political and military crisis (see \nabove).  As the Bank explained in its 2013 Prospectus  {E1/255/36- 37}:  \n \nDespite progress with the restructuring and recapitalisation of Ukrainian banks, \nproblems with asset quality and indebtedness persist. Asset quality was affected significantly by the devaluation in the hryvnia in 2008 (52.5 per cent, against the dollar \nand 46.3 per cent, against the euro) and further exacerbated by the 14.8 per cent, \ncontraction of the economy in 2009. Despite Governmental and NBU intervention and \nprogress in stabilising the foreign exchange market by the end of 2009 and during the first ha lf of 2010, the high dollarisation in the Ukrainian financial system increased \nexchange rate risks and could contribute to a worsening of banks’ asset quality. Overdue \nloans are another factor affecting the asset quality of Ukrainian banks. […]  \nIn the past, the NBU has implemented measures aimed at countering the effects of the global financial crisis, supporting the national currency and limiting deposit flight, these \nmeasures included rules restricting Ukrainian banks’ ability to purchase foreign currency on the interbank market to repay the principal amount of foreign currency deposits of \nUkrainian customers and a moratorium on early withdrawals of deposits. While the \nNBU has subsequently lifted many of these measures, in the event of hryvnia \ndepreciation, similar measures may be reintroduced in the future which may adversely affect ability of Ukrainian banks to raise funds.  \n240. It warned that the UAH may “ depreciate further in the near future... Any further currency \nfluctuations may negatively affect the Ukrainian economy and the Bank’s business .” {E1/255/38} . \nAA4/6/69\n66 \n Such concerns were realised. As the NBU explained in its 2014 Annual Report, due to  \nfactors including military conflict, “ unfavorable macroeconomic trends emerged, market \nexpectations markedly deteriorated along with a simultaneous increase in the demand on the \nUkrainian internal market for foreign exchange, increase in its deficit and excessive volatility of the \nhryvnia exch ange rate ” {E7/180/40} . In 2014, the UAH depreciated against the USD by \n97.3% and against the EUR by 74.2% {E7/180/41} . By Q1 2015, the banking system \nhad lost nearly 30% of UAH and over 50% of FX household deposits, with demand \nfor FX far exceeding supply {E17/313.1/18} . \n241. The NBU took “ Anti-Crisis ” measures, including refinancing of banks through \nstabilisation and liquidity loans and market corrective measures such as requirements of compulsory sale of FX proceeds from abroad, a deadline of 90 days for settlements under exports and imports of goods  and limits on withdrawals of deposits in foreign \nand nat"}

The NBU took “ Anti-Crisis ” measures, including refinancing of banks through \nstabilisation and liquidity loans and market corrective measures such as requirements of compulsory sale of FX proceeds from abroad, a deadline of 90 days for settlements under exports and imports of goods  and limits on withdrawals of deposits in foreign \nand national currencies. These were designed to “ ensur[e] guaranteed supply of foreign \ncurrency in the interbank FX market of Ukraine. ” {E7/180/59- 62}, and to “ curb [] panic -\ndriven behavior and prevent[] a flow of foreign currency outside the banking system ” \n{E17/313.1/19 -20}. An example was Resolution 540, introduced in Aug 14 “ to stabilise \nthe monetary and foreign exchange markets of Ukraine ”, which included an obligation on \nbanks to create registers for the purchase of foreign currency {E4/367} . See further \nthe NBU’s 2015 annual report {E12/169/54} . \n(3) Lax regulation of excessive related party lending \n \n242. The rules on related party lending were formalistic and did not assist in catching \nlending that might commonly be regarded as related {E17/313.1/90 -92}, \nRozhkova1/75 {B1/5/18}. As Mr Luchaninov accepted in XX, the “ rules before and in \n2014 were rather loose in identification of the related parties, their monitoring and control and their \nparticipation in the Banks ” {Day9/85:3- 6}.  \n243. The NBU considered that a factor constraining the development of the financial sector was the existence of a large share of related part y loans on bank balance sheets, “ one of \nthe banking system’s most serious problems ” {E12/169/56}  (NBU 2015 Annual Report). It \nset out on a programme of reforms { E10/70/5 } {E10/70/12}  (NBU 2015 \nPresentation), carried out from 2015, which included a “ radically new related -party \nidentification methodology ” {E17/313.1/91} {Day9/85:10- 17}. These were made to satisfy \ncommitments given by Ukraine to the IMF: Rozhkova -1/77– 81 {B1/5/19} , \n{Day3/136:19} -140:2, {E3/169/60- 61} {E3/169/69}  (IMF Apr 14 report) \n{E8/52/78}  {E8/52/85} (IMF Mar 15 report).\n \nAA4/6/70\n67 \n 244. The IMF noted that “ Opaque ownership structures and lending schemes have made it difficult for \nthe NBU to limit effectively banks' exposures to insiders. This highlights the need to strengthen the \nsupervisory framework to better address related lending. International experien ce shows that excessive \nlending to insiders raises the banks' likelihood of failure and reduces expected recovery in cases where \nbanks turn insolvent and need to be resolved .”. Its list of policies in relation to banking \nincluded an “ updated bank recapitalization strategy ” which took into account “ the need to \ngradually unwind related party loans ” {E8/52/20} . It noted that the NBU planned to make \nchanges such that “ existing legislation and regulation on related parties will be strengthened to: (i) \nminimize the risk that excessive lending to insiders could undermine the proper functioning of banks \nin the future; (ii) prevent related party borrowers from receiving bett er credit conditions than non -related \nbank customers; and (iii) enhance su pervisory surveillance over banks .” {E8/52/21} . It set out a \n2015 “ Schedule for Unwinding Related Party Lending in 10 Largest Banks ” at {E8/52/22} \nwhich included “ legislative amendments introducing unlimited liability of bank owners on losses \narising from related party lending” and “tightening of NBU regulations on lending limits to insiders ” \nand provision for liaison between the NBU and banks on reducing their related party exposure.  \n245. The reforms in practice included ( i) the expansion of the definition of a related party \nunder Article 52 of the Law on Banks, ( ii) NBU Resolution 314 of 12.5.15 { E9/174/1 } \nwhich required banks to submit to the NBU a report on active tran"}

These are explained at Rozhkova1/79, 82–88 {B1/5/19}.\n \nC3. LOAN RECYCLING  \n246. Turning to what was in fact going on in the Bank, the evidence shows – or is at the \nvery least consistent with - a system of loan recycling, which took place over a period \nfar longer, and across a set of companies much wider, than the Bank’s ‘Scheme’.  \n247. The Bank criticises Mr Bogolyubov for not “ offer[ing] a specific period for it [viz. the loan \nrecycling] . So it’s said to be simply in full swing by 1 January 2013.” {Day1/35:8- 14}. Mr \nBogolyubov does not need to offer a specific period to make good the point that the patterns of behaviour were ongoing before and after the period focused on by the \nBank. It is also not possible to do so given the limited period over which the Bank ha s \nprovided transactional data: data for relevant companies from the Ukraine and Cyprus \nAA4/6/71\n68 \n branches was provided from 1.1.13, save for the Ukrainian branch accounts of the 193 \nBorrowers which were provided from 2.8.10 {D1/104/1 -3}.  \n248. This dispute is irrelevant as the Bank accepts  that loan and prepayment recycling \nstarted before the alleged ‘Scheme’ : Bank Closing/291(1) {AA2/15/164}. This is also \nclear from the documents as explained in the section of Mr Bogolyubov’s Opening on “Patterns of Behaviour ”, starting at p.14 {AA4/1/18}. Three  particularly clear examples \nare given below.  \n249. Example 1: a spreadsheet of 28.1.13 sent by Mr Krivokoritov to Mr Kazantsev and \nother employees  (over two months before the first Relevant Loan was issued) shows \ncircular movements of funds in which money starts with and ends back at the Bank \n{E1/240} {E1/241} (“ Calculations ” tab).  \n250. Example 2 : an email from Mr Kazantsev to Bank employees of 4.3.13 (a month \nbefore the first Relevant Loan), subject “ PET interest repayment ” sets out sums of dollars \nthat are “ Expected to arrive today ” and states “ On 04/03/13, dollars are to be sold, loans are \nto be repaid” {E1/262} . He attaches a document explaining how the loans are to be \nrecycled, including by use of prepayments and supply agreements {E1/263} .  \n251. Example 3 : an email from Ms Shvetsova to Ms Gurieva of 18.9.13 ( over a month \nbefore the first Relevant Drawdown) , in which she explained the need to replace \n“technical” purchase contracts under which prepayments had been made, that had \nbeen put into place in order to provide collateral under NBU Resolution 23\n41: “All \ncontracts have almost expired and must be replaced ” {E2/117} . She attache d a table showing \nwhich “ technical contract issued for collateral ” needed replacement  and which prepayments \nhad been refunded {E2/118P}.  \n252. The Bank also accepts  that the RDDs  formed part of a recycling scheme. It accepts \nthat the Kazantsev Spreadsheet (which covers the period 30.12.13 – 1.9.14, \nencompassing most of the Relevant Drawdown period of 1.11.13 -1.9.14, but also a \nwider set of drawdowns and prepayments) {E7/39P } records a system of recycling \nprepayments in order to avoid the 90 -day restriction on foreign currency exports: \n{Day2/11:3} -12:10 ; {Day2/14:12} -17:3 ; Bank Opening/4(3) {AA2/1/10}. Mr \nThompson accepted that the Kazantsev Spre adsheet appears to demonstrate "}

It accepts \nthat the Kazantsev Spreadsheet (which covers the period 30.12.13 – 1.9.14, \nencompassing most of the Relevant Drawdown period of 1.11.13 -1.9.14, but also a \nwider set of drawdowns and prepayments) {E7/39P } records a system of recycling \nprepayments in order to avoid the 90 -day restriction on foreign currency exports: \n{Day2/11:3} -12:10 ; {Day2/14:12} -17:3 ; Bank Opening/4(3) {AA2/1/10}. Mr \nThompson accepted that the Kazantsev Spre adsheet appears to demonstrate that there \n \n41  NBU Resolution 23 sets out the conditions for borrowers having sufficient foreign currency reserves \n(to permit lending in foreign currency) {E12/219/18} \nAA4/6/72\n69 \n had been a pattern of loan recycling going on for many months within the Bank \n{Day24/77:9- 13}. Ms Pakhachuk also accepted in XX that the Relevant Loans formed \npart of a recycling scheme:  \nMS MONTGOMERY:  And your analysis suggests that that lending was, to a significant \nextent, to related parties and it was not being repaid but instead rolled over in a loan \nrecycling scheme.  That's your understanding, isn't it?  \nA.   Yes, correct, my Lord.  \nQ.   So that the loans that we are looking at in this case, made in 2013, are part of that loan recycling scheme, aren't they?  \nA.   My Lord, yes.  There was a scheme of recycling loans for many years.  It was in \nplace for many years.                                                                       {Day13/19:3 -12} \n253. Yet the Bank asks the Court to ignore both the fact that the RDDs  were used to repay \nother lending and were themselves repaid.  \n254. The Bank’s acceptance of recycling renders its ‘Scheme’ bizarre. It accepts that, up to \n1.9.14, money was circling around by way of prepayments and returns of prepayments, \nbeing recycled every c.90 days. Yet it claims that, when the ‘ music stopped’  in Sep 14 \ndue to changes in currency regulations, the money was extracted. This raises a number of questions:  \n254.1  If there was a “theft” by Mr Bogolyubov, why would he have first circled the RDDs  around in the Bank first before extracting them? The Bank accepts that \nonly 12 URPPs  were funded directly (in full or part) by RDDs . Otherwise, \nRDDs  went through one or more loops of recycled prepayments before being \nsupposedly extracted as URPPs : Thompson1/Figure 3 -1 {D1/1/29}.  \n254.2  If the Relevant Loans were vehicles to steal money from the Bank, why would so much time have elapsed between the first of the Relevant Loans being issued (3.4.13) and the extraction when the “music stops” (1.9.14)?  \n254.3  Why would changes in currency regulations have triggered the extraction?  \n254.4  How does the Bank’s acceptance that money was being recycled until the “music stopped” on 1.9.14 fit with its allegation that there were 270 “thefts” from the Bank’s vaults at the time of each Relevant Drawdown?  \n255. The Bank has no good answers. The reality, consistent with much of the Bank’s case, is that there was longstanding loan recycling which may or may not have covered a \ndeficit within the Bank generated at some period unknown on the evidence in this case and for reasons not canvassed in these proceedings. But there was no extraction or \n“music stopping” in Sep 14. T he scheme simply metamorphosed : see below .  \nAA4/6/73\n70 \n C4. USE OF “FUNGIBLE ” SHELL COMPANIES  \n256. The companies used in the ‘Scheme’ appear to have been chosen as vessels available \nfor the Bank to use without reference to anyone who ‘owned’ them.  That is evident \nfrom the way in which Bank employees were able to shuttle them in and out of the \n‘Scheme ’, “shuffle ” their directors and borrowers and generate sham contracts . It is the \nBank’s own case that the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers were shell companies: Bank Opening/4(1), 365 {AA2/1/9} {AA2/1/153}.  \n257. That the Bank employees directed the shells and considered them fungible can be seen clearly in the Skype messages and emails. Three examples are given below.  "}

Example 2:  Two emails from Mr Kazantsev from Dec 13 and Jan 14 show borrowers \nbeing switched within the recycling scheme (the ‘horses changed’):  \nFrom whom: Aleksey Kazantsev <aleksey.kazantsev@privatbank.ua>  \nDate: 10 December 2013, 16:41  \nSubject: Company for interest from Cyprus  \nTo: Tamara Travkina <tamara.travkina@privatbank.ua>, Inna Demidchenko  \n<inna.demidchenko@privatbank.ua>, Elena Zemtsova <elena.serbina@privatbank.ua>, Olya  \nDrozdova <olga.kudalenko@privatbank.ua>, Oksana Gudym \n<Oksana.Gudym@privatbank.ua>  \n We are activating new loans:  \n \n1) FORSA LTD LLC  (38895219)  \n(industry: building, project: PJSC Kievguma )  \namount: USD 60,000,000 + UAH amount for capitalisation  \nterm: 3 years  \nOlya Drozdova  \n \n2) REAL -STANDART LLC  (36162739)  \n(industry: building, project: PJSC Kievguma )  \nAA4/6/74\n71 \n amount: USD 60,000,000 + UAH amount for capitalisation  \nterm: 9 -12 months  \nGudym Oksana  \n \n3) ALFATRADER LLC  (36162770)  \n(industry: tourism, project: hotel Split)  amount: USD 50,000,000 + UAH amount for capitalisation  \nterm: 9 -12 months  \nGudym Oksana  \n 4) MITSAR LLC  (32561058)  \n(industry: tourism, project: hotel Split)  due date: USD 50,000,000 + UAH amount for capitalisation  \nterm: 9 -12 months  \nToma Travkina  \n \n5) MILORIN LTD LLC  (36962707)  \n(industry: other, project: Shakh Palace building)  \nterm: USD 15,000,000 + UAH amount for capitalisation  \nterm: 9 -12 months  \nToma Travkina  \ncontact person, Brsuk  \n{E2/223/1 -2} \nFrom: Aleksey Kazantsev  \nSent: Tue 14/01/2014 13:29  To: Tamara Travkina;Oksana Gudym  \nCc: Olya Drozdova  \nSubject: Replacement by new borrowers  \nChanging horses...  \nWe are preparing new lines for:  \n \nORTIKA LLC 38930771  (instead of ALFATRADER LLC) (industry – tourism, project \n– Split Hotel )  –  \n$50,000,000 + UAH for 1 year capitalization;  \n \nRIBOTTO LLC 38939748  (instead of MIZAR LLC) (industry – tourism, project – Split \nHotel ) –  \n$50,000,000 + UAH for 1 year capitalization;  \n \nINTORNO LLC 38939690  (instead of MILORIN LTD LLC) (industry - other, project \n- Shah Palace  \nbuilding)  - $15,000,000 + UAH for 1 year capitalization;  \n{E3/10}  \n260. Example 3:  some companies which previously held real assets began to be used in the \nscheme after they lost their assets and became empty vessels. This was the case for \nthree of the five entities used to hold the “Land M” land plots in Kharkov, namely \nUniks (a Borrow er), Dorteks (a Borrower) and Floreks (an Intermediary Borrower). \nAs the Bank put it, they “ exited that project because their leases were forfeited and they then became \ndefunct companies ” {Day5/39: 11-12} or “assetless ” after Oct 13 {Day1/71:18 } -72:5, well \nprior to their introduction into the ‘Scheme’.  \nAA4/6/75\n72 \n 261.

That Bank employees could shuffle these companies, directors and beneficiaries is \nconsistent with them being companies under their control. It does not necessitate, that \nMr Bogolyubov must have authorised their control of the companies. They were part of the Bank’s toolbox and there is no evidence that Mr Bogolyubov was consulted or \neven told about these activities.  Sections B1 and E provide further examples \ndemonstrating the shuffling and fungibility of shell companies. \n262. A small number of companies holding real assets were used in the scheme, but it is \nevident that their true activities were used as cover and without reference to those \ninterested in the assets e.g.  the Split Hotel considered in Section B5(5)  above .   \nC5. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTROLS  \n263. Mr Bogolyubov described in opening the foreign currency controls Bank employees were trying to avoid in recycling prepayments and using supply agreements: D2 \nOpening/p.20ff {AA4/1/24}. A timeline of relevant regulations, NBU investigations \nand Bank employee actions/responses is at Schedule 3 {AA4/4}. \n264. The Bank accepts  that a purpose of “ recycling ” of RDDs  and prepayments was \n“circumventing Ukrainian currency controls ”: Bank Opening/228 {AA2/1/100}. The \ndispute between Mr Bogolyubov and the Bank therefore centres on the purpose  of \nthis circumvention: was it an employee -led exercise in firefighting (in the Bank’s words \n“something…that these employees dreamt up on their own ” {Day1/36:2- 4}) or designed to \nextract money from the Bank?  \n(1) Purpose of currency control avoidance  \n265. That the circumvention was employee -led is demonstrated by the documents. Two \nexamples given below from 2013 and 2015 show Bank employees discussing regulatory avoidance in preparing responses to NBU information requests: \nExample 1  \nFrom: Olga Korjak  \nSent: Fri 19/04/2013 05:49  To: Dmitrij Luchaninov  \nSubject: Re: About providing information to prepare a response to the NBU  \nGood morning.  \nIf NBU thinks that our bank simply loaned up a client (issued foreign currency, the client sold it and paid us back in hryvnias), that didn't happen. It was all more elegant. The clients took loans and made payments to counter -\nparties, the counter -parties paid off the loans. We mustn't give out anything \nthat's not true, they may come and check how we managed to correct the \nAA4/6/76\n73 \n situation with our currency position.

That Ribotto  payment there is Teamtrend, and there's \na prepayment reference, subject to contract.  So Ribotto is, at the top here, indicating that in this running worksheet, it's the oldest outstanding prepayment. \nIf you go to the bottom, so you see Uniks at line 60.  Line 60, Uniks is the newest, \nso it's been added in at the bottom with a prepayment of 36,800 on 1 August 2014 to Teamtrend, and the payment reference is the Teamtrend -Uniks contract \nreference that we looked at, and the 85 -day date would be 25 October 201 4, except \nthat never happened because the scheme came to an end on 1 September.  So this \nwas unreturned.  \n{Day2/11:3} -12:10  \nMR JUSTICE TROWER :  Just before you leave this one --  you might have \nmentioned it and I didn't pick it up --  what's the significance of the blue lines on \nthe top?  \n MR HUNTER :  […] we surmise that these may be the prepayments which are \nthought to be in need of recycling.  So I'm going to show you the first one, Ribotto, which has --  so perhaps I can --  more specifically we think Ribotto is coded blue \nbecause it's gone past its  85-day date and is about to approach its its 90 -day date, \nso it needs to be recycled.  We think the other (inaudible) may be a slightly different shade of blue, indicating that they are to be partially returned.  That's our --  my \nLord, we are ma king educated deductions in the absence of a witness to ask about \nthis.  What I can show you and what I wanted to show you is, if you go to the next \nday --  so on the PDF if you go to page 13 and you zoom to the top, if look at the \ntop half, you'll see –  \nMR JUSTICE TROWER :  Ribotto has gone.  \nMR HUNTER :  Ribotto has gone but it reappears at the bottom.  \n[…] \nMR HUNTER :  […] So Ribotto goes from the top and that is because the \nprepayments it made under the contracts were listed before, which was about to \nbe repaid, has been repaid and recycled.  You see it appearing at the bottom by \nmeans of a new contract with --  I think it's Teamtrend …  \n[…] \nMR HUNTER :  So it is Teamtrend.  You can see that that records now that \nRibotto is the new loan, the new prepayment out to Teamtrend.  It's made a new \ncontract with Teamtrend of the same amount and it's --  having received in return \nthe prepayment under the first lo an, it then makes an identical contract and \nAA4/6/80\n77 \n prepays it again to Teamtrend, thus resetting the 85 days.  So that's what you see.  \nWhat you see by comparing pages 14 and 13 is an example of recycling.  That is \nhow the sum that was taken by Ribotto is able to be kept in the form of US dollars \nwith Team trend, without that triggering an enquiry because the 90 -day period has \nbeen exceeded and that is recycled. What the Kazantsev spreadsheet tracks -- and \nwe can do this by going back day by days --  is that pattern of recycling, so it's \nkeeping a running tal ly, prepayments, in that way. Just to show you another \nexample.  If we go to page 2, {E7/39P/2}, this is the penultimate Kazantsev spreadsheet and we can see at the bottom that Dorteks has appeared.  \n[…] \nMR HUNTER :  My Lord, that's because that's the first --  28 August is the date \nof the first Dorteks relevant drawdown and return prepayment to Collyer, so it \nappears at row 59 as the most recent drawdown, and Uniks is now at row 40.  It's \nno longer the most recent.  There have been several prepayments in between.

That's when the music stops.  \n{Day2/14:12} -17:3 \n269. As explained above (Section B1(4)), the Kazantsev Spreadsheet can also be used to \ntrace how the prepayments and alleged URPPs  were in reality recycled in loops with \nno money leaving the Bank.  The Gurieva Spreadsheet {E18/213P} records many of \nthe same details as the final sheet of the Kazantsev Spreadsheet {E7/39P/1} , showing \nhow prepayments and supply agreements were recycled over 90 -day periods.  \n270. It is not clear from the metadata whether the paperwork kept by Mr Kazantsev and \nMs Gurieva is forward planning, contemporaneous or a record made after the event. \nWhat is obvious, as the concept is referred to by Mr Kazantsev and Ms Gurieva in an \nemail of 12.5.14 {E3/225} , is that any disbursements are “ technical ” only, the amounts \nare to be repaid the same day or very shortly thereafter.  \n(3) Currency control and recycling after 1.9.14: the music never stops  \n271. The Bank says that the prepayments recorded in the Kazantsev Spreadsheet “ became \nthe Unreturned Prepayments ” when the “ music stopped ”, “end[ing]…the active period of the \nmisappropriation… on 1 September 2014” . The Bank said this followed “increasing scrutiny ” \nby the NBU. After the ‘music stopped’, according to the Bank, “ the Borrowers had \nextracted net unrepaid Relevant Drawdowns  totalling over US$1.9bn ”: Bank Opening/2(5) \n{AA2/1/8},  Bank Opening/234 {A A2/1/103}  {Day2/5:15- 16}. \n272. On this theory, on 1.9.14 the masterminds decided to stop circling the drawdowns around via prepayments, returns of prepayments, loan repayments and further \ndrawdowns, and suddenly extract them. The use of prepayments obtains a novel \nAA4/6/81\n78 \n purpose, no longer to avoid currency controls but to enable Mr Bogolyubov to siphon \nmoney out from the Bank in USD: Bank Opening/2(2)- (5) {AA2/1/7 -8}.  \n273. This shift is key for the Bank’s theory that the money was in fact ‘extracted’ ( i.e. that \nthe recycling it accepts is shown in the Kazantsev Spreadsheet stops); however, it is \nfactually incorrect. As shown in this section, both recycling and currency control \navoidance continued: no ‘music’ stopped. As shown in Section  B2, not only did the \nmajority of RDDs  not fund URPPs  at all, but the URPPs  were not extracted from the \nBank. The idea of ‘extraction’ upon the ‘music stopping’ is also inconsistent with the \nBank’s case that each of the 270 thefts took place at the time of each Relevant \nDrawdown (mostly far earlier than 1.9.14, going through many recycling “loops” \nbefore this point) .  \n274. In its Closing, the Bank claims that there is no dispute that the music stopped as Mr \nBogolyubov agrees that the particular way in which currency regulations were being \navoided through 90 -day prepayments stopped in Sep 14: Bank Closing/278(5) \n{AA2/15/156} . That is not the relevant music. The Bank must show that the recycling \nstopped and suddenly the money was extracted. \n(i) Change in foreign currency regulations \n275. On the Bank’s case (Bank Opening/235) {AA2/1/103} , regulatory change brought \nabout the end of the ‘Scheme’ and the ‘extraction’ of the URPPs .

This in itself is \ndifficult to reconcile with a ‘Misappropriation’, as it implies at once that prepayments \nwere extracted as part of some grand fraud, but at the same time that but for the \nregulatory change, recycling would instead have continued. Indeed, the Kazantsev Spreadsheet records an intention to keep recycling prepayments and supply agreements after 1.9.14: t he final page (dated 1.9.14) sets out as usual the 85 -day \nperiods after which prepayments would need to be replaced. Gardera and Real -\nStandart are in blue text, which in the Bank’s words indicates these are “ prepayments \nwhich are thought to be in need of recycling ” {Day2/14:17- 18}.  \n276. It is true that there were important regulatory changes in Aug 14 and that these brought \nabout changes in behaviour within the Bank. Regulatory changes included an increase \nin the mandatory foreign currency sale threshold to 100% on 21.8.14 and further obligations being placed on Banks in relation to foreign currency purchases, including to form a register {E4/366/1-4}  (NBU Resolution 540 of 29.8.14). On 1.9.14, the \nAA4/6/82\n79 \n NBU wrote to the Bank setting out how future requests to purchase foreign currency \nwould need to be made {E4/367} . \n277. The regulatory changes appear to have come as an unpleasant surprise to the Bank employees (“ Alex cursed it, 100% sale is mandatory!!!!” {K6/45.7/3- 4}, “today is a historical \nevent – 100% sale is mandatory ” {K6/45.10/3- 5}). Mr Luchaninov could not remember \nanyone in the Bank having warning of the changes to the foreign exchange regulations {Day9/79:16- 19} and Skype messages (see below) show employees raising concerns \nas to how debts would continue to be repaid.  \n(ii) The ‘music’ continued \n278. The documents do not show, however, any discussion of any ‘extraction’ of funds. Rather, they evidence employees attempting to find other ways to continue to recycle funds and avoid currency regulations, replacing some foreign currency lending with \nUAH lending and abandoning the paperwork of supply agreement references and \nprepayments. Four key propositions can be drawn from the documents.  \n279. First, as shown by Skypes spanning 1.9.14, Bank employees continued to recycle \ndrawdowns, including providing UAH drawdowns to  purchase USD and repay \nexisting USD loans. ( RDDs  are underlined, Intermediary Drawdowns are in italics .) \nExample 1:  \ndn030464tan (Taranenko, Alla) 28/08/2014 07:37:07  \nLoan for Dorteks purchase of 460,694,152.71 UAH  for the purchase of 33 million \ndollars and counter repayment of amodaras and gardera and a loan for PF Profit \n1,574,500.00 UAH   \ndn030464tan (Taranenko, Alla) 28/08/2014 11:59:51  \nUniks received UAH 18,853,800.00 for the purchase of $1,400,000 for repayment45 \ndn030464tan (Taranenko, Alla) 28/08/2014 13:46:29  \nloan 1 675 000.00 UAH Profit  on PF […]  \ndn030464tan (Taranenko, Alla) 19/09/2014 07:40:48  \nGood afternoon, today there is a purchase for repayment on 23.09.

Secondly , the Skypes show that the NBU sometimes refused the Bank’s requests to \npurchase foreign currency,51 creating problems for recycling. (Ms Taranenko \nexclaimed on 4.9.14 in response to some refusals by the NBU “ That is such a fricking \nmess!” {K6/47.7/5- 6}.)

Due \nto changes in legislation, it will be possible to write off loans long after they have fallen into arrears (borrowers must go through bankruptcy proceedings). Thus, \noverdue loans in the bank's balance sheet will be seen by auditors.  \nBorrowers on this list have significant indebtedness in foreign currencies and defaulting on these loans will not only increase the risks (provision) for these entities but will also increase the risks in the overall industry (project group) to which these  entities are assigned (PET traders, IMRP project, Kievguma project, \nSkorzonera project, etc.).  \nDuring 2015, all currency loans of ~$1.8 billion, issued to \"traders\" across all programmes (ferrotraders, tanker project, rubber project, PET traders, IMRP traders, aircraft traders, Kievguma traders, Split traders, Bukovel traders, traders) will go into arrears. Therefore, the auditors may recognise the debts in these industries (amounting to ~49 billion UAH) as non -performing and subsequently \nirrecoverable and increase the provision for these sectors.  \nIt is now impossible to refinance foreign currency loans (as before), due to the \nrestrictions of the National Bank in the sale of currency on the market and tight \ncontrol of new large disbursements. A possible, temporary solution would be to roll over the loans and postpone the interest payments by one year, retroactively (because the directors of these companies have already been dismissed). During 2015, it will also be necessary to extend the credits of all traders whose credits are about to expire. The extension will postpone the loan servicing problems of the trader lending programmes for 1 year but will not solve the problem systematically.  \nExtending the term of loans (converting these loans to long -term loans) would \nhave a negative impact on the bank's liquidity in terms of the ratio of long- term \ndeposits to long -term loans.  \n{E7/266}   \n(The attached spreadsheet shows a planned replacement of UAH debts of 15 Borrowers with UAH lending to 17 Intermediary Borrowers {E7/267P}. These plans were all carried out, with UAH Intermediary Drawdowns being used to repay drawdowns from UAH Relevant an d Intermediary Loans of \nthe listed Borrowers. Some but not all of the listed Borrowers also had \nRelevant or Intermediary debts in USD.)  \n282. Fourthly , at least some outstanding USD lending was transitioned into UAH lending. \nAll Intermediary Drawdowns from Sep 14 were in UAH. As shown in the Skype \nextracts above, Bank employees discussed the need to purchase particular sums of \nUSD to repay lending and i ssued UAH drawdowns accordingly. They also discussed \nhow to convert USD loans into UAH e.g. : \ndn140478kan (Kazantsev, Aleksey) 03/02/2015 10:07:01  \nForsa has a small loan in USD. let's slowly convert it to UAH.  \ndn290977kon (Drozdova, Olga) 03/02/2015 10:13:47  \nOk. how do you do it nicely? disburse hryvnias to buy dollars and repay? in how \nmany tranches? Is Barsuk aware?  \n{K6/63.2/2}  \nAA4/6/88\n85 \n 283. In conclusion, the Bank employees continued to recycle loans. However, this was not \nalways successful due to the NBU’s refusal of requests to purchase USD. Thus, the recycling fell apart when it was not possible to keep servicing USD loans.  \n284. Alongside continued recycling, the Bank put in place new paperwork to justify its \nforeign currency lending now it could not continue to rely on prepayments and supply \ncontracts, namely ( i) backdated amendments to the Relevant Supply Agreements \n(“RSAs ”) introducing Ukrainian jurisdiction clauses; ( ii) backdated letters from \nsuppliers to borrowers saying they were unable to deliver the goods under RSAs; ( iii) \nbackdated agreements purporting to terminate the RSAs; ( iv) claim forms under the \nRSAs; and ( v) l"}

The Bank’s has repeatedly and loudly claimed that employees were attempting to hide companies connected with D1 and Mr Bogolyubov from the NBU: “ extensive efforts…on \nbehalf of D1-2 to hide the Bank’s related -party borrowers (i.e. the vast lending to D1 -2’s companies)”, \nto “conceal connections to D1 -2” (Bank Opening/38, 40) {AA2/1/25}, “ personnel within the \nBank went to significant lengths to change interests in the borrowers and intermediary borrowers in order to hide the fact that they were related parties  from the NBU .” {Day3/135:21 -25}.\n54 This \nis central to its case that the employees’ actions were fraud, disguising a \n \n54  The Bank suggested that “ the second defendant now agrees that this was the case ” {Day3/136:2 -3}. This is \nwrong. Mr Bogolyubov does not agree, and the evidence does not support, the suggestion that his \nconnections to related parties were being hidden from the NBU.  \n \nAA4/6/89\n86 \n ‘Misappropriation’, not firefighting. As well as being undermined by the documents, \nthese claims were debunked in XX by the Bank’s own witnesses.   \n286. It has tried to shift its case in closing, saying that hiding connections with “ D1-2” was \nsimply part of the issue the Bank had with compliance with related party lending ratios: \nBank Closing/329 {AA2/15/185} . Yet the documents and witness evidence do not \nshow anything to do with hiding connections with Mr Bogolyubov or D1.   \n(1) The Bank’s related party lists  \n287. The Bank produced different types of related party lists: ( i) NBU lists (Bundle K3-\nD), produced quarterly until May 15, and then monthly); and ( ii) IFRS lists (Bundle \nK3-E) (produced quarterly, with an annual list signed by D1 and Mr Bogolyubov).  \n288. The Bank has made various submissions, and produced various hand- outs, purporting \nto show omissions and inaccuracies in the disclosures made in these lists. It is true that \ncompanies were sometimes omitted from the lists despite seemingly being related ( e.g., \nUniks was not included in the 2013 lists despite the ongoing Land M project). Further, \ncompanies were sometimes included in one type of list but not the other ( e.g., Uniks \nwas first included in the NBU list as at 1.6.15 on the basis of Mr Dmytrenko’s \ndirectorship, but first included in the IFRS list as at 1.7.15 on the basis of control by \nthe Bank’s shareholders.)  \n289. The possible explanations for these omissions and inconsistencies include:  \n289.1  different criteria were applicable to the different lists (NBU vs IFRS) as Mr \nLuchaninov accepted {Day9/53:3- 7};  \n289.2  different departments of the Bank were"}

The possible explanations for these omissions and inconsistencies include:  \n289.1  different criteria were applicable to the different lists (NBU vs IFRS) as Mr \nLuchaninov accepted {Day9/53:3- 7};  \n289.2  different departments of the Bank were responsible for compiling different lists (Luchaninov1/21, 24, 39) {B1/3/6}  and they failed to coordinate;  \n289.3  regulatory change in spring 2015 moved from a relatively lax approach to what constituted a “related party” to a far stricter stance;  \n289.4  weaknesses in the integrity of the Bank’s IT systems used to record related parties (as picked up by EY in their 2015 report {E10/217/23} );  \n289.5  a lack of proper procedures and structures to control related party lists (which, as found by the NBU, may lead to an incomplete list of insiders being produced \ne.g. {E4/281/1} {E15/30/22} {E15/33/19} ). \nAA4/6/90\n87 \n 289.6  Bank employees struggling to comply with the regulatory limits and ratios on \nrelated party lending, which may have led to inaccurate reporting (explained below): see e.g. Luchaninov/26 -33, 36- 38 {B1/3/7 -8}.  \n290. At the end of the day, inconsistences and omissions do not matter in and of \nthemselves. The relevant question for present purposes is whether companies related \nto Mr Bogolyubov were deliberately omitted from the lists in an attempt to “conceal” or “hide” t hem. As shown below, they were not. In particular:  \n290.1  although Bank employees did sometimes “shuffle” the directors and beneficial \nowners of companies or alter related party groupings, this was for the purpose \nof (actual or purported) compliance with regulations, not to hide their connections to Mr Bogolyubov ;  \n290.2  when Bank employees identified that Mr Bogolyubov had an interest in a \ncompany, that company was generally added to the list;  \n290.3  companies the Bank has identified during the trial as omitted from lists at one \npoint in time were generally added at a later date.  \n(2) Credit risk ratios, credit concentration and “shuffling”  \n291. The concern of Bank employees to comply with credit risk ratios, in particular around \nthe maximum debt that could be lent to groups of related parties is clear from the \ndocuments. The applicable regulations and ratios were explained in opening (D2 Opening/Section B3(2)) {AA4/1/31} with examples given of the Bank’s reaction to \ndeveloping regulation and scrutiny ( D2 Opening/Schedule 4) {AA4/5} .   \n292. The Bank now accepts that, in at least some instances (see below), concerns about \ncredit risk ratios drove the Bank’s actions. More crucially, the Bank’s witnesses, Mr \nLuchaninov and Ms Lozytska, accepted that this, not concealment, was the rationale.  \n293. As Mr Luchaninov agreed, the Bank’s struggle was not with related parties per se , but \ntheir interconnection, such that the debt of groups of related parties exceeded the \ncapital ratio specified by the NBU. This problem was brought into sharp relief by the \nexpansion of the definition of related parties in Mar 15. As he explained, when the \nNBU “ changed the rules about the related parties identification, our bank was forced to extend new \nrelated parties every month.  This list was becoming longer and longer ev ery month and it resulted in \nthe fact that the ratios of liquidity to the loans have changed significantly ”. Although the problem \nAA4/6/91\n88 \n was exacerbated by the change, it existed beforehand: “ probably this problem started much \nearlier [than 2014]” {Day9/85:18} - 86:22.   \n294. Some examples are given below for the period up to the change in rules in Mar 15. \nThe key examples of “concealment” relied upon by the Bank – the Luchaninov Email, \nRokoman Spreadsheets, GIRTS and the 165 exercise – are then addressed."}

Example 1 : on 23.4.4, Mr Vetluzhskikh asked Mr Luchaninov to analyse the sanctions \nthe NBU may apply for breaches by the Bank of related party loan ratios:  \nFrom: Vyacheslav Vetluzhskikh <slava.vetl@privatbank.ua>  \nDate: 23 April 2014, 1:22 PM  \nSubject:!KT Assessment of possible sanctions on the part of the NBU in \ndetermining problems with management of concentration risks of related \nclients  \nTo: Dmitry Luchaninov <dmitrij.luchaninov@privatbank.ua>  \n“KT”  \nDear Dmitry Vyacheslavovich,  \nAs part of the preparation for a comprehensive inspection, Yuriy Petrovich asked to \nanalyze what consequences the bank may have if, during the inspection, the NBU \nfinds any violations in terms of the bank ’s correct merging of clients into groups of \nrelated clients and the NBU ’s compliance with standards for such client \nconcentrations.  \nF&R have named violations regarding which the NBU might potentially ask questions during the inspection:  \n=====  \nIf there is no list of related clients and when assessing legal cases, during the \ninspection, client groups and credit concentrations or their exceeding of the \nregulatory requirements for indicators (H7 and H8) may be identified, which increases the risk o f non- observance of the following indicators:  \n1. H7 – risk per 1 borrower (group of borrowers);  \n2. H8 – total debt on major loans;  \n3. Capital adequacy indicators (H2, H3, H3 -1), since all the excess amounts (above \nthe standard value) for H7 indicators will be withdrawn from the capital, and then capital will be calculated to determine any violation under H8.  \n4. Depending on the amount of such withdrawals from capital, the indicators of the \ncurrency position may be harmed as well, since capital is used in their calculation.  \n5. In addition, the identification of credit concentrations and failure to reflect them \nin reporting forms No. 611 and file 42 may be regarded as a fact of providing inaccurate (“twisted”) information.  \nIf during the audit a number of clients from concentration groups go through the \nlist of insiders, it is possible that the NBU will begin to recognize such groups as \ninsider groups (such precedents were in the previous audit), so it may affect the \nperforma nce of indicators H9 and H10 and, if they are violated, the exceeding \namount above standard H9 will be withdrawn from the capital, which will also affect \nthe performance of the capital adequacy indicators (H2, H3, H3 -1) and all the others \nwhich depend on c apital level.  \n======  \nAA4/6/92\n89 \n I.e., the list of possible violations is provided above.  \nPlease assess which sanctions NBU may apply to the bank if such violations (such a \nset of violations) are found during the inspection.  \nIf there may be different sanctions options, please evaluate the “worst” and “most probable” options of the sanctions.  \nPurpose: based on such analysis, the management plans to make managerial decisions on the issue of concentrations and make sure that the changes are made before the reporting date, i.e., 01.05.2014.  \nThank you in advance for your prompt assessment.  \nSincerely,  Vyacheslav Vetluzhskikh  \nInternal Auditing Department  \nPrivatBank                                                                                              {E3/208}  \n296.

As explained above, regulatory change in Mar 15 brought a significant expansion in \nthe definition of related parties under Art. 52, with further regulations and guidance \nfollowing in Resolution 314 {E9/174} and Resolution 315 {E9/176}  of 12.5.15. \n301. This led in turn to a significant expansion of the Bank’s NBU list, with 154 companies \nadded to the 1.7.15 list, the majority on the basis of connections through an individual director to existing related parties {K3 -D/105P} {Day10/17:5- 17}. \n302.

Shortly thereafter, by NBU Resolution 312 of 12.5.15, the NBU reduced the permitted \nN9 ratio of total related party lending to regulatory capital from 30% to 25% (taking \neffect in Jun 15 {E9/175/7} Beketov 8/fn.186 {C1/1/153}). Reforms were also \nbrought in requiring a recapitalisation programme for some of Ukraine’s largest banks, \nincluding the Bank (Rozhkova/89 -95) {B1/5/21} . This produced a perfect storm, \nnecessitating a significant extension of the Bank’s related party list at the same time as \na significant  reduction in the permitted amount of total related party lending. The Bank \nwas, as a result, concerned it would not be able to comply with the new regulations: \nLuchaninov/26 -33, 36- 38 {B1/3/7 -8}. \nAA4/6/96\n93 \n 304. This came at a time when the Bank was already failing to comply with related party \nlending ratios ( e.g. the NBU’s 15.8.14 report found that the ratio of total related party \nlending as at 1.5.14 was 41.26% compared to the regulatory 30% {E4/281/4}  and EY \nfound in its report of 16.7.15 that, as at 1.4.15, the Bank’s N9 ratio was 89.5% \ncompared to the required maximum 25% {E17/242/51} ). \n(4) The reality: the Luchaninov Email  \n305.

The NBU announced an unscheduled inspection on 24.3.15 { E8/124.2}, which \ninitially focused on foreign currency control (as the Bank accepts {Day15/109:16- 18}). \nThe focus was widened to include questions about related parties by Request 2 of 30.3.15 {E8/143.2}  (as the Bank accepts {Day15/111: 7-11} ).  \n308. The Luchaninov Email was a direct response to Request 2. The Bank now appears to accept this {Day15/110: 20} -115:1 4\n55, and it is clear from the documents. Mr Pikush \nasked Mr Luchaninov to provide information in response to Request 2 by 10am on 1.4.15 {E8/162. 1/2} and Mr Luchaninov in turn sought Ms Shvachka’s assistance \n{E8/143.3} . Ms Shvachka’s analysis (i.e. what became the “Luchaninov  Email”) \nappears to have been produced in response {E8/158}  and Mr Luchaninov’s email of \n1.4.15 to Mr Pikush attaching the analysis expressly said it was sent “ in reference to the \nunplanned audit by the National Bank of Ukraine of 42 clients ” {E8/163} . \n309. It appears therefore that the Bank has abandoned the theory, set out in Mr Luchaninov’s witness statement (Luchaninov1/54 {B1/3/14} ), that the exercise was \n \n55 The Bank previously said that the Luchaninov Exercise was triggered by Request 27: Bank \nOpening/284 -293 {AA2/1/121} . \nAA4/6/97\n94 \n prompted by concerns about a criminal investigation into the 42 Borrowers. Mr \nLuchaninov accepted quickly in XX that this was not the trigger:  \nMS MONTGOMERY: {E8/163}, please, Mr Luchaninov.  There was an unplanned audit \nin relation to 42 clients; is that right?  \nA.   Yes.  \nQ.   Those were the same 42 clients that you’ d been asked to investigate back in February \nin Request 27?  \nA.   Yes.  \nQ.   So although your witness statement says this email was sent because of a criminal \ninvestigation, the reality is that this issue about the 42 clients had been evident to you because of the press report in NashiGroshi?  \nA.   Yes.                                  {Day9/91:15} - 92:1 \n310. The Bank also appears to have abandoned the theory that Mr Luchaninov  was given \ninstructions for the exercise in a meeting a week or two before the Luchaninov Email \nwas sent (Luchaninov 1/52 -55) {B1/3/13}, now saying that instructions were given \nin a meeting of 30.3.15 {Day15/114: 2-10}. This was never put to Mr Luchaninov, and \nso is pure speculation by the Bank; however, the date of any meeting is irrelevant to \nthe question of why the exercise was performed.  \n(ii) The purpose of the exercise \n311. The Bank’s position is that the Luchaninov Email exercise was designed to “ conceal ” \nor “bury” connections between the 24 Borrowers, D1 and Mr Bogolyubov: “ the NBU \nmust not know that these 42 borrowers are linked to D1 and D2 ” {Day15/110:20 } -115:14 , \nBank Opening/284- 293 {AA2/1/121}. \n312. It is clear on the face of the Luchaninov Email itself that the exercise in fact concerned \ncredit risk ratios. The header stated that “ Potential insiders are individuals/legal entities, \nwho/which fall under the category of “ insider ”, but are not included in the quarterly list due to risk-\nrelevant relations and violation of ratios.” {E8/164} .56 \n313. The Luchaninov Email analysis did not suggest t"}

It is clear on the face of the Luchaninov Email itself that the exercise in fact concerned \ncredit risk ratios. The header stated that “ Potential insiders are individuals/legal entities, \nwho/which fall under the category of “ insider ”, but are not included in the quarterly list due to risk-\nrelevant relations and violation of ratios.” {E8/164} .56 \n313. The Luchaninov Email analysis did not suggest that the 24 Borrowers were potentially related on the basis of interests held in them by Mr Bogolyubov.\n57 Rather, it states that \neach of the 24 Borrowers could be considered related by virtue of a director  which it \nhad in common with a different  company in which D1 and/or Mr Bogolyubov  did have \nan interest {E8/165} . Such connections were pertinent after the expansion of Art. 52.  \n \n56  There is a different translation of this document at { E8/161}  (referred to by the Bank in oral opening \n{Day3/146:20} -147:7), where “violation of ratios” is instead translated as “non-compliance”. However, \nthe Bank appears to accept that the “violations of ratios” translation is correct: {Day3/147:18 -19} \n57  As the Bank has noted, D1 and Mr Bogolyubov did have interests in a couple of the 24 Borrowers at \nthis time; however, these were not identified in the Luchaninov Email . \nAA4/6/98\n95 \n 314. This was supported by Mr Luchaninov  in XX, who made the crucial concession that \n“we’re not hiding information about Mr Kolomoisky or Mr Bogolyubov here ” {Day9/93:1 -2}. \n315. This was in complete contradiction to the Bank’s case and (seemingly) its expectations \nof the evidence Mr Luchaninov would give. It had stated in oral opening that Mr \nLuchaninov’s evidence on how he was told to respond to the NBU’s requests would \nbe: “ Not “Let’s report truthfully back to the NBU and tell them what parties are related or not \nrelated”. What Luchaninov is actually instructed to do by Pikush, by Gurieva, by Yatsenko, is, “Bury it.  Sever the connections”.  So that was his brief and he duly fulfilled it.” {Day3/144:9-\n14}, “Mr Luchaninov himself will tell your Lordship that those persons connected to the Bank were \nD1 and D2 and the concern was not principally credit risk ratios, although that ’s always in the \nbackground, but the spectre of a criminal investigation into the misappropriation of funds from the Bank via D1 and D2 companies, arising from allegations of misuse of the NBU refinancing loans.  \nThat’s what drove this, not some concern about breaching credit risk ratios .” {Day3/146:2- 14}. \nHis evidence was the opposite.  \n316. In XX, Mr Luchaninov was taken through a couple of examples from the Luchaninov \nEmail analysis, showing that the purpose was “shuffling” not “hiding”.  \n317. Example 1: Agroprom {Day9/93:3- 24}. Where the Luchaninov Email identified that \nD1 or Mr Bogolyubov had actual (indirect) interests in companies, these were  included \nin the Bank’s related party lists.  \n317.1  The Luchaninov Email states that Agroprom may be considered related \nthrough its director, Mr Karnaukh. He was also a director of Sintez Oil, in \nwhich D1 and Mr Bogolyubov  held indirect interests through four Cypriot \ncompanies: Clanton, Prescona, Inofos and Portial {E8/165} . \n317.2  Clanton, Prescona, Inofos and Portial were already included in the Bank’s IFRS \nlist at this time as companies “ with significant participation of the Bank’s shareholders ” \n{K3-E/89P/17 } (#324, 326, 327, 328). They were added into the 1.4.15 NBU \nlist on the same basis {K3-D/98P}  (#15, 17, 18, 30)  \n317.3  Sintez Oil was added to the NBU list at 1.4.15 as a “ Company with significant \nparticipation of shareholders of the Bank ” {K3 -D/98P}  (#24) and was added to the \n1.7.15 IFRS list on the same basis {K3 -E/95P/29}  (#562). (Point (3) was not \ncovered in XX.) \nAA4/6/99\n96 \n 318. This is just one example; however, all companies in which the Luchaninov Email \nidentifies Mr Bo"}
{"start": 266000, "text": "} (#324, 326, 327, 328). They were added into the 1.4.15 NBU \nlist on the same basis {K3-D/98P}  (#15, 17, 18, 30)  \n317.3  Sintez Oil was added to the NBU list at 1.4.15 as a “ Company with significant \nparticipation of shareholders of the Bank ” {K3 -D/98P}  (#24) and was added to the \n1.7.15 IFRS list on the same basis {K3 -E/95P/29}  (#562). (Point (3) was not \ncovered in XX.) \nAA4/6/99\n96 \n 318. This is just one example; however, all companies in which the Luchaninov Email \nidentifies Mr Bogolyubov as holding an interest were included in at least one of the \nBank’s related party lists at the time of the Luchaninov Email or shortly thereafter. \nThe references are set out in a table at: Schedule 7 .  \n319. Example 2: Uniks {Day9/94:1} - 95:11 . In some cases where a change proposed in \nthe Luchaninov Email was implemented, the Borrower was nonetheless included in a Bank related party list, inconsistent with “ hiding ”. See Section E 5 on Uniks below. \nThis was also the case for 15 of the other 24 Borrowers listed in the Luchaninov Email: \nsee the references in Schedule 7. The consequence is that the Bank’s statement that \nthe Luchaninov Email proposals were “ implemented ” at least in 22 out of 24 cases \n{AA2/2/4}  {Day15 /126: 10-13} does not tell the full story and no “concealment” can \nbe inferred from their implementation.  \n320. The Bank’s submission that the Luchaninov Email exemplifies “ D1-2’s inner circle at the \nBank [going] to significant lengths to conceal D1- 2’s interests in the Borrowers and Intermediary \nBorrowers from the NBU ” (Bank Opening/283) {AA2/1/121}  cannot be correct. Equally, \nnor does the Luchaninov  Email provide evidence that Mr Bogolyubov owned and \ncontrolled all 24 Borrowers {Day15/97:24} - 98:1. \n321. The Lu chaninov Email is not the only example of the Bank’s employees removing \nconnections between companies to try to comply with ratios on related party lending, \ne.g. on 19.11.15, Mr Luchaninov emailed to Mr Yatsenko a “ list of companies for untying \nconnections, with a total debt of UAH 4.2 billion …the details for untying were worked out any \npresented for all legal entities where there are no bank shareholders in the structure of the ultimate beneficial owners .” {E12/28.3}  {E12/28.4P} . \n(iii) The Bank’s submissions after XX \n322. The Bank remains in denial, maintaining in the face of Mr Luchaninov’s evidence that “it is quite clear that the purpose of Mr Luchaninov’s proposals was to conceal D1 -2’s connections to \n24 of the Borrowers”: Bank Closing/329(4) {AA2/15/187 }. \nBank’s submission  D2’s response  \nMr Luchaninov was not \nchallenged on Luchaninov1/52 -\n53 {B1/3/13 -14} \n{Day15/113:15 } -115:5 \n{Day15/123: 5-12}, Bank \nClosing/339(1) {AA2/15/197}.  This was challenged in XX. Mr Luchaninov \naccepted that the Email was not sent because \nof a criminal investigation and that the \nexercise was not to do with concealing D1 or \nBogolyubov {Day9/91:15} - 93:2. {AA4/ 13} \n{AA4/ 13} \nAA4/6/100\n97 \n The purpose of the Luchaninov \nEmail was to “ bury” connections \nbetween the Bank and D1 and \nD2 and Mr Luchaninov was told \nthat “ the NBU must not know that \nthese 42 borrowers are linked to D1 \nand D2 ” {Day15/115: 1-6}. Mr Luchaninov accepted in XX that “ we’re not \nhiding information about Mr Kolomoisky or Mr \nBogolyubov here ” {Day9/93:1 -2}. He gave no \nevidence (written or oral) that he was told that \nthe “ NBU must not know that these 42 borrowers \nare linked to D1 and D2”. (The relevant section \nof his witness statement begins at \nLuchaninov1/52 {B1/3/13} .) \nThe Luchaninov Email had \n“nothing to do with credit \nconcentration ” and “ this wasn’t \nchallenged ” {Day15/114:21 -22} \n{Day15/117: 8} -118:11 , Bank \nClosing/337(2) -(3) \n{AA2/15/196}  \n Mr Luchaninov did not give evidence (written or oral) that the exercise was not about credit \nconcentration.

{"start": 269500, "text": "ion \nof his witness statement begins at \nLuchaninov1/52 {B1/3/13} .) \nThe Luchaninov Email had \n“nothing to do with credit \nconcentration ” and “ this wasn’t \nchallenged ” {Day15/114:21 -22} \n{Day15/117: 8} -118:11 , Bank \nClosing/337(2) -(3) \n{AA2/15/196}  \n Mr Luchaninov did not give evidence (written or oral) that the exercise was not about credit \nconcentration. To the contrary, his evidence \nwas that the exercise was  related to credit \nratios: see Luchaninov1/37, 58- 59 {B1/3/9} \n{B1/3/15}. \nIt was put to Mr Luchaninov in XX that the \nexercise was about credit concentration, not \nhiding connections to D1 and Mr \nBogolyubov. He accepted it was not about \nhiding {Day9/92:2} - 93:2.  \nA new argument made at Bank Closing/216 {AA2/15/125 } that \nthe Bank employees’ attempts to manage concentrations of related parties “\nnecessarily involved hiding \nD1-2’s ownership and control over \nthese companies ”  This appears to be a retreat from the Bank’s \nposition that the primary purpose of the \nexercise was “ hiding ”. Yet it is still inconsistent \nwith both Mr Luc haninov’s evidence (that the \nexercise was not about hiding) and the \ndocuments, which contain no suggestion of \nhiding interests. Moreover, unless it was the \npurpose of the exercise to hide Mr \nBogolyubov’s interests, the arguments on \nrelated parties do not assist the Bank. \n323. In particular where it chose not to re -examine Mr Luchaninov, the Bank cannot now \nmaintain that the exercise had anything to do with hiding Mr Bogolyubov’s interests.  \n(5) The reality: the Rokoman Spreadsheets  \n324. The Rokoman Spreadsheets are another exercise claimed to be designed “ to conceal \nconnections to D1 -2” (Bank Opening/40) {AA2/1/25}. Their true purpose was in fact \nreducing credit concentration for groups of related parties. This is clear from the \ndocuments and Ms Lozytska’s evidence  and has been accepted to an extent by the \nBank: “ the context is indeed the Bank’s concern that it will, if the NBU realises the extent of the \nrelated party lending, be found to have violated the credit risk ratios ” {Day4/1:6- 10}. \nAA4/6/101\n98 \n (i) The Rokoman Email {E10/264}  \n325. The purpose of the exercise is stated on the face of the Rokoman Email: “ At the first \nstage we suggest to replace directors with new ones, which will allow to significantly reduce concentrations \nacross all groups, and 15 groups will be normalized . At the second stage beneficiary owners should be \nchanged ,…” {E10/264} (emphasis added). The Bank accepted that this email showed \nthat Ms Rokoman “ envisaged changing the directors and/or beneficial owners of 31 offshore \ncompanies so as to avoid them being classified as related parties and to reduce the group debt associated \nwith their nominal beneficial owners ” {Day4/2:6- 10}. \n326. Ms Lozytska  also accepted in XX that the concern in this email was reducing credit \nconcentration across groups . The Bank’s attempt to salvage this by saying in essence \nthat “ hiding ” was still a side -effect of the attempts to change related party \nconcentrations (Bank Closing/341(3) {AA2/15/198}) face the same problems as in \nrelation to the Luchaninov Email above. Ms Lozytska  (whose evidence is not even \nmentioned by the Bank) did not suggest they were doing any “ hiding”: \nQ.  And what Ms Rokoman is concerned about is credit concentrations.  Can you \nsee that in the second -last line?  She ’s concerned about reducing concentration \nacross groups.  Do you see that?  \nA.  Yes.  \nQ.  What does that mean?  \nA.  What this means is that, so far as some of the clients are concerned, it \nwas necessary to change -- and mind you, I'm just reading this \ndocument; I ’m not relying on this document in my witness statement, \nso it’s the first time I ’m seeing this document – the directors had to be \nchanged with respect to some of the clients in order to make sure that \nthere ’s no group interrelationship, so that there were fewer parties in \nthat group and so that the total outstand"}

I appreciate it appears that you weren ’t shown the email from Ms Rokoman, \nbut it ’s clear, isn ’t it, that the Rokoman email that we were looking at, which \nyou were copied in on, is – the main purpose was not to be in violation of \npermissible lending limits to related parties set by the NBU?  \nA.  Yes, that is true.                                                       {Day10/9:15} -11:658 \n(ii) Changes of Directors (Rokoman Directors Spreadsheet) {E10/279.2P}  \n327.

The \n \n58  She then went on to say that {E10/264}  “deals mainly with a proposed change of beneficial owners and directors…It \ndeals with concentration to a much lesser extent .” {Day10/11:10 -14}. It is unclear what is meant by this and her \nearlier answers agreeing that it was about reducing concentration should be accepted.  \nAA4/6/102\n99 \n various columns of the spreadsheet show (left -right) the IDs of groups of companies \nwith debt over 4 billion (“ 39 groups > 4 billion debt ”) the “ debt by groups today ”, the \n“reduction of the debt after the replacement of managers ” and finally the “ New debt for groups ”. 4 \nbillion appears to have been the Bank’s N7 ratio {K6/70.11/2}  (i.e. the maximum \namount of credit risk per counterparty or group of related counterparties {C1/113/9}).  \nThe Bank accepts that this spreadsheet shows that Ms Rokoman was seeking to reduce \ngroup debt by replacing directors: {Day4/2:19} - 20:1.  \n328. Two other factors show that the purpose was not hiding Mr Bogolyubov’s interests in \nthe Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers. First , the spreadsheet lists 82 companies, \nincluding 22 Borrowers and 23 Intermediary Borrowers, but also many other \ncompanies. Secondly , not all the proposals are implemented. E.g., as flagged by the \nBank {Day4/3:13- 15}, row 25 of p.2 of the spreadsheet proposes removing Mr \nDmytrenko as director of Uniks. What the Bank did not mention is that Uniks was added to the NBU 1.6.15 list o n the basis of its director being Mr Dmytrenko {K3 -\nD/101P} (#53). It was removed from the NBU list as at 1.11.15 “ due to  O. V. \nDmytrenko exclusion ” {K3-D/129P} (#24). Uniks’ EDRPOU extract from 31.12.16 lists \nMr Dmytrenko as still in office {K3 -A1/172/4} .  \n(iii) C\nhanges of Beneficiaries (Updated Rokoman Spreadsheet) {E10/265} \n{E10/279.3P}   \n329. The purpose of the second Rokoman Spreadsheet is also clear on its face. The columns \nshow the “ Beneficiary Group Debt Now”, the “ Amount the group will decrease after the beneficiary \nchange ” and finally the “ Debt by group after beneficiary change ”, generally reduced to below \nUAH 4bn (the N7 ratio). The Bank recognised that this  showed the “ reduction in group \ndebt which the change [to the beneficiary]  would produce ” {Day4/11:15 -23}. \n330. When shown the earlier version of this spreadsheet at {E10/265P} , Ms Lozytska \nultimately accepted (after being reminded of Lozytska/3659 {B1/6/10}  and with the \ncaveat that she did not work with the document, despite it being sent to her at the \ntime) that it was about reducing group debt:  \nQ.

{"start": 276500, "text": ". When shown the earlier version of this spreadsheet at {E10/265P} , Ms Lozytska \nultimately accepted (after being reminded of Lozytska/3659 {B1/6/10}  and with the \ncaveat that she did not work with the document, despite it being sent to her at the \ntime) that it was about reducing group debt:  \nQ.  So are you telling us you had no idea at the time why column F [debt by group after \nbeneficiary change] and the calculation there was being done?  \n \n59  “At the time of receiving such emails, I considered it likely that the main purpose of the corporate \nchanges proposed by those emails was to ensure that the Bank was not seen to be in violation of \npermissible lending limits to related parties set by the NBU, which could give rise to penalties.”  \nAA4/6/103\n100 \n A.  Well, the way the calculations were done, I had no idea, and I was cc’ d in \norder for me to also understand that these clients, that is column C, the \nnames of non -resident companies – that they had to be replaced, and in this \ncase, replacement of beneficiary in order to de- affiliate the group and \ntherefore then the sum would be reduced by 4 million.  \nQ.  So it is about concentration of risk, isn’ t it?  \nA.  The concentration of risk – my Lord, I am currently saying that I did not work \nwith the document, I haven ’t seen it before[60] and I ’m just trying to state my \nposition. Initially, in this situation, one needs to replace the corporate \nownership structure and then that would lead to the change in concentration.                                                                    \n{Day10/12:16} - 13:6 \nQ.  […]   We can see, Ms Lozytska, in this that a beneficiary who is coded “ B20” has at \nthe start 52 billion hryvnia in a group associated with him and there are beneficiary \nchanges – I’m just going to go through one – which lead to a decreased amount in \nthat group.  Do you agree?  \nA.  Well, yes, I agree.  It is simply – it wasn ’t me putting the table together, \ntherefore it ’s difficult for me and I ’m currently trying to follow online and to \nfigure things out.  I would be most grateful to be able to read all the headings in Russian so as to understand clearly.  \nQ.  Let me see if I can get to it in a simpler way.  I can tell you that “ B20”, that code, is \na man called Vadym Pereviznyi.  Is that a name that rings a bell?  \nA.   Yes, I have come across his name in the documents.  \n Q. And we can see that Petrolynk has had its beneficiary changed from him to \nsomebody else.  I think you saw the Russian for that.  We ’ve got “ Beneficiary \nchanged (A1) ”  \nA.  Yes, I can see that the beneficiary has changed to A1 based on this table.  \nQ.  And that is being done only in order to reduce the group of concentrated risk.  It’ s \nnot being done, I suggest, to remove Petrolynk as a related party.  \nA.  Yes, I would agree with such a statement.                              {Day10/15:3} -16:2 \n331. Four other factors show the purpose was not “hiding”. First , not all the suggested \nchanges were implemented, as the Bank accepts {AA2/2/6} .  \n332. S econdly , in some cases, even though a company’s beneficiary was changed, it was still \nincluded in a subsequent related party list. E.g. , the spreadsheet recorded that the \nbeneficiary of Petrolynk Holdings SA (row 10) had been changed from “ B20” (Vadim \nPereviznyi {E9/171P/16} ) to “ A1”. The corporate documents show the beneficiary \nwas changed to Igor Karnaukh as of  11.6.15 {K3-B/487} . Petrolynk  was nonetheless \nincluded in the NBU related party list as at 1.7.15 on the basis of its ownership interest \nin Riniks and Mialis {K3-D/105P/1}  (#31) and remained in the list until its removal \nas at 1.3.16 {K3 -D/157P/2}  (#3) . \n \n60  This is incorrect. It was sent to her at the time {E10/264} . \nAA4/6/104\n101 \n 333.

F ourthly , some of the replacement beneficiaries proposed in the spreadsheet were \nindividuals who had been “shuffled” out as directors of companies under the Luchaninov Email exercise e.g.  Mr Karnaukh and Ms Burkhan. There would be no \npoint shuffling the same individuals around different companies if the purpose was to remove them to “hide” Mr Bogolyubov’s interests.  \n(6) The reality: GIRT S \n335. A further example of changes in corporate structure for the purpose of credit concentration ratios is the proposal to remove Ms Velk and Mr Rzhevskyi as shareholders in GIRTS (an existing related party) { E10/98} , seemingly as Ms Velk \nand Mr Rzhevsky were also involved in three other companies (Raneya, Kartservis and \nAEF) {E10/99} . Mr Luchaninov accepted that the Bank changed the owners of \nGIRTS “ in a perfectly proper attempt to ensure that that didn’t become a connected party for the \npurpose of credit conce ntrations ” – “Yes, as far as I know, the changes have been implemented as \nsuggested ” {Day9/95:12} -96:18 , Luchaninov/89 {B1/3/20} . Ms Lozytska also \naccepted that the purpose of the change was to avoid breaching related party lending \nrequirements: Lozytska/36 {B1/6/10}.  \n336. The Bank says EY was “ lied to ” when it was told that Ms Velk and Mr Rzhevskyi \nwanted to sell their stakes in GIRTs and (contrary to Mr Luchaninovs evidence) that \n“there wasn’t a perfectly proper attempt to ensure that GIRTS didn’t become a related party. This \nwas an improper attempt to ensure that AEF and Raneia could be excluded from the related party \nlist” {Day15/143:1 7} -145:1, Bank Closing/334(2) {AA2/15/191}. This is undermined \nby the following facts : (i) the Bank had already accepted EY’s findings that AEF, \nRaneya and Kartervis were related to  the Bank {E17/241/28- 29}; (ii) they were \nincluded in the list sent by the Bank to the NBU on 22.9.15 of 33 parties agreed by the \nBank to be related {E11/156} {E11/158P} (##20, 22- 23); (iii) they  companies were \nadded to the NBU list for 1.10.15 on the basis of their connections to Ms Velk and \nMr Rzhevskyi {K3 -D/124P} (##1 -3) and then removed in the 1.11.15 list on the basis \nof the “ exclusion ” of Ms Velk and Mr Rzhevskyi {K3 -D/129P/2}  (##82 -84). Whatever \nwas going on here, it is not consistent with the Bank’s connection to these companies being “ concealed ”. \nAA4/6/105\n102 \n (7) The reality: the 165 exercise \n337. On 31.7.15 the NBU provisionally designated 165 companies as related to the Bank \n{E10/266} . The Bank alleges that the response to this was “ concerted action … taken to \nconceal the true UBOs of yet further groups of Bank clients, including borrowers and intermediary borrowers .” {Day4/22:5- 9}. The evidence shows that the Bank employees’ response \nwas to attempt to reduce the related party list; however, the concern was related party debt levels, not concealment. In particular: \n337.1  Mr Luchaninov’s evidence was that “ instructions given by the Bank’s senior \nmanagement…were that the Bank should not recognise, as far as possible, that any of the \n165 Customers were related parties of the Bank. The Bank’s senior management was very \nconcerned that, if the 165 Customers were found to be related parties, the Bank would consequently be in breach of the limits on lending to related parties .” Luchaninov/67 \n{B1/3/16}  \n337.2  The Bank had already decided to include 17 of the 165 companies in its 1.8.15 list {E10/271 } {E10/272P} , including seven Borrowers"}

This included \nall eight companies65 identified as related to the Bank through D1 and/or Mr \nBogolyubov in an analysis conducted by Ms Shvachka on 28.8.15 of 88 companies identified by the NBU {E11/91.1} {E11/91.2} and (with overlap) \nall 10 companies\n66 in which Mr Bagno had identified D1 and/or Mr \nBogolyubov held an interest over 10% {E11/243} {E11/244} . \n337.4  The Bank’s employees’ discussions about disaffiliating related parties specify the debt associated with those parties e.g. {E12/30} {E12/31P} and Mr \nDubilet expresses concern to keep the total amount of debt under 43bn \n \n61  Favore, Elsis Time, Transmoloko, Ribotto, Inkeriya, Alfatrader, Vesta  \n62  Dampir, Stimeks  \n63  These are not all ultimately included in the Bank’s 1.10.15 related party list, which includes 24 new \nrelated parties: { K3-D/124P } \n64  Industrial Garant , Tamersa , Orbela , Tseris , AEF , Raneya , Favore , Transmoloko, Ribotto , Inkeriya  \n65  ZFZ, Skorzonera, Borivazh, Dnipro, NPC -Halychyna, NFZ, MGOK, Dniproazot  \n66  Dniproazot, ZFZ, MGOK, NFZ, Dnipro FC, NPC -Halychyna, Ukrtatnafta, Skorzonera, Borivazh  \nAA4/6/106\n103 \n {E17/202/4- 5}. As the Bank itself pointed out, EY identified that the N9 ratio \nwas massively over the limit which “ clearly presented a real and serious problem for the \nBank ” {Day15/152:14- 15}. \n(8) The reality: the Cyprus branch  \n338. The Bank has suggested that the Bank went “ to considerable lengths to keep information about \nthe ownership of its Cyprus branch clients secret from the NBU ” {Day4/4:14- 22}. Mr \nLuchaninov also suggested in his witness statement that Cyprus branch companies \nwere being hidden from the NBU, relying on {E3/66 /2} (in which Mr Pikush suggests \nproviding the “ right documents ” to the auditors): Luchaninov/46- 49 {B1/3/12}. \n339. However, on being shown this email in XX, Mr Luchaninov agreed that the exercise \nwas once again about debt concentration, as is clear from the email (“ there will be \nproblems with the concentration of related parties ” {E3/66 /3}):  \nQ.   And … we can see the same thing happening in relation to Cyprus, I suggest, at \n{E3/66/3}.  […]  \nA.   I have read the document, my Lord, and as I provided evidence in my witness statement, I think that the “ right ” documents in the inverted commas mean \nthat NBU should be provided with the documents that cannot identify the related parties.  So by this I thought that Mr Morgachev, who brought documents from the Cyprus branch, should make an impression for NBU that \nthese are not related parties and not to disclose the connections with the Bank.  \nQ.   That’s not right, is it, Mr Luchaninov?  I appreciate that ’s what you say in your \nstatement but we can see from the language here the problem is the concentration of \nrelated parties; in other words, they ’re not to be hidden in the sense of being said not \nto be related. What ’s being avoided is anything that shows the links so as to avoid the \nproblem of concentration of related parties.  Do you see that? \n A.  Yes, I can see this.                      {Day9/90:8} - 91:3 \n340. Mr Luchaninov  also accepted in XX that he received advice from Cypriot lawyers that \nbeneficial owners could not be disclosed because of Cyprus bank secrecy laws \n{Day9/88:10} -89:1 {K6/45.4/2} .

Further, as shown in Schedule 7 , Cypriot \ncompanies mentioned in the Luchaninov Email { E8/165} were added to NBU lists \non the express basis of their connection to Mr Bogolyubov. \n(9) The reality: further examples in Mr Luchaninov’s witness statement  \n341. Mr Luchaninov  gave two further examples of the Bank taking steps to disaffiliate \nrelated parties. Again, the purpose was not hiding (and he does not suggest it was).  \n342. Example 1 – “10 companies” : On 9 .10.15, Mr Luchaninov sent an email to Mr \nYatsenko requesting that Mr Novikov organise the replacement of the beneficial owners of ten customers which had a total debt of UAH 12 billion {E11/267} {E11/268P}  (Luchaninov/86- 87) {B1/3/20 }. The importance of this debt figure is {AA4/ 13} \nAA4/6/107\n104 \n clear from the email and Mr Luchaninov states that the “ main objective was to reduce the \ntotal amount of debt that was linked to the Bank’s related parties ” (Luchaninov/89). Five of \nthe customers67 had already been included in the list of 33 related companies sent by \nMr Dubilet to the NBU {E11/156} {E11/158 P}, inconsistently with “hiding” . \n343. Example 2 – AEF and Kartservis : On 21.10.15, Mr Luchaninov sent an email to Ms \nGurieva containing recommendations to avoid the need to include AEF and \nKartservis in the next NBU list  {E11/308} . He noted that the purpose of removing \nthem was because they had significant debts which was relevant to the Bank’s \ncompliance with the related party lending ratios (Luchaninov/88 -89) {B1/3/20 }. As \nexplained above  ¶336, they were also included in various NBU lists, inconsistently with \n“hiding”.  \n(10) Companies related to Mr Bogolyubov were added to the lists  \n344. The idea that there was some concerted attempt to hide companies related to Mr Bogolyubov is also belied by the fact that companies identified by Bank employees as \nrelated to him were generally included in the lists.  \n345. For example: ( i) in Jul/Aug 13, Bank employees discussed whether Stalmag  should be \nincluded in the related party list as it was indirectly held by D1 and Mr Bogolyubov. \nMr Tabakov said it should be (“ STALMAG – please include it in the related ”) {E2/85} , \nand it was included in the 1.10.13 NBU list on the basis of shareholder control {K3 -\nD/56P/1 }; (ii) companies were regularly added to the lists as “ under the control of the \nshareholders of the Bank ” or “ controlled by the Bank’s shareholders ”, e.g. 1.4.14 NBU list  {K3-\nD/68 P}, 1.7.14 NBU list  {K3-D/74 P}, 1.4.15 IFRS list {K3 -E/90P} ; and ( iii) in \nresponse to the NBU’s finding that the Bank failed properly to disclose information \non the owners of Triantal (D1 and Mr Bogolyubov)  {E8/137/2} , Bank employees \nnoted that this had always been “ displayed ” in the Bank’s IFRS statements {E7/282} . \nTriantal was included in IFRS lists from Jun 11 as a company “ under the control of the \nbank’s shareholders ” {K3 -E/13P/10}  (#192) . \n(11) “Lies to auditors”  \n346. During its oral openings and document presentation, the Bank developed a new angle on its related party thesis, namely that Mr Bogolyubov lied to PwC, EY and the NBU \n \n67 Tamersa, Tseris, Dampir, Favore, Melitas  \nAA4/6/108\n105 \n in relation to the Bank’s related party lists. E.g. , the Bank suggests that the NBU was \n“hoodwinked ”, and auditors lied to about Uniks and Dorteks as they were not declared \nas companies in which D1 and/or Mr Bogolyubov were interested {Day15/128:23} -\n129:15 {Day2/46:1 -7}, Bank Closing/343 {AA2/15/198} .

The Bank produced a \nhand- out analysing the Bank’s 2014 IFRS list to show what they say were omissions \nfrom the list which proved Mr Bogolyubov and D1 had “ lied” to PwC  {AA6/12}.  \n347. Given that it has been shown above (and accepted by Mr Luchaninov) that the Bank \nemployees were not seeking to hide Mr Bogolyubov’s interests from the NBU, it is \nunclear what the Court is meant to take from the proposition (if true) that inaccurate \nstateme nts were made to PwC, EY or the NBU at particular points in time.  \n348. At any rate, the Bank’s argument does not go anywhere.:  \n348.1  First, companies were sometimes not included in related party lists at one point \nin time (even if perhaps they should have been) but were then included later. Reasons for this were canvassed above. This can be seen from the Bank’s own hand-out {AA6/12} which shows that all but 11 companies they claim were \nwrongly included as non- related parties in 2014 were included  as related  parties  \nin 2015. Mr Bogolyubov  is said to have an interest in only five  of these , largely \nbased on non- contemporaneous evidence . The hand -out is also unreliable , \nomitting  that many of the companies were included as related parties  in NBU \nlists around this time  e.g. Gleris was added to the 1.7.15 NBU list as a “ Company \nwith substantial participation of the Bank ’s shareholders ” {K3-D/117P/2}  (#69)  and \nnot explaining the basis on which it is said  the companies should have been \nincluded in 2014, under the applicable test. \n348.2  S econdly , in relation to Uniks and Dorteks, it appears from the Luchaninov \nEmail that the employees responsible for compiling the NBU lists did not identify that D1 and/or Mr Bogolyubov held interests in them. Their interests in Uniks appear to have been identified by the Compliance Department only in Mar 16, at which point they considered Uniks was “ abandoned” {E13/51.1} \n{E13/51.02 } (#16) . By contrast, the employees responsible for compiling the \nIFRS list had identified this by 1.7.15 and Uniks and Dorteks were included in the list at that time as companies “ under the control of the Bank’s shareholders ” {K3-\nE/95P/25}  (#489, #494). \nAA4/6/109\n106 \n 348.3  Thirdly , there is no evidence that Mr Bogolyubov was involved in the \npreparation of the related party lists, save for signing an annual shareholders’ \nlist prepared by the Bank. Mr Luchaninov does not suggest he was involved. \n(12) Conclusions  \n349. It has been shown that the “shuffling” of borrowers, and the directors and \nbeneficiaries of shell companies was not designed to “hide” Mr Bogolyubov’s interests, \nbut to assist the Bank in complying with related party lending ratios. This in turn \nsupports the argument that the recycling scheme (a different kind of “shuffling”) was also employee -led and not a masterminded fraud. Moreover, it undermines the Bank’s \nsuggestion that Mr Bogolyubov must  own and control the various shell companies \nbeing shuffled as he must  be pulling the strings. In relation to related parties, it is clear \nthat he was not.  \nD. M R BOGOLYUBOV’S LACK OF INVOLVEMENT IN ANY ‘SCHEME’  \n350. There is such a lack of evidence of Mr Bogolyubov’s involvement in any ‘Scheme’ that \nthe Bank has been reduced to seeking to rely upon adverse inferences ( Section D1 ), \ngeneral allegations of “ suspicious ” behaviour ( Section D3 ) and evidence that is relevant \nonly to Mr Kolomoisky ( Section D4 ). None of this can outweigh the complete \nabsence of evidence of involvement "}

None of this can outweigh the complete \nabsence of evidence of involvement of Mr Bogolyubov in any of the actions said to comprise the ‘Scheme’. Indeed, such evidence as there is shows that Mr Bogolyubov \ndid not control the Bank ( Section D2 ), the entities said to be involved in the ‘Scheme’ \n(Section D5 ) or more importantly their relevant actions.  \nD1. A\nPPROACH TO THE EVIDENCE  \n351. The comments made in Mr Bogolyubov’s written opening68 regarding the approach to \nthe burden of proof, the appropriateness of drawing inferences of fraud and the relevant Ukrainian context in which the Bank’s allegations must be assessed are \nrepeated. For the reasons given below, Mr Bogolyubov submits that the  Bank has \nfailed to establish any complicity on his part in the alleged ‘Scheme’. On the contrary, \nthere is a complete absence of evidence that supports the Bank’s case.  \n \n68  D2 Opening/84 -96 {AA4/1/35} . \nAA4/6/110\n107 \n 352. The Bank has not adduced any witness testimony evidencing Mr Bogolyubov’s alleged \ninvolvement in the ‘Scheme’ and the documentary record is inconsistent with any such \ninvolvement. There is not one trace in the  over 35 ,000 documents in the trial bundle69 \nof Mr Bogolyubov directing , approving or having any knowledge of  the ‘Scheme’. Had \nhe been involved, it is inconceivable that this would not be reflected in the \ncontemporaneous documents.  The frequency with which others are named \ndemonstrates that involvement is invariably marked by comments in the available \nrecords.  \n353. In the absence of evidential support for its case, the Bank seeks to draw adverse inferences from Mr Bogolyubov’s decision not to give evidence at trial and alleged deficiencies in his disclosure. The inferences sought to be drawn by the Bank  should \nnot be drawn and  are addressed below. Even if it were appropriate to draw any \ninference s against Mr Bogolyubov, such inferences would be weak and incapable of \noutweighing the strong inference that he was not involved produced by the absence \nof any witness or documentary evidence supporting the Bank’s case. \n(1) Mr Bogolyubov’s decision not to give evidence at trial  \n354. The Bank sets great store by Mr Bogolyubov’s decision not to give evidence at trial. \nHowever, the absence of a witness cannot create an inference of guilt where no such \ninference would otherwise be justified. There must exist a case to answer before any inference arises from the absence of witness — \nWisniewski v Central Manchester \nHealth Authority  [1998] PIQR P323 at 340 {M3/0.1}: \n“(3)  There must, however, have been some evidence, however weak, adduced by the \nformer on the matter in question before the court is entitled to draw the desired \ninference: in other words, there must be a case to answer on that issue.”  \n355. For the reasons given below, the Bank has failed to establish a credible prima facie  case \nthat Mr Bogolyubov was involved in any wrongdoing. The inference which in fact \narises from the documentary record is that Mr Bogolyubov was not involved in the \nsupposed ‘Scheme’. Having failed to discharge its own burden of establishing a prima \nfacie case of wronging by Mr Bogolyubov, the Bank cannot rescue its claim by seeking \nadverse inferences from Mr Bogolyubov’s non- attendance at trial.  \n \n69  Including over 13,000 documents in the Bundle E chronological run and nearly 2,700 Skypes and instant \nmessages (Bundles K4 and K5).  \nAA4/6/111\n108 \n 356.

Further, the Court could not in any event safely infer that the reason Mr Bogolyubov \ndid not give evidence was because he feared that his claims of non -involvement in the \n‘Scheme’ would be shown to be false. Mr Bogolyubov’s election not to give evidence was made against a backdrop of considerable uncertainty and turmoil in Ukraine. The \nCourt can properly take the view, not least given developments  over the summer  \nconcerning Mr Kolomoisky, that there may be a number of reasons unconnected with \nthe prospect of being cross -examined by the Bank why Mr Bogolyubov elected not to \ngive evidence at trial.  \n357. Finally, even if Mr Bogolyubov had attended trial to be cross -examined, the reality of \ncases such as the present is that the Court will place the greatest weight on the documentary record. Evidence from Mr Bogolyubov, particularly where that evidence would have consisted of denials of involvement or knowledge of the relevant events, \nwould ultimately have been of subsidiary importance in the Court’s assessment given the well -established difficulties of ascertaining credibility via XX. Given the relatively \nlimited weight that would likely have been placed on his evidence had he attended, the \nabsence of such evidence cannot give rise to an inference that it would in fact have \nassisted, rather than harmed, the Bank’s case.  \n358. Accordingly, the Court should be very slow to draw any adverse inference against Mr Bogolyubov from his decision not to give evidence at trial . If any inference were  to be \ndrawn , it should be limited in scope and weight. \n(2) Absence of evidence from other individuals  \n359. The Bank also suggests that adverse inferences should be drawn against Mr Bogolyubov from his supposed failure to adduce witness evidence from a large cast of \nindividuals .\n70 However, t he Bank has not demonstrated that Mr Bogolyubov had any \nability to compel the individuals in question (save perhaps for Mr Anischenko) to give \nevidence on his behalf. \n360. Mr Dubilet:  There is no evidence  that Mr Bogolyubov had any ability to call Mr \nDubilet as a witness  and there is very little evidence of them even communicating post -\nNationalisation . Most of the evidence post -Nationalisation shows Mr Dubilet \n \n70  The Bank’s Written Opening/166 {AA2/1/74} contended  that a dverse inferences should arise from \nthe failure to call Mr Dubilet, Mr Novikov, Ms Gurieva, Mr Anischenko and Mr Melny k (as well, \nseemingly against D1 only as Mr Kazantsev, Ms Koryak and Mr Pugach). The Bank’s Written \nClosing/47(3) {AA2/15/33} adds Ms Markova to the list (but removes Mr Pugach).  \nAA4/6/112\n109 \n communicating with Mr Kolomoisky . Indeed, Mr Dubilet is hardly likely to have \nagreed to give evidence for Mr Bogolyubov in circumstances where Mr Bogolyubov \naccuses him of complicity in the ‘Scheme’.  \n361. M r Novikov: The mere  fact that Mr Novikov, via Primecap, provides corporate \nservices to Mr Bogolyubov’s companies  does not mean that Mr Bogolyubov controls \nthat individual. Nor does  the fact that Mr Novikov gave evidence for Mr Kolomoisky  \nin the Pinchuk proceedings demonstrate  that he would give evidence for Mr \nBogolyubov almost a decade later.  \n362. Ms  Gurieva:  The fact that she remained in contact with D1 post -Nationalisation does \nnot establish that Mr Bogolyubov could have called her as a witness. \n363. Mr Me lnyk: The fact that Mr Melnyk had an employment contract with Sunaltezza \nbetween 11.2017–01.2020 does not demonstrate that Mr Bogolyubov had any ability \nto compel him to give evidence at a trial some three years later.  \n364.

Ms  Gurieva:  The fact that she remained in contact with D1 post -Nationalisation does \nnot establish that Mr Bogolyubov could have called her as a witness. \n363. Mr Me lnyk: The fact that Mr Melnyk had an employment contract with Sunaltezza \nbetween 11.2017–01.2020 does not demonstrate that Mr Bogolyubov had any ability \nto compel him to give evidence at a trial some three years later.  \n364. Mr K azantsev, Ms Koryak:  The only basis for any inference of control  put forward by \nthe Bank is that Mr Kazantsev and Ms Koryak gave evidence  for D1 at the \ninterlocutory stage of these proceedings. This does not show that Mr Bogolyubov  \ncould exercise any control over them.  \n365. Ms  Markova:  The Bank has not set out the basis on which it contends that Mr \nBoglolyubov could have compelled her to give evidence. The Bank has not adduced \nany evidence that Ms Markova’s employment contract with Sunaltezza gave Mr \nBogolyubov any right to compel her to give evi dence.  \n366. A s to Mr Anischenko , the Bank has known that he would not be called as a witness \nsince the exchange of trial witness statements in No v 21, yet it was not until the Bank’s \nwritten opening that any suggestion was made that he  should have been tendered. Nor \nis it apparent (perhaps explaining why the Bank did not raise his absence earlier) that \nMr Anischenko would have any relevant  evidence to give. He was not an employee of \nthe Bank or otherwise involved in its operations during the relevant time period; his role focuses on administering Mr Bogolyubov’s personal assets.  There is no evidence \nof his involvement in the ‘Scheme’  and no reason to believe that he has any direct \nknowledge of who was involved in it . \nAA4/6/113\n110 \n (3) Mr Bogolyubov’s disclosure  \n367. The Bank also seeks to draw adverse inferences against Mr Bogolyubov from his \nalleged failure to retain and disclose documents. No such criticisms are justified and no adverse inferences properly arise.  \n368. First , a party is under no obligation to preserve documents prior to litigation being in \nreasonable contemplation.71 No adverse inference can be drawn against a person for \nnot retaining documents prior to litigation being in prospect.72 Less still can an \ninference be drawn against a person for not generating documents in the first place.  \n369. Accordingly, the Bank’s criticism of Mr Bogolyubov for supposedly taking steps “to \nlimit the documentary record he generated and kept”  is thoroughly misplaced. Mr Bogolyubov \nwas under no obligation to ensure that every conversation he ever had was minuted or \nto retain every mobile phone he ever possessed in case someone might one day bring proceedings against him. In any event, as the disclosure timeline for Mr Bogolyubov \n{AA6/20} demonstrates, he has produced documents from various repositories \nthroughout the relevant period for disclosure, contradicting any suggestion that he has \ndeliberately sought to destroy all records from this time. \n370. Similarly misplaced is the Bank’s suggestion that Mr Bogolyubov “cynically took advantage”  of the period between the Pinchuk and Tatneft proceedings to delete data. \nThe Bank accepts that Mr Bogolyubov was not under any obligation to preserve \ndocuments during this period (Bank Opening/178)  {AA2/1/77 } and there is no basis \nto suggest that he expected Tatneft to bring proceedings against him (indeed, Tatneft’s \nclaim was dismissed by Moulder J as being long out of time).

Second , the Bank’s other various suggestions that Mr Bogolyubov has failed to \ndisclose of documents within his control are misplaced and overstated. \n372. G eneral criticisms:  The Bank’s claim that Mr Bogolyubov’s disclosure has been “akin \nto squeezing blood out of a stone”  falls very wide of the mark.73 Over 800,000 unique \ndocuments were collected as part of Mr Bogolyubov’s primary disclosure exercise, of which approximately 150,000 were responsive to the agreed keywords and date \nranges.\n74 The fact that relatively few of these documents (approximately 5 ,000) were \nfound to be disclosable is indicative of Mr Bogolyubov ’s non- involvement in the key \nevents, rather than any failure to give proper disclosure. The Bank also cites the three \nspecific disclosure orders made against Mr Bogolyubov, but each of these orders was \nagreed by Mr Bogolyubov.75 They do not demonstrate any recalcitrance by him.  \n373. Historic mobile telephones:  The Bank ’s allegation  that Mr Bogolyubov breached \nlitigation holds in the Pinchuk and Tatneft proceedings by disposing of mobile phones \nwhile th ose proceedings were ongoing  is irrelevant to the question whether an adverse \ninference should be drawn in this claim (which could only arise from the deliberate destruction of documents once these  proceedings were in contemplation)  and in any \nevent incorrect .76 The date ranges for disclosure in the Pinchuk and Tatneft \nproceedings ended in Mar and Jun 13 respectively.77 Mr Bogolyubov was not required \nto retain documents generated after these dates78 and was therefore not subject to any \nduty of preservation in respect of such documents. Nor was Mr Bogolyubov required to retain devices which were collected and imaged/searched as part of his disclosure exercise in the Pinchuk Proceedings after they were returned by his then solicitors.\n79 \n \n73  Bank Opening/174 { AA2/1/76 }. \n74  See Mr Bogolyubov’s Disclosure Certificate, Appendix 1, ¶¶1 –13 {A4/32/14 -15} \n75  The order of 29.3.22 was by consent {A6/80} , as was the order of 10.10.22 {A6/97.1}. The order of \n25.6.21 {A6/63} was made pursuant to voluntary undertakings given by Mr Bogolyubov.  \n76  Bank Opening/174 { AA2/1/76 }. \n77  See Mr Bogolyubov’s Disclosure Certificate, ¶¶4 -6 {A4/32/4} \n78  Pursuant to the then applicable Practice Direction 31B ¶7, the duty to preserve documents was limited \nto documents that may be disclosable.

Post- 2017 iPhones:  There is nothing sinister or unbelievable about Mr Bogolyubov’s \nlongstanding practice of giving away his old iPhone to family members or friends each \ntime he upgraded his device .80 The Bank ’s speculation  (based simply  on iPhone release \ndates) that Mr Bogoly ubov must have given away three phones after the present  \nproceedings commenced ( and one phone while the Shulman proceedings were live)  \n(Bank Closing/253(3) (c) {AA2/15/142}) is just that: speculation. But it is any event \nmisplaced  so far as these proceedings are concerned  as from 2017 onwards Mr \nBogolyubov synced the contents of his old phone to his new phone when upgrading, \nso no data was lost after these proceedings commenced .81 \n375. Instant messages  (WhatsApp):  The Bank wrongly asserts that Mr Bogolyubov has \ndeleted his pre -2017 WhatsApp messages.82 There is no basis for any allegation of \ndeliberate destruction. Rather, messages prior to 2017 were simply not retained when Mr Bogolyubov upgraded his mobile telephone from time -to-time without (as was his \npractice prior to 2017)  transferring his old data {A4/32/9} . Again, Mr Bogolyubov \nwas not under any duty to retain such documents prior to litigation being in reasonable \ncontemplation and so no adverse inference arises. Further, some of Mr Bogolyubov’s \npre-2017 WhatsApp messages have in any event been disclosed fr om devices used by \nMr Anischenko (from 27.09.14 onwards)\n83 and Mr Kolomoisky (between 20.10.15–\n09.08.16)84, so the Court is far from bereft of Mr Bogolyubov’s pre- 2017 messages.  \n376. Instant messages  (Other):  The Bank’s claim that Mr Bogolyubov has failed to disclose \ninstant messages sent via Signal, Viber or Threema is also incorrect. Searches have \nbeen conducted for Signal, Viber and Threema messages on Mr Bogolyubov’s  and Mr \nAnischenko’s mobile phone s and all identified  available  messages have been \nreviewed.85 No messages were disclosed because none were relevant to the \nproceedings.  \n \n80  As set out in Mr Bogolyubov’s Disclosure Certificate {A4/32/9}  \n81  See Mr Bogolyubov’s Disclosure Certificate, Table 2 point 2 {A4/32/9} , describing the “syncing process \nthat Mr Bogolyubov has followed each time he has obtained a new iPhone since 2017.”  \n82  Bank Opening/76 {AA2/1/39} \n83  See the D2 Disclosure Timeline {AA6/20}  \n84  See bundle {K5 -A1/5} {K5 -A1/6}  \n85  See Mr Bogolyubov’s Supplemental Disclosure Certificate {A4/68/2}. As explained in Enyo’s letters \nof 26.09.22 ¶¶9– 13 {L/98.1/3} and 16.11.22 ¶7.1 {L/110.1/3}, due to an oversight Signal messages \nwere not collected when Mr Bogolyubov’s phone was imaged but subsequently a specific search was \nmade for such messages and none were found. This is consistent with Mr Bogolyubov’s explanation \nthat his use of Signal was limited: see Ellis1/82 –85 {H3/22/15}. \nAA4/6/116\n113 \n 377. Emails: The Bank’s criticisms regarding the collection of emails are overblown:  \n377.1  Emails have been collected and reviewed from the gbb2001@gmail.com and \ngennadiy.bb@gmail.com addresses via both images of those accounts taken for the purposes of Pinchuk Proceedings and requests (made voluntarily by Mr \nBogolyubov) for production by Google. As a result, emails sent to or from these accounts throughout the key period have been reviewed for disclosure.\n86 \nWhile the Bank’s claim that it is unbelievable that Mr Bogolyubov could have forgotten his login details for these accounts is devoid from reality (it being \nhardly uncommon to forget passwords), this is ultimately of little consequence \ngiven that document s from these"}

As a result, emails sent to or from these accounts throughout the key period have been reviewed for disclosure.\n86 \nWhile the Bank’s claim that it is unbelievable that Mr Bogolyubov could have forgotten his login details for these accounts is devoid from reality (it being \nhardly uncommon to forget passwords), this is ultimately of little consequence \ngiven that document s from these accounts have been collected and reviewed.  \n377.2  The Bank’s allegation that emails sent to or from the gennadiy.bb@gmail.com account before 25.02.16 were deleted after the conclusion of the Pinchuk \nProceedings\n87 is entirely speculative and undermined by the fact that emails \nfrom this time remained in the gbb2001@gmail.com account. In any event, no \nadverse inference can arise since Mr Bogolyubov was not under any litigation hold at the time the Bank suggests the deletion took place. Further, emails sent \nto or from the gennadiy.bb@gmail.com account between Jun 13 to Jun 14 are \nseparately available from the Pinchuk image and have been reviewed.  \n377.3  Finally, the fact that Mr Bogolyubov has been unable to access two historic and disused email accounts (gbb2001@mail.ru and Gennadiy.bb@gbbmail.com) \ndoes not evidence any wilful failure of disclosure. Neither account is now \naccessible and there is no basis  to believe that they would have contained any \nrelevant documents.\n88 \n378. PBC, Grizal and Sunaltezza documents:  The Bank complains about the delay in \nidentifying these entities as relevant custodians. Whatever the merits of the point as \n \n86  See the D2 Disclosure Timeline {AA6/20}  \n87  See Bank Opening/184(2) {AA2/1/80} \n88  Indeed, it appears that the gbb2001@mail.ru  account may never have existed: see Mr Bogolyubov’s \nSupplemental Disclosure Certificate ¶40.1 {A4/113/11}. Th e Gennadiy.bb@gbbmail.com  account was \ncreated for the purpose of the Pinchuk Proceedings and was not used by Mr Bogolyubov thereafter \n(though it appears that one or two emails may have been mistakenly sent to the account by others): see \nMr Bogolyubov’s Supplemental Disclosure Cert ificate ¶40.2 {A4/113/11}. \nAA4/6/117\n114 \n regards delay,89 it does nothing to establish that documents have been deliberately \nwithheld. Promptly upon becoming aware that these custodians might hold relevant \ndocuments, Mr Bogolyubov took steps to collect and review them. There is no \nevidence that documents held by these custodians have been destroyed ( deliberately \nor otherwise) . Any defects in the original disclosure process have been remedied.  The \nsuggestion that Mr Bogolyubov lied about his ability to access Mr Melnyk’s documents is not borne out as Mr Bogolyubov was not aware of his employment contract with Sunaltezza when resisting the Bank’s application in Nov 22. \n379. Historical c all records, meeting notes, diaries: The Bank has not established any basis \nto conclude that such documents must have existed, been retained until at least the \nend of 2016 and then deliberately destroyed in contemplation of these proceedings. The natural inference is that any such documents (if any were created) were simply not \nretained and disposed of in the ordinary course of business.  \n380. T\nhird , even if the Bank could establish any deficiencies in Mr Bogolyubov’s disclosure, \nit does not follow that it should be inferred in general terms that documents must exist \nwhich are contrary to Mr Bogolyubov’s case. The correct approach in such \ncircumstanc es is described in Aegean Baltic Bank S.A. v Renzlor Shipping Limited  [2020] \nEWHC 2851 (Comm) at [34] {M3/5.1}  (and followed by Moulder J in PJSC Tatneft v \nBogolyubov & Ors  [2021] EWHC 411 (Comm) at [448]  {M3/6/102} ): \n“…It is one thing to draw an inference that the evidence of a missing witness would or \nmight be adverse.

{"start": 315000, "text": "re contrary to Mr Bogolyubov’s case. The correct approach in such \ncircumstanc es is described in Aegean Baltic Bank S.A. v Renzlor Shipping Limited  [2020] \nEWHC 2851 (Comm) at [34] {M3/5.1}  (and followed by Moulder J in PJSC Tatneft v \nBogolyubov & Ors  [2021] EWHC 411 (Comm) at [448]  {M3/6/102} ): \n“…It is one thing to draw an inference that the evidence of a missing witness would or \nmight be adverse. It is another to speculate that there exists a document which is adverse. Absent at least a reason to believe that such a document does exist, this wou ld \nbe going too far. Nonetheless, in considering the documentary record in the trial bundle, I must always remember that that record is incomplete, that the Defendants have not furnished their disclosure and that the Bank and the Court have been prevented,  by the \nDefendants' conduct, from finding out whether documents do exist which might be adverse to the Defendants' case. At the very least, I would expect the benefit of any \ndoubt to be firmly in the Bank's favour.”  \n381. Therefore, in the absence of any proper reason to believe that there exist specific \ndocuments undermining Mr Bogolyubov’s case which he has failed to disclose, it would be inappropriate to draw any inference that such documents exist. Rather, if \n \n89  As has been explained in correspondence, Grizal and Sunaltezza  were not originally identified as \ncustodians because they were not referred to in the pleadings and were not keywords for disclosure (¶4 \nof Enyo’s letter of 8.09.23 {L/196/1})  and because Mr Bogolyubov was not aware of the identities of \nthe persons who entered into employment contracts with Sunaltezza so could not have appreciated \ntheir relevance (¶2 -5 of Enyo’s letter of 23.09.23 {L/210/1}). Upon the relevance of Grizal and \nSunaltezza becoming apparent, urgent steps have been taken to collect and review their documents as \nexplained in detail in Enyo’s letter of 23.10.23 {L/264/1}. \nAA4/6/118\n115 \n (contrary to Mr Bogolyubov’s submissions) the Court finds that there has been some \nfailure of disclosure, the Court will bear this in mind when considering the available documentary record. \n382. However, in the circumstances of this case, where there has been considerable \ndisclosure both of the Bank’s contemporaneous records (including vast quantities of \ncontemporaneous Skype messages) and from Mr Bogolyubov’s custodians, any such gaps in the documentary record would be de minimis . If Mr Bogolyubov was involved \nin the ‘Scheme’, it is inconceivable that this would not be reflected in the documents \nwhich have been disclosed, not least given the level of detail revealed by them about \nthe operation of the ‘Scheme’ and who was responsible for its approval and implementation. On the contrary, as explained further below, the documents persuasively demonstrate that Mr Bogolyubov was not involved. \nD2. M\nR BOGOLYUBOV DID NOT CONTROL  THE BANK \n383. At the time of its founding in 1992 and over its early years, Mr Bogolyubov was involved in the Bank and it was a source of pride for him {E1/92/7} . However, in the \nearly 2000s his centre of interests shifted. He  moved to the UK in 2009 {AA1/4/1} \nand developed other business interests, in particular ConsMin, one of the largest manganese ore producers in the world by volume {E18/172/26} . His CVs show his \nmultitude of interests e.g.  {E18/235.2} . Although he remained a shareholder in the \nBank and member of its Supervisory Board, his approach was ‘hands -off’. His \ninvolvement over the relevant period comprised mostly  actions he had to take as a  \nSupervisory Board member or shareholder , or interactions as a client. F rom 1.7.14, Mr \nBogolyubov agreed with Mr Kolomoisky  that he would step back from the Bank, \nacting from that point on Mr Kolomoisky’s instructions and decreasing  his \nshareholding with a view  to stepping out of the picture entirely .  \n384.

This is the relevant context in which to assess whether Mr Bogolyubov had anything to do with what the Bank alleges  was going on. There is no evidence that he controlled  \nthe day -to-day actions of the Bank or knew of any of the relevant decisions . In this \ncontext, no knowledge of or involvement in the ‘Scheme’ can be inferred.  Further, \nthere is no basis for any inference that Mr Bogolyubov had any control over Mr \nKolomoisky. To the contrary, Mr Bogolyubov agreed from 1.7.14 to act on Mr \nKolomoisky’s instructions. Moreover, the known character of Mr Kolomoisky has to \nAA4/6/119\n116 \n be factored into the question of whether any inference adverse to  Mr Bogolyubov  can \nproperly be drawn  from Mr Kolomoisky’s conduct.  \n(1) The Bank’s witness evidence: baseless “a ssumptions”   \n385. Two of the Bank’s witnesses (Mr Luchaninov and Ms Lozytska) included \n“assumptions” in their witness statements as to Mr Bogolyubov’s control of the Bank \nthrough its  top management . Both  accepted in XX  that these assumptions were not \nbased on their personal knowledge . They were  therefore  included despite their non-\ncompliance with the statement of truth90 and unfortunately bear the hallmarks of \ndrafting  by lawyers . They bear no weight and can be ignored.  \n(i) Mr Luchaninov \n386. The relevant assumptions are at Luchaninov/14 & 17 {B1/3/5 -6}:  \nParagraph 14  {B1/3/5 }  \nThe Head of BOK was Tetiana Gurieva, a member of the Bank’s Management Board. \nBecause of her senior position within the Bank, my assumption at the time was that Ms Gurieva would have received instructions directly from the Bank’s former owners, Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov. …  \n Paragraph 17  {B1/3/6}  \nAs I have explained, Mr Novikov was the Head of the Bank’s Investment Business and a member of the Bank’s Management Board. Given his senior position within the Bank, my assumption at the time was that Mr Novikov would have received instructions directly f rom Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov. An example of the central role that \nMr Novikov played is that he supported them in litigation that they were party to, including a claim brought against them personally by Victor Pinchuk. I recall, for \ninstance, that Mr  Novikov was in charge of searching for and collecting documents held \nby the Bank that were relevant to Mr Pinchuk’s claim.  \n387. Mr Luchaninov’s evidence in XX showed he had no basis for these  “assumptions” as \nto how instructions were given.  \n387.1  He accepted that he had never met or even seen  D2: \nQ.   You did not, however, report to Mr Bogolyubov who I represent, did you?  \nA.   No, I did not report to Mr Bogolyubov.  \nQ.   Have you ever met him?  \nA.   I have not ever met Mr Bogolyubov, my Lord.  \nQ.   Have you ever seen him in the Bank?  \nA.  No, I didn't remember such a fact.  I have not seen him personally.  \n{Day9/53:18- 25} \n \n90  “ I understand that the purpose of this witness statement is to set out matters of fact of which I have \npersonal knowledge. …This witness statement sets out only my personal knowledge and recollection, \nin my own words.…I have not been asked or encouraged by anyone to include in this statement anything that is not my own account, to the best of my ability and recollection, of events I witnessed or \nmatters of which I have personal knowledge. ” \nAA4/6/120\n117 \n 387.2  He accepted that the assumption in Luchaninov/14  was not based on any \npersonal knowledge:  \nQ.

You have not witnessed and you have no personal knowledge of the relationship \nbetween Ms Gurieva and Mr Bogolyubov, do you?  \nA.   My Lord, may I explain?  The fact was that the unit that serviced the Bank customers was managed by Ms Gurieva and it was a specialised unit for \nservicing the strategic Bank clients and considering the fact that this specific unit communicated with their s trategic customers and possessed \nknowledge of beneficiary owners, so this business unit was also in charge \nand in possession of this information.  And th at's why I came to \nconclusion that this unit, managed by Ms Gurieva, was taking \ninstructions from Mr Bogolyubov directly.  \nQ.   You have not witnessed and you have no personal knowledge of the relationship between Ms Gurieva and Mr Bogolyubov, do you?  \nA.   No, my Lord, I have not witnessed that personally. However, while \nworking in the Bank, I heard the words like , \"Dmitry, you are not so \nlucky, but we who worked in the Bank longer than you remember the times when Messrs Bogolyubov and Kolomoisky visited the b ank's \noffice\", but personally I hav en't seen Mr Bogolyubov.  \n                                                                   {Day9/55:6} - 56:2 \n387.3  He accepted the same of the assumption in Luchaninov/17: \nQ.   I accept you've communicated with Mr Novikov.  You have not seen or heard \nhim speaking to Mr Bogolyubov?  \nA.   It's correct, my Lord, I have not ever seen or heard Mr Novikov speaking \nto Mr Bogolyubov .  \nQ.  Why have you made this assumption rather than stated what you've known or \nseen?  \nA.  Well, my Lord, it was an assumption based on the fact that our compliance \nunit was involved together with Mr Novikov to help to separate some \ndocument related to Mr Kolomoisky, Mr Bogolyubov and also some \ncompanies which have been considered in the proceedings mentioned in \nthis paragraph.                                                                  {Day9/58:1 9} -59:5 \n387.4  Mr Luchaninov’s assumptions in relation to Mr Bogolyubov ’s and Mr \nNovikov’s relationship were based on no personal knowledge .  \n388. Indeed, Mr Luchaninov’s  evidence in XX showed just how distant Mr Bogolyubov \nwas from day -to-day operations at  the Bank:  \nQ.  You told us about your colleagues in the Bank saying to you , \"Remember the times \nwhen Mr Bogolyubov and indeed Mr Kolomoisky would vi sit\", that was before 2010, \nwasn't it?  \nA.  Well, maybe.  As far as I remember, it may have been about that time .  \nQ.  It must have been before your time which starts in 200491 because you were talking \nabout those who had worked at the Bank longer than you.  \nA.  Sorry, can you phrase your question, please, because ...  \nQ.  Certainly.  You told us about people who had worked at the Bank for longer than you \nhad -- you started in 2004 -- as being the people who would say to you, \"Oh, you \n \n91   Mr Luchaninov joined the Bank in 2004: Luchaninov/8 { B1/3/4 } \nAA4/6/121\n118 \n weren't there the times that Mr Bogolyubov came\", so I'm suggesting actually the times \nhe was seen visiting were well before 2010, probably before you joined the Bank?  \nA.

The relevant assumption is at Lozytska/15 {B1/6/5}  \nStructurally, BOK formed part of the Bank’s head office. In practice, therefore, Ms Gurieva, as the head of BOK, reported to the Chairman of the Bank, Oleksandr \nDubilet. Although I had no direct knowledge of this, given their responsibilities at the \nBank, I assumed at the time that Mr Dubilet and Ms Gurieva, as well as other senior \nmanagers such as Timur Novikov (the head of the Investment Business), Vladimir Yatsenko (the head of the Corporate VIP Business) and Liubov Chmona (the head of the Industrial and Commercial Enterprise Budgeting Business (the “Budgeting \nBusiness”)), would have had close relationships with the former shareholders of the Bank – Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov.  \n390. Ms Lozytska  also accepted in XX that this was based on no direct evidence or personal \nknowledge: \nQ.   You have no direct evidence or personal knowledge to back the assumption you have stated there, do you?  \nA.   My Lord, in this paragraph what I'm saying is that I believe that the former shareholders of the Bank had a close relationship with the heads of the various businesses.  These heads of businesses that I listed here were members of the management board of the Bank. They reported directly to the chairman of the board, Mr Dubilet.  Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov were members of the \nsupervisory board.  Based on that, I'm saying that they had a direct relationship \nwith them.  \nQ.  So let's just take it in stages.  You agree that you have no direct knowledge of their \ninterpersonal relationships?  \nA.  Not directly.  I have no direct knowledge of that.  I'm assuming that that is a \nfact.  \nQ.  And your assumption is based upon the structure of the Bank's management \ncommittees and supervisory board; is that what it's based on?  \nA.   Yes.                                                                                           {Day10/6:22} -7:16 \n(2) No witness evidence on control  \n391.

Ms Packhachuk’s post -Nationalisation evidence of \nsupposed “loyalty” is dealt with in Section  D2(8) below. The other witness evidence \nreferred to by the Bank  (Bank Closing/144) {AA2/15/90}  does not relate to Mr \nBogolyubov’s supposed control of the Bank. It  is necessary therefore to consider the \nissue by reference to the documentary evidence.  \nAA4/6/122\n119 \n (3) Mr Bogolyubov’s involvement in the Bank over time  qua Supervisory Board \nmember  \n392. Mr Bogolyubov  was Chair of the Supervisory Board from 2000  until Apr 15, during \nwhich period the other members were D1 and Mr Martynov . Mr Bogolyubov ’s role \non the Supervisory Board was limited and formal. F rom 1.7.14, Mr Bogolyubov agreed \nto exercise his powers on the Supervisory Board at D1’s direction.  \n393. The Bank does not say that any acts comprising the ‘Scheme ’ were made known to, \ntaken  or authorised by the Supervisory Board. The only relevant act in which it  was \ninvolved was  approving the Asset Transfer, alleged to be part of the ‘ cover -up’.  \n(i) General role o f the S upervisory Board \n394. The functions of the Supervisory Board are set out in the  Law of Banks, art .39 \n{C2/29/4} , the Bank’s  articles of association , art.9  {C1/214 /12} and the Bank’s \nSupervisory Board Regulations {C1/215}. In summary, the Supervisory Board \nperform ed an oversight, controlling function, generally making high level decisions  \nsuch as on the Bank’s strategic plan, lending policy, budget, members of the \nManagement Board, organisational structure and compliance . As stated in art.9.1 “ The \nSup"}
{"start": 329000, "text": " The functions of the Supervisory Board are set out in the  Law of Banks, art .39 \n{C2/29/4} , the Bank’s  articles of association , art.9  {C1/214 /12} and the Bank’s \nSupervisory Board Regulations {C1/215}. In summary, the Supervisory Board \nperform ed an oversight, controlling function, generally making high level decisions  \nsuch as on the Bank’s strategic plan, lending policy, budget, members of the \nManagement Board, organisational structure and compliance . As stated in art.9.1 “ The \nSupervisory Board does not partic ipate in the Bank’s current management ” {C1/214/13} . \n395. The Supervisory Board minutes show it making high level decisions, such as approving \nprocedural codes, appointing Management Board members and approving financial \nrecovery plans. Minutes covering the relevant period are  at {K1/7} - {K1/209} . There \nare 27 sets of minutes for 2013, 37 for 2014, 53 for 2015 and 81 for 2016. All 2016  \nminutes state that decisions were taken by absentee polling {Day2/148:7- 9}. The \nminutes are generally brief and do not record discussion.  \n396. The Bank submits that Mr Bogolyubov’s position that his role on the Supervisory \nBoard was akin to a rubber stamp is inconsistent with his own witness statement at Bogolyubov4/59- 60, which they say  “said something approaching the opposite ” \n{Day2/142:8- 14}. This is misleading by omission. Mr Bogolyubov ’s complete \nevidence on this point is at Bogolyubov4/ 51- 61 {B2/11/12- 14} and is consistent with \nhis current position.  \n(ii) Role of the Supervisory Board in signing loans \n397. The Supervisory Board was in theory obliged to approve related party loans over USD500k {C1/215/5}  and general loans over USD 2m {Day9/61:7- 10}. However, it \ndoes not appear that this was done in practice. In particular: \nAA4/6/123\n120 \n 397.1  There is no documentary evidence of it  approving such loans.  \n397.2  To the contrary, Skype  messages between Bank employees  state that Mr \nBogolyubov got “ tired” of signing loans  after 2010 and that Mr Dubilet had \nbeen approving the loans instead {K6/16.1/5 -8} {K6/23} . In XX , Mr \nLuchaninov claimed that  he did not know that the Supervisory Board  had not \napproved loans over USD2m  since 2010 {Day9/61:11 -12}. This is s urprising \nas he was responsible for ensuring compliance .  \n397.3  Mr Luchaninov was  aware that the NBU had made findings that loans to \nmanagers were not being properly approved by the Supervisory Board \n{Day9/61:13- 20}. The NBU stated in its audit report dated 14.8.14 that the \nBank had issued loans to three of its management staff without the requisite \nSupervisory Board approval {E4/276/12- 13}. Mr Luchaninov accepted that \nan emai l from him to Mr Dubilet of 5.8.14 {E4/237.1}  asking for backdated \njoint minutes to be signed by Mr Bogolyubov to confirm the issuance of one of these loans (to Ms Shmalchenko) was likely in response to the NBU inspectors pointing out the lack of approval {Day9/67:3- 9}. He suggested a \nsigned minute was  obtained from Mr Bogolyubov albeit that he could not \nproperly recall {Day9/67:1} -68:12; however, no such minute has been \ndisclosed by the Bank and it is likely that this was not in fact obtained as the NBU’s final audit report post-dated Mr Luchaninov’s email to Mr Dubilet.  \n(iii) Know\nledge and supervision of the Supervisory Board \n398. Indeed, the NBU found in its report  that, as well as failing to sign loans, the \nSupervisory Board “ does not conduct regular assessment of the effectiveness and caution of the \nactions of the Management Board ” and, in turn, that the Management Board “ does not submit \ntimely, meaningful, accurate or complete reports on the management of significant risks and the methods of control over these risks to the Supervisory Board ” {E4/276/12} . It concluded that there \nwas “ insufficient awareness of the Supervisory Board  about the risks inherent in the Bank’s \nactivities ”, in particular that “ the Supervisory Board is not fully informed about the"}
{"start": 332500, "text": "eness and caution of the \nactions of the Management Board ” and, in turn, that the Management Board “ does not submit \ntimely, meaningful, accurate or complete reports on the management of significant risks and the methods of control over these risks to the Supervisory Board ” {E4/276/12} . It concluded that there \nwas “ insufficient awareness of the Supervisory Board  about the risks inherent in the Bank’s \nactivities ”, in particular that “ the Supervisory Board is not fully informed about the risks that create \na load on the Bank’s financial standing ” {E4/276/1 -2}.  \n399. The Bank claimed that the statement in the Bank’s 2013 Corporate Ethics Code – “We \nhave ethical business practices that are followed by everyone ” – rebutted the suggestion that Mr \nBogolyubov could have been ignorant of the relevant conduct comprising the \n‘Scheme’ and  that there was any laissez faire attitude in the Ukrainian financial system \nAA4/6/124\n121 \n at the time { Day2/137: 17} -138:25. It also relied upon the Bank being a systemic bank \n“highly regulated ” by the NBU {Day2/138:21} - 140:17. \n400. This is  contradicted by the NBU’s own reports  which conclude that the Supervisory \nBoard was not kept properly informed and was not properly involved in supervision \nof the Bank. Risk factors in the Ukrainian banking system more generally, in particular \nweaknesses in corporate governance, are recorded in the Bank’s Eurobond Prospectus \n{E1/255/30- 48} (see esp. p.48), a section  of the Prospectus ignored by the Bank. \n401. The Bank’s new argument is that  it can be inferred  that Mr Bogolyubov directed \nwrongdoing on the basis that he was the addressee  (as Chair of the Supervisory Board)  \nof the NBU’s 2014 Report , signed off (as Chair of the Supervisory Board) on the \nperformance of the Management Board  and “ would have ” seen the NBU’s 2016 report  \n(Bank Closing/155- 157) {AA2/15/95- 96}. This  is hopeless. None of these examples \nshows he had any knowledge of wrongdoing at the Bank and all post- date Mr \nBogolyubov’s agreement with D1 of 1. 7.14, after which point he stepped back from \nthe Bank, exercising his powers on the Supervisory Board at D1’s direction.  \n(4) Mr Bogolyubov’s involvement in the Bank over time qua shareholder  \n402. The Bank does not say that any duties were owed  by Mr Bogolyubov  qua shareholder \nor that any acts done in his capacity as shareholder are relevant to liability. Rather, it \nclaims  his shareholding and powers as shareholder evidence his control of the Bank.  \n403. Again, there is no evidence that Mr Bogolyubov used his shareholding or status as a \nshareholder to exercise day -to-day control of the Bank. To the contrary, the evidence \nsuggests that he was not heavily involved with the Bank in this capacity, in particular as compared with Mr Kolomoisky , and especially from 1.7.14, when he  agreed to vote \nhis shareholding at Mr Kolomoisky ’s direction: see Section D2( 5).  \n(i) Theoretical powers as a shareholder \n404. The Bank’s  Articles,  Charter and the Law on Banks  art.38 list the powers held by the \ngeneral meeting, with the Charter (art.9) listing the general meeting as the “ supreme \nmanagement body of the Bank ” {C1/211/3} {K1/228/14}  {C9.3/2/9} . It is true that the \nshareholders theoretically had substantial power, and this was recorded as a risk factor \nin the Bank’s Eurobond Prospectus {E1/255/57} {Day2/148:21} - 149:22. However, \nthe key is whether, and if so how, any power was in fact exercised. T he Bank points to \nno relevant exercises of shareholder power  by Mr Bogolyubov , relying for the most \nAA4/6/125\n122 \n part on voting through nominees in general shareholder meetings: Bank Closing/142 -\n143 {AA2/15/89} .  \n(ii) Changes to t he Bank’s Charter  \n405. The Bank claimed that, in 2013 and 2014, the shareholders in general meeting “ ie D1 \nand D2 ” approved a version of the Bank ’s charter which gave the Supervisory Board \nor general meeting exclusive competence  to decide whether t"}
{"start": 336000, "text": "T he Bank points to \nno relevant exercises of shareholder power  by Mr Bogolyubov , relying for the most \nAA4/6/125\n122 \n part on voting through nominees in general shareholder meetings: Bank Closing/142 -\n143 {AA2/15/89} .  \n(ii) Changes to t he Bank’s Charter  \n405. The Bank claimed that, in 2013 and 2014, the shareholders in general meeting “ ie D1 \nand D2 ” approved a version of the Bank ’s charter which gave the Supervisory Board \nor general meeting exclusive competence  to decide whether to bring proceedings \nagainst the Bank’s management bodies (including the shareholders, Supervisory Board \nand Management Board) , suggesting that they did this to give themselves “ immunity ” \nand a “ legal barrier ” against the Bank being able to bring proceedings against them  \n{Day17/44:23} -51:18. This is pure speculation by the Bank. The Bank has not shown \nthat this provision was unusual at the time  or demonstrated that it has the suggested \neffect . Moreover,  there is no evidence that Mr Bogolyubov knew of the change, let \nalone that he instigated it. In any event , the Bank’s suggestion that Mr Bogolyubov  \nchanged t his provision to creat e a barrier to being sued does not make sense if the \nBank is correct  that the Management Board was controlled by Mr Bogoly ubov and D1 \nand up to its neck in fraud.  \n(iii) Mr Bogolyubov’s role in the asset transfer \n406. Mr Bogolyubov accepts that he agreed to transfer some of his assets to the Bank to \nshore it up. The Bank relies upon many emails, generally involving Mr Anischenko, as \nshowing that Mr Bogolyubov  was involved in the asset transfer e.g. {E12/215} \n{E13/32.01M} {E13/181} {E13/183} {E14/303.1} {E14/303.2} . However, t hese \nshow nothing more than that Mr Bogolyubov  agreed to transfer assets to the Bank , as \nhe accepts , and that he delegated the detail to Mr Anischenko.  \n407. The Bank accuse d Mr Bogolyubov of being “coy” about his involvement in the asset \ntransfer at Bogolyubov4/118 {Day3/86:1 -7}. The Bank refers to only one paragraph \nof the relevant section of Mr Bogolyubov’s witness evidence : the complete section is \nBogolyubov4/114- 118 {B2/11/28 -29}. Mr Bogolyubov’s witness statement accepts \nthat he agreed to help in contributing assets to the Bank, but that he was not involved \nin the details of what was discussed. This is wholly consistent with what the documents \nshow as to his limited involvement.  \n408. The Bank also suggest s that the fact that  Mr Bogolyubov  did not object or protest to \nthe idea of transferring his assets, or say “What on earth has been going on? ”, shows that \nhe knew what had been happening in the Bank {Day3/86:18- 23}. This is pure \nAA4/6/126\n123 \n speculation by the Bank as to what was or was not said. However, the fact that the \nBank had a capital shortfall would not have been  a surprise. NBU reports over many \nyears had  concluded that the Bank’s financial condition was “ unsatisfactory ”, pointing \nto the Bank’s failure to comply with capital ratios and problems regarding the \nmanagement of the Bank and its lending portfolios  e.g. {E8/234/3}  {E8/139} . The \nneed to shore up the Bank’s balance sheet did not come out of the blue. \n409. As the Bank now appears to have accepted, it was D1 who was “ involved in the detail of \nthe Asset Transfer ” (Bank Closing /357(5)) {AA2/15/216 }, with Mr Bogolyubov only \ninvolved to the extent that he agreed to transfer assets to the Bank. There is no \nevidence to suggest that Mr Bogolyubov was involved in inflating asset values and the only supposed motivation proffered by the Bank (that “ they would thereby minimise the \nother financial contributions that the NBU was requiring them to make to the Bank”: ibid.) does \nnot make sense vis -à-vis Mr Bogolyubov where, per Ms Rozhkova’s evidence, the NBU \nwas not even asking  Mr Bogolyubov to give a personal g uarantee.  \n(iv) Mr Bogolyubov’s i nvolvement with the NBU  and restructuring \n410.

{"start": 339500, "text": "ed in inflating asset values and the only supposed motivation proffered by the Bank (that “ they would thereby minimise the \nother financial contributions that the NBU was requiring them to make to the Bank”: ibid.) does \nnot make sense vis -à-vis Mr Bogolyubov where, per Ms Rozhkova’s evidence, the NBU \nwas not even asking  Mr Bogolyubov to give a personal g uarantee.  \n(iv) Mr Bogolyubov’s i nvolvement with the NBU  and restructuring \n410. Mr Bogolyubov ’s was involved  as a shareholder in the restructuring process  with the \nNBU. In relation to this, it is telling what he did not  do. In particular, it  was D1 that \ntook the lead in relation to the transformation: the Bank says that D1 “ directed ” it \n{Day16/67:12} . Ms Rozhkova accepted in XX that Mr Bogolyubov was not involved \nin the negotiations with the NBU, which were led by Mr Kolomoisky:  \n410.1  “It's correct, my Lord.  Mr Bogolyubov was not present in our meetings with Mr Kolomoisky \nwhen we discussed about the situation around the Bank.” {Day9/1:14- 16}; “he did not \ntake part in our discussion ” {Day9/10:22} . \n410.2  His lack of involvement was such that until the beginning of Oct  16, when Mr \nBogolyubov was to meet with the NBU, Ms Rozhkova did not have his phone number and had not met him or directly communicated with him about any \npart of the negotiation between the NBU and the Bank  {Day9/40:4- 20}. She \nwas not aware of any meetings having taken place between Mr Bogolyubov and \nthe NBU before Oct  16 {Day9/42:15- 21}.  \n410.3  Although Ms Rozhkova asserted many times that Mr Kolomoisky told her that \nsome steps in the restructuring  would have to be negotiated or discussed with \nMr Bogolyubov {Day9/1:20- 22}, there is no evidence that Mr Kolomoisky in \nAA4/6/127\n124 \n fact did this. The only documentary evidence shows Mr Kolomoisky \ninstructing Mr Bogolyubov to sign the Sep 16 letter to the NBU.  \n411. Further, Mr Bogolyubov  was in fact unwilling to provide a personal guarantee to the \nNBU in relation to the restructuring . Ms Rozhkova ultimately accepted  that she was \naware that Mr Bogolyubov was not taking any active interest i n the Bank and did not \nwish to have any ongoing financial commitment to it :  \nQ.   The reality is that you, Ms Rozhkova, had known since you took over or took up your \npost with the NBU that Mr Bogolyubov was taking no active interest in the Bank and wished to have no ongoing financial commitment to it.  You knew that, didn't you?  \nA.   Yes, my Lord, I know it, but Mr Bogolyubov was a majority shareholder.  His stake before nationalisation was probably a little bit more than 40%. According to the Ukrainian law, if acting or inacting of the shareholders led Bank to insolvency, they should carry full responsibility for it independently of the extent of their involvement.                                                              {Day9/47:4 -15} \n412. Although Mr Bogolyubov (as Chair of the Supervisory Board) and Mr Dubilet (as \nChair of the Management Board) sent letters to the NBU in early 2015 seeking stabilisation loans, and promising a guarantee from the shareholders in support e.g. \n{E7/307.01} , it was in fact only Mr Kolomoisky who provided a guarantee {K1/4/99} \n{Day9/1:17} -3:16 . \n413. Ms Rozhkova’s acceptance  was a U-turn from  her previous refusal to agree that Mr \nBogolyubov was in fact unwilling to provide a personal guarantee to the NBU, at least before Oct 16. Ms Rozhkova maintained that the NBU simply had not felt the need \nto ask Mr Bogolyubov for a guarantee  even though she accepted that the NBU’s \nregulations obliged it to ask for guarantees from both shareholders  {E8/248/2} \n{E8/248/6}  {Day9/13:20- 23}. Her suggested explanations were divergent and \ninconsistent , including that ( i) Mr Bogolyubov was not asked for a guarantee as he was \nnot in the country: {Day9/3:20} -4:11  (later contradicted by Ms Rozhkova’s evidence \nthat she  was only informed that Mr Bogolyubov was abroad later {Day9/24:1 -2"}

These claims were made in the face of  clear evidence that the NBU did turn its mind \nto the question of personal guarantees and requested them only from D1 , namely : \n414.1  the NBU’s letter of 11.12.15 {E12/103}  requiring the Bank to refinance in the \nsum of UAH 113.1bn and its letter of 21.1.16 which asked the Bank to “ finalize \nthe plans for capitalization before 25.01.2016 taking into account the possibility of…[inter \nalia]…shareholders’ contributions and other measures ” {E12/188/3} ; \n414.2  the Bank’s letter to the NBU  of 29.1.16 {E12/209} offering  a promise of a \ncontribution only from Mr Kolomoisky in an amount which Ms Rozhkova \naccepted was not enough to cover the shortfall {Day9/6:22} - 10:10 ; \n414.3  the NBU’s letter of 10.2.16 {E12/271}  stating  that the Bank’s restructuring \nplan was unacceptable for multiple reasons including that “ There is no duly \nexecuted letter of guarantee from the Bank’s shareholder ” {Day9/10:23} - 12:23 .  \n415. The true explanation for the NBU’s behaviour, as Ms Rozhkova in the end accepted  \n{Day9/47:4- 15}, was that Mr Bogolyubov was in fact unwilling to give a personal \nguarantee and was in fact no longer actively involved  in the Bank.  \n416. The only step of any significance taken by Mr Bogolyubov in the restructuring was the signing (at D1’s direction) in Sep 16 of a joint shareholder letter to the NBU \n{E15/272} {E18/177} . This was the first time that Mr Bogolyubov had been asked by \nthe NBU to be involved in the process {Day 9/35:6} -36:22. As Ms Rozhkova \nexplained, this was an NBU requirement: “ Yes, we required that the last letter should be signed \nby both of the shareholders because this letter shows us the choice, the own choice, of the issu e of the \nshareholders, how they want Bank should be safe or operated in future .” {Day9/37:16} - 37:20. \n417. Ms Rozhkova’s evidence in XX was  that Mr Bogolyubov was effectively put in an \nimpossible position, forcing him to sign this letter: in her own words “ Sign or Bank will \n[be] declare [d] insolvent ” {Day9/46:19}  (see similarly  {Day9/42:22} -45:8). This was in \nstark contradiction to the  evidence in her witness statement : “I was not personally involved \nin the events that led to Mr Bogolyubov signing the letter, but have no reason to believe that he was 'forced' to do so, by the NBU or otherwise .” Rozhkova1/66 {B1 /18/19} . \n418. The only significant step taken by Mr Bogolyubov after this point was to sign the Dec 16 nationalisation letter to the Ukrainian government. Ms Rozhkova explained that \nAA4/6/129\n126 \n this was also something that Mr Bogolyubov had to sign for nationalisation to take \nplace {Day9/49:11 -17}"}
{"start": 346500, "text": "as not personally involved \nin the events that led to Mr Bogolyubov signing the letter, but have no reason to believe that he was 'forced' to do so, by the NBU or otherwise .” Rozhkova1/66 {B1 /18/19} . \n418. The only significant step taken by Mr Bogolyubov after this point was to sign the Dec 16 nationalisation letter to the Ukrainian government. Ms Rozhkova explained that \nAA4/6/129\n126 \n this was also something that Mr Bogolyubov had to sign for nationalisation to take \nplace {Day9/49:11 -17}.  \n419. Thus, Mr Bogolyubov was involved only where this was a requirement or where he \nwas put under great pressure.  \n(5) Deeds of Indemnity and Waiver  \n420. The point of greatest significance in relation to Mr Bogolyubov’s alleged control of the Bank is his entry in spring 2015 into the Deeds of Indemnity and Waiver. As described at D2 Opening/107 -113 {AA4/1/42}, the Deeds recorded an agreement \nmade between D1 and Mr Bogolyubov  of around 1.7.14 . Mr Bogolyubov  entered into \nagreements  with D1 {E9/172L/5} {E10/28} , Mr Dubilet {E10/91} , Mr Novikov \n{E9/259}  and Triantal Investments {E7/182} .  \n(i) The Bank’s position on authenticity of the Deeds  \n421. The Bank has formally put Mr Bogolyubov to proof as to the authenticity of the Deeds \nof Indemnity and Waiver. However, its position on authenticity has not been made \nclear and it is unclear if they seriously suggest that they are not authentic.  \n422. In particular, the Bank did not suggest in its document presentation or Closing that \nthe Deeds were not authentic, instead claiming that they were “ self-serving ” and did not \n“accord with the reality, which shows that the second defendant continued to have a role in the Bank” \n{Day5/137:22} - 138:3.  \n423. The questions the Bank said it would have put to Mr Bogolyubov concerned why the \nDeeds were entered into, rather than whether they were authentic. e.g. , the Bank simply \nsaid that it  would have “ explored…why these documents were being generated in May 2015. \nBecause, taking a step back from them and looking at them for what they actually are, they appear to be documents in which the other participants in the misappropriation -- Kolomoisky, Novikov,  Dubilet \n-- are giving some form of purported, but obviously ineffective, assurance in the  form of an indemnity \nagainst Mr Bogolyubov's personal liability for what may have happened. Now, why would Mr Bogolyubov and these other individuals have been concerned about that in May 2015? Well, we say it is because that was the time at which they wou ld have begun to fear that what they'd done, and just \nfinished doing, wasn't capable of being covered up and might, in the end, be detected.  And here is \nwhat you see as a result. ” {Day5/138: 10} -139:1 . This suggests  that the Bank in fact \naccepts the authe nticity of the documents . No explanation  was given of why it was \nsaid that the indemnity was “ ineffective ”.  \nAA4/6/130\n127 \n 424. Similarly, the questions the Bank said they would have put to D1 in XX, revolved \naround why D1 would have indemnified Mr Bogolyubov  and proceeded on the \npremise that the Deeds were authentic . The questions included:  \n424.1  Why the Deeds were signed: “ I would certainly have asked him why he wanted to \nindemnify the second defendant against fraud, which was pretty unusual. ”  \n{Day15/140:1 6-18}  and “ why the second defendant needed an indemnity for a \"fraudulent \nor otherwise unlawful acts\" from July 2014.  What had they been up to that would have \nrequired such an indemnity? ” {Day16/3:19- 23} \n424.2  When D 1 in fact signed the agreement  (on the basis that there is no metadata \nshowing when it was signed ) {Day16/1:21} -2:3 .  \n424.3  Why D1 and Mr Bogolyubov kept the agreement secret : the Bank would have \n“explored with him the two letters in the trial bundle which purport to give the second \ndefendant directions pursuant to the indemnity agreement ” {Day16/2:20} -3:18 .  \n424.4  Confirm ing that no proceedings had been institu"}

The Bank did not suggest that it would have put it to either D1 or Mr Bogolyubov \nthat the Deeds were not in fact signed in 2015 or at all . To the contrary, the Bank said \nthat, if D1 had given evidence that he signed the Deeds in May 15 or Jul 15, the Bank would have put to D1 that EY and PwC were misled in being told there was no \nshareholder agreement {Day16/2:6- 19}. \n(ii) E vidence of authenticity of the Deeds of Indemnity and Waiver  \n426. There is clear evidence that the Deeds were signed in 2015  and are authentic .  \n427. First, drafts of the D eeds were  in circulation in May 2015.  \n427.1  On 12.5.15, Mr Bogolyubov forwarded an execution version of the D1 Deed \nof Indemnity to Mr Anischenko {E9/191.1} {E9/191.4L} . The metadata (the \nOpus view is extracted below) shows that the email was sent on 12.5.15 at 2.58pm. The signed version of th e Deed is dated 12.5.15 {E9/172L/4 -5}.  \n \n427.2  Pursuant to the D1 Deed of Indemnity, D1 agreed to procure waivers within \none month from the Bank and all of its shareholders {E9/172L/6} ¶3.1. \nAA4/6/131\n128 \n Consistently with this, o n 26.5.15, execution versions of Deeds of Waiver \nbetween Mr Bogolyubov  and Triantal  {E9/247.2} , Mr Bogolyubov and Mr \nNovikov {E9/247.3} , Mr Bogolyubov  and Mr Dubilet {E9/247.4} and Mr \nBogolyubov and D1  {E9/247.5}  as well as a deed of waiver from  the Bank  \n(which does not appear ultimately to have been signed) { E9/247.6}   were \ncirculated by email. The email has been withheld for privilege92 {E9/247.1} ; \nhowever, the metadata dates the attachments to 26.5.15 , shown in Opus:  \n \n427.3  The D1 Deed of Waiver has a handwritten date of “ 12 June ” 2015 {E10/28} \n{E10/28L} ; the Dubilet  Deed of Waiver has a handwritten date of “ 22.06 ” \n2015 and Mr Dubilet’s signature  has a handwritten date of “ 17.06.2015” \n{E10/91} pp.1,4; the Novikov Deed of Waiver has a handwritten date of \n“29/05” 2015 {E9/259} . The Triantal Deed is  dated “ 2015” with the specific \ndate apparently omitted  {E7/182} ; however, it can be inferred from the above \nthat it was signed at around the same time as the other deeds.  \n428. Second, D1 and Mr Bogolyubov ’s later behaviour is consistent with the Deeds being \nauthentic. In particular:  \n428.1  Mr Bogolyubov ’s involvement with the Bank after this point was very limited : \nsee below, Section  D2(6) ; \n \n92  The Bank raised some questions about the privileged nature of the 26.5.15 email {L/167.1} which were \nanswered by Mr Bogolyubov  {L/167.2}  and the matter has not been pursued further. See further Enyo’s \nexplanations of the privileged nature of the email in its letters of 4.6.23 {L/159.01}  (with attached \nmetadata {L/159.1}) and 9.6.23 {L/163.1} \nAA4/6/132\n129 \n 428.2  Mr Bogolyubov ’s involvement with the NBU was very limited. I t was D1 who \nled the discussions with and provided personal guarantees to the NBU : see \nabove, Section  D2(3)  and {E8/146} {E12/231} {E12/256} {E13/90/2} \n{E14/322} ;  \n428.3  D1 directed  Mr Bogolyubov  in Mar 16 to sign  a letter to adjust their interests \nin Fransiano Investments Ltd “ With reference to the Waiver Agreement dated 12 June \n2015” {E13/99} , to sign the  Sep 16 ‘Transformation Letter’ “in accordance with \nthe...

{"start": 353500, "text": " {E12/256} {E13/90/2} \n{E14/322} ;  \n428.3  D1 directed  Mr Bogolyubov  in Mar 16 to sign  a letter to adjust their interests \nin Fransiano Investments Ltd “ With reference to the Waiver Agreement dated 12 June \n2015” {E13/99} , to sign the  Sep 16 ‘Transformation Letter’ “in accordance with \nthe... Release Agreement”  {E15/272}  and to sign a letter to the NBU  (“this letter is \na written instruction pursuant to the aforementioned Waiver Agreement ”) {E18/211}. The  \nBank queries why the metadata of these documents  dates them to Dec 19 and \nthey were addressed to Mr Bogolyubov’s London address (Bank \nClosing/201(3) {AA2/15/121}); however, as has been explained to the Bank \nin correspondence, these documents were received by Enyo in hard copy and so the metadata is by nature unrelated to the date of the documents’ creation {L/64.2/ 3} ¶16. \n428.4  Consistently with the D1 Deed of Indemnity  {E9/172L/ 5} (Recital, ¶2), Mr \nBogolyubov began to reduce  his shareholding in the Bank {AA6/1/12} . \n429. Third , the fact the agreement s were not made public is consistent with the concern \nstated on the face of the Deed  of Indemnity that it would damage public confidence \nin the Bank and Ukrainian financial system if it was known that Mr Bogolyubov  no \nlonger wished to be associated with the Bank : “In order to maintain public confidence in \nPrivatBank and to maintain the stability of the Ukrainian financial system, Party 2 will stagger the reduction in his direct and indirect shareholding in PrivatBank over time .” {E9/172L/5} .  \n(iii) E\nvidence of the oral agreement of Jul  14 \n430. The D1 Deed of Indemnity states that it “ sets out the agreement which was reached on 1 July \n2014 between Party 1 [D1] and Party 2 [D2] ” {E9/172L/5} . All of the Deeds of Waiver \nalso state that they have  effect from 1.7.14.  \n431. The Bank  says that it would have challenged whether there was in fact an oral \nagreement in Jul 14  that Mr Bogolyubov  would sell his shares to D1. However, t he \nbases  on which they said they would have challenged this were flawed :93  \n \n93  Bank Closing/192 {AA2/15/118} \nAA4/6/133\n130 \n 431.1  First, the Bank submitted that there was “ no disclosed contemporaneous document ” \nsupporting the case that D1 and Mr Bogolyubov  made an oral agreement in \naround Jul 14 that Mr Bogolyubov  would sell his shares to D1 save for the \nDeed of Indemnity which the Bank stated  “doesn’t refer to any agreement to sell \nshares ” {Day5/134:1 1} -137:1 7. This is incorrect. Having stated that it records \nan agreement reached on 1.7.14, the Deed goes on to say “ In order to maintain \npublic confidence in PrivatBank and to maintain the stability of the Ukrainian financial \nsystem, Party 2 will stagger the reduction in his direct and indirect shareholding i n \nPrivatBank over time until he is no longer a shareholder in PrivatBank as well as remaining in the position of Chairman pending the identification of an appropriate replacement .” \n{E9/172L/5}  (Recital, ¶2).  \n431.2  S\necondly , the Bank claimed that D1’s abandoned witness statement “ denied any \nsuch agreement ” referring to Kolomoisky5/35  {B2/1/7}  {Day5/135:1 2-14} \n{Day16/1:14 -20}. This is wrong . Kolomoisky5/35- 36 reads as follows:  \n35. In 2014, due to the fact that  I served as a Governor and therefore had the \nstatus of a politically exposed person (which limited my ability to actively \nparticipate in the management of my businesses), Mr. Bogolyubov and I started discussions on how to split our joint assets, but we did not reach any agreement in this regard.  \n36. In 2015, the law changed to mean that shareholders were responsible for the \nacts of the company and Mr Bogolyubov said he did not want to be in involved in the Bank anymore.

Mr Dubilet explained to both of us that if Mr Bogolyubov was no longer a share holder, this would cause all sorts of issues underthe Bank's \nregulations. Mr Bogolyubov accordingly agreed not to leave due to these complications but he asked that I provide him with an indemnity in return. We entered into a deed on 12 May 2015 (the \"Deed  of Indemnity\") \n(GB_NC_0003039) which set out our agreement. In the Deed of Indemnity I agreed to indemnify Mr Bogolyubov against any liabilities arising in connection with the Bank dating from 1 July 2014 onwards.                                  {B2/1/7}  \n431.3  Thirdly , that there is no record that Mr Bogolyubov voted his shares and acted \nas Chairman at Mr Kolomoisky’s direction. This does not counteract the \nexistence of clear evidence of the agreement in the Deeds themselves.  \n431.4  F ourthly , the Bank makes a pleading point that no particulars of the oral \nagreement were pleaded. This holds no weight in circumstances where the oral agreement is recorded in the Deeds.  \nAA4/6/134\n131 \n (iv) The significance  of the Deeds \n432. The Deeds record  Mr Bogolyubov ’s lack of involvement in the Bank from 1.7.14: \n432.1  D1 Deed of Indemnity, Recitals: “Despite remaining a shareholder of PrivatBank and \nin the position of Chairman for the time being, Party 2 [D2] no longer exercises any \nmanagement control over PrivatBank de facto even though he continues to do so de jure. Since \n1 July 2014 Party 2 has been voting his shares in PrivatBank and acting as Chairman at the sole direction of Party 1 [D1] ” {E9/172L/5} .  \n432.2  D1 Deed of Indemnity, Clause 2  {E9/172L/6} :  \n2.1. Party 2  [D2] hereby declares and Party 1 [D1] acknowledges that since 1 July \n2014 Party 2 has been voting his shares in PrivatBank and acting as Chairman at the \nsole direction of Party 1 and will continue to do so until the Resignation Date,  \n2.2. Party 2 [D2] hereby declares and Party 1 [D1] acknowledges that Party 2 no \nlonger exercises any management control over PrivatBank d& facto, \nnotwithstanding that he continues to be the Chairman and remains a shareholder of \nPrivafBank de jure. Any acts decisions or directions which are effected by Part y 2 \nin the Relevant Period are solely as a result of instructions given by Party 1.  \n432.3  D1 Deed of Waiver, Recital (D): “ Whereas Mr Kolomoisky acknowledges that during \nthe Relevant Period, Mr Bogolyubov has acted in connection with the Shareholding and the \nChairmanship only on the basis of Mr Kolomoisky’s instructions and will continue to do so until the end of the Relevant Period .” {E10/28}  \n432.4  The other Deeds of Waiver all contain the following Recital (D): “[ Mr Dubilet ] \n[Mr Novikov] [ Triantal] recognises that in the Relevant period, Mr Bogolyubov has been \nconducting his Shareholding and his Chairmanship at the sole instruction of Mr Kolomoiskyi and will continue to do so until the end of the Relevant Period .” {E10/91} {E9/259} \n{E7/182} . \n433. The Deed of Indemnity also recognised that Mr Bogolyubov  intended to exit the Bank, \nrecording that he would “ stagger the reduction in his direct and indirect shareholding in \nPrivatBank over time until he is no longer a shareholder in PrivatBank” and would identify an “appropriate replacement ” as Chairman of the Supervisory Board.  \n434. Pursuant to the Deeds of Waiver, Mr Kolomoisky , Mr Dubilet, Mr Novikov and \nTriantal all agreed to “ waive and release Mr Bogolyubov from all and any liability arising out of \nthe Shareholding or the Chairmanship from 1 July 2014 until the date Mr. Bogolyubov ceases to be \na direct or indirect shareholder of PrivatBank ”. \nAA4/6/135\n132 \n 435.

The Deeds thus record and evidence Mr Bogolyubov’s lack of de facto control over the \nBank from 1.7.14. His conduct was consistent with this, limited to the minimum, largely comprising acting on the Supervisory Board and signing formal letters to the NBU. Significantly, 69 of the 270 RDDs  and 61 of the 82 URPPs  took place on or \nafter 1.7.14 i.e. after the time at which Mr Bogolyubov  had de facto stepped back from \nthe Bank.  \n436. As to why Mr Bogolyubov wished to sign the Deeds, the Bank’s suggestion that this is because he “ knew he had committed fraudulent acts ” (Bank Closing/199 {AA2/15/119} ) \nis pure speculation and does not hold water. The Deeds were signed by those who, on the Bank’s case, were most closely involved in the ‘Scheme ’: Mr Kolomoisky, Mr \nDubilet and Mr Novikov. The Bank has not proffered any suggested explanation for why these individuals would sign Deeds recognising Mr Bogolyubov ’s lack of \ninvolvement in the Bank, and agreeing to waive his liability and indemnif y him, if in \ntruth, he was also involved in the ‘Scheme ’.  \n437. Why would they record these facts unless they were true?  \n(6) Contemporaneous evidence of control  \n438. To support its case on Mr Bogolyubov ’s alleged  control of the Bank, the Bank \nproduced on Day 5 a hand- out “ Chronology of D2’s documented involvement with the bank \nfrom 30 December 2013 – 9 September 2014” {AA6/3 }. The reason for choosing this \nparticular time period was not explained: {Day5/133:9- 12}. It does not map onto the \nRelevant Drawdown period (1.11.13- 1.9.14) and it stops shortly after the effective date \nof the Deeds of Waiver and Indemnity (1.7.14).  This hand- out demonstrates the \nweakness of the Bank’s case. There are a total of 47 entries. Of these:  \n438.1  Thirty  entries record Mr Bogolyubov ’s attendance at Supervisory Board \nmeetings at which various resolutions were passed ( e.g. approval of financial \nstatements, financial recovery plans  and appointments to the Management \nBoard ). None of the resolutions concerned lending by the Bank.  \n438.2  Four  entries record him signing loan agreements between the Bank and NBU \nin his capacity as Chair of the Supervisory Board. One other entry shows him \n(as Chair of the Supervisory Board) and Mr Dubilet (as Chair of the Management Board) writing to the NBU to request a stabilisation loan. (The \nBank later added further examples of similar letters to the NBU e.g. {E1/194.1} \n{E3/172.02}  {E6/225.1} ). \nAA4/6/136\n133 \n 438.3  Three  entries are Mr Bogolyubov ’s call records with Mr Dubilet, Mr \nKolomoisky  and Mr Novikov.  \n438.4  One entry records Mr Bogolyubov  signing a shareholder representation letter \nto PwC regarding the Bank’s compliance with related party regulations.  \n438.5  Three  entries (two of which are bare forwards) record Mr Bogolyubov  sending \ninformation to Mr Dubilet regarding problems with Moskom Privatbank (one \nof the Bank’s subsidiaries) and Sberbank’s interest in acquiring it.  \n438.6  One entry shows Mr Luchaninov asking Mr Dubilet to procure backdated \nSupervisory Board minutes signed by  Mr Bogolyubov  approving a loan to Ms \nShmalchenko. Mr Bogolyubov  was not on this email chain and, as discussed \nabove  (¶397.3), there is no evidence that he was in fact asked to (or did) sign \nthe minutes . \n438.7  Two  entries concern loans from the Bank in respect of projects in which Mr \nBogolyubov ’ was interested . \n438.8  One entry is an email concerning  a loan issued by PrivatBank Latvia.  \n438.9  One entry records an email from Mr Dubilet to Mr Bogolyub"}

The Bank also relied upon an EY report, which states  that the Bank’s management \nhad said that “ none of the shareholders of the Bank is to be considered as its controller ” \n{E17/242/8}  and to internal emails between Bank employees about whether they \ncould be considered controllers, in which Mr Romanov had noted that D1 and Mr \nBogolyubov  “are listed as the ultimate beneficiaries (controllers) of the Bank on the EDRPOU \nwebsite ” {E10/141}. The Bank said  that if the Deeds were authentic , there was a \nshareholder agreement pursuant to which D1 and Mr Bogolyubov  should have been \nclassified as controllers of the Bank, yet  there is no evidence that such an agreement \nwas disclosed to the Bank’s auditors  {Day15/130:13} -140:1 . These points go nowhere \nin terms of the question of de facto control:  \n439.1  The question of whether D1 and Mr Bogolyubov  were ultimate beneficiaries \nof the Bank (which is accepted) is different from whether they exercised day -\nto-day control over the Bank.  \nAA4/6/137\n134 \n 439.2  There were reasons for keeping the Deeds secret, as explained above, such that \nthe fact Bank employees and auditors appear not to have known of the Deeds does not bear on their authenticity.  \n439.3  The Bank failed to  refer to p.3 of {E10/141}\n94 where Mr Luchaninov (i.e. the \nBank’s own witness) drew a distinction between ownership and control: “ I agree \nwith this statement – Mssrs IVK and BGB are not the bank’s controllers, but hold a \nsubstantial stake ”. The Bank could have covered this with Mr Luchaninov in his \nevidence, but chose not to.  \n440. Finally, the Bank claimed that there is evidence showing Mr Bogolyubov  was actively \ninvolved in Bank affairs after 1.7.14. T he evidence adduced  did not support this: \n440.1  The Bank relied upon an email from Mr Bogolyubov  to Mr Dubilet asking \n“Can we make a payment EUR 3 million to the Cuban company without consequences for \nthe Bank” {E8/75} {Day5/130: 8} -132:13. This related to PrivatBank Latvia \n(“any chance PB Latvia could do it…? ”) and has no bearing on Mr Bogolyubov ’s \ninvolvement in the Bank’s affairs.  \n440.2  The Bank relied also on  an email from Mr Bogolyubov  to Mr Dubilet saying \n“they are proposing this structure ” and attaching a chart showing the structure of a \nmortgage {E15/131.1} {E15/131.2}. The Bank says that “ The attachment makes \nit clear that this is all to do with the loan to be granted by the Bank ” {Day5/132:14- 25}. \nIn fact , it is clear from the attached chart {E15/131.2}  and surrounding \ndocuments {E15/131.01} {E15/131.02} {E15/131.03 } that this is concerned \nwith the structure of a  loan by BTA Bank .  Privat Bank is not even mentioned \nand it is clearly not concerned with the Bank’s affairs (as opposed to one of Mr \nBogolyubov’s business projects).   \n440.3  The other examples relied upon by the Bank are in its chronology of Mr \nBogolyubov’s involvement in the Bank. All of the post -1.7.14 examples a re of \nacts taken by him as Chair of the Supervisory Board {AA6/3/5 -7}. \n441. In summary, none of this shows any exercise by Mr Bogolyubov of day -to-day control \nof the Bank. Most of  his involvement comprised formal acts taken on the Supervisory \nBoard and as a shareholder.  \n \n94  Bank Closing/145 {AA2/15/91- 92} extracts only from pages 1 -2.  \nAA4/6/138\n135 \n 442.

The Bank has belatedly produced a new version of its D2 chronology: Bank \nClosing/Appendix D1 {AA2/18} . The Bank was meant to provide Mr Bogolyubov  \nwith a full list of references to evidence relied upon against him at the end of the close of its document presentation and purported to do so in {AA6/17}. Mr Bogolyubov \nobjects to the introduction of this new list, which contains references to many documents that were not even adduced in evidence at trial.\n95 To the extent necessary, \nMr Bogolyubov will address this orally . The following observations can be made  about \nnew Appendix D1: \n442.1  Over  the Relevant Period, the vast majority of entries  are colour -coded g reen \n(Supervisory Board meetings) or yellow (Interactions with the NBU), \nconsistent with Mr Bogolyubov’s case that his involvement in the Bank was largely in a formal capacity. These include the Bank’s examples  of Mr \nBogolyubov signing (as required by his role on the Supervisory Board) letters \nand documents concerning the grant of NBU stabilisation loans  and approving  \ncertain actions taken by the Bank in relation to the Restructuring ( in relation to \nwhich the Bank accepts that “ D1 took the lead ”): Bank Closing /184-186 \n{AA2/15/11 1}. The fact that he remained involved in these capacities does not \ncut across his position that he had distanced himself from the Bank after 1.7.14 and performed his roles at D1’s direction. \n442.2  The colour code orange is used to cover  interactions with Bank staff about \nBank business  and Mr Bogolyubov’s other assets and  personal matters. This is \npresumably designed to disguise the fact that hardly any of these documents have anything to do with Bank business at all . The Bank also fails accurately to \ndescribe the documents e.g. failing to d istinguish between entries concerning \nthe Bank’s Ukraine business and the activities of other branches, such as PrivatBank Latvia ( e.g. {E8/75} ), claiming  documents relate to lending by the \nBank when they do not ( e.g. the BTA Bank example above ) and giving \ndocuments ambiguous titles disguising their irrelevant nature ( e.g. describing \n{E1/236.01} as “Dubilet emails D2 providing him access to a number of media files ” \n{AA2/18/1}, where the document shows Mr Dubilet sending Mr Bogolyubov photos and videos from his birthday party.  \n \n95  Some have not even been uploaded to the trial bundle as shown by their disclosure references.  \nAA4/6/139\n136 \n 443. Unfortunately, the chronology is not a reliable record and should not be used by the \nCourt without reference to the underlying documents . Moreover, n one of the entries \nin the chronology or examples given at Bank Closing/180 {AA2/15/107} show Mr \nBogolyubov exercising any control in any relevant way over the Bank . More \nimportantly, none have anything to do with the ‘Scheme’  or any actions said to (or \neven similar to those said to) comprise it .  \n(7) Alleged control of the Management Board and Credit Committee  \n444. The Bank claims that D1 and Mr Bogolyubov  implemented the ‘Scheme ’ through \nmembers of the Management Board and Credit Committee, saying that  there were “ no \ninnocent members of the management board. They were all D1/D2 acolytes ready and wi lling to do \ntheir bidding ” {Day15/30:7- 9}. This is a vital part of the Bank’s case, as it was the \nManagement Board and Credit Committee which approved the Relevant Loa ns.

In relation to many members of the Management Board and Credit Committee, the Bank has offered no evidence of control or loyalty at all, simply  making the general \nassertion that the Supervisory Board appointed the Management Board and that decisions were approved unanimously without dissent. The Bank promised a hand-out \nwith evidence relating to other members of the Management Board {Day15/54:13-\n21} however this has not  been provided. The other individuals involved in approving \nthe Relevant Loans on the Management Board  are Mr Kandaurov, Ms Shmalchenko \nand Mr Kryzhanovskyy, and on the ECC are Mr Linsky, Mr Ponomarov and Ms \nYevstafieva: Bank Closing/159- 160 {AA2/15/ 97-98}. \n \n96 Reply/3A.1 {A1/25/3}, Reply/7A.1 {A1/25/10} , RRRRAPOC/12(e) {A1/2/5} \nAA4/6/140\n137 \n 447. Further, in relation to the individuals it has  purported to cover, the majority of \nevidence relied upon by the Bank relate s solely to D1.  \n(i) Mr D ubilet   \n448. The Bank relies upon calls between Mr Bogolyubov  and Mr Dubilet in 2014 and a \nhandful of emails exchanged between them. Some of this evidence has been addressed \nalready at D2 Opening/146 {AA4/1/58}. The following points can be made:  \n448.1  There are only c.30 email chains and one letter between Mr Bogolyubov  and \nMr Dubilet in the trial bundle. Nearly all of these pre -date 1.7.14.97  \n448.2  Most of the documents to which both Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Dubilet are \nparty are formal, such as letters to the NBU written in their respective capacities as Chair of the Supervisory Board and Chair of the Management Board ( e.g. \nseeking stabilisation loans ) and Supervisory Board minutes. \n448.3  No instant messages between Mr Bogolyubov  and Mr Dubilet have been \nidentified and there is evidence of only a handful of texts  (only one of which is \npost- 1.7.14 and for which the substance of the messages is not available ) {K5 -\nE/4/22} {K5- E/6/9} {K5 -E/6/15} {K5 -E/8/8} .  \n448.4  Mr Bogolyubov  has disclosed phone records showing 108 calls with Mr Dubilet \nbetween 3.2.14 and 28.5.14 { Day5/57:4} . This contradicts the Bank’s theory \nthat Mr Bogolyubov  communicated with his “ lieutenants ” secretly on “ the Black ”. \nHe clearly was not afraid of having call records.  \n449. As to the substance of the communications  between Mr Bogolyubov  and Mr Dubilet, \nnone of this is related to the ‘Scheme’  or the acts said to comprise it. Mr Bogolyubov  \nand Mr Dubilet d id not correspond about any of the relevant lending despite Mr \nDubilet signing off on nearly all of the Relevant Loans. The content of the \ncorrespondence (a full list of which is footnoted) is innoc uous:\n98  \n449.1  Some of the emails relate to Mr Bogolyubov ’s business interests, e.g.  emails \nwhich show Mr Dubilet asking Mr Bogolyubov  to “give instructions on the limits \nfor 2013” in relation to managers of some of his businesses {E1/259 } {E1/260} \n \n97  This does not cover the formal documents covered in the next sub-paragraph.  \n98  A list of the"}

However ( i) there is no evidence that the limits he \nrequested were approved; and ( ii) this  shows nothing about day -to-day control \nof the Management Board’s decisions, as opposed to (at most) instructions \nbeing given in relation to his own assets . Further, there is a conceptual \ndistinction to be drawn between a request from Mr Dubilet to Mr Bogolyubov  \nfor instructions in relation to his assets, and the Bank’s suggestion that the \nManagement Board simply operated as stooges to defraud the Bank a t Mr \nBogolyubov ’s request. As the Judge queried at  {Day3 /52:11 -23}: \nMR JUSTICE TROWER:  Is there a conceptual distinction between people \njumping when they thought Mr Kolomoisky or Mr Bogolyubov was behind \nsomething and actually the necessity to convey information to them in a \nproactive manner in order to obtain instruction s for the purposes of doing \nsomething?  Because they are -- one needs to concentrate in a case like this on \nthe difference between a proactive and a reactive relationship.  Is it your case \nthat there's enough in the material to show that consent and instru ctions were \nrequired or does it go no further than, once Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov \ngot interested in something, people responded in a way that was consistent with their wishes?  \n449.2  Some emails relate  to the Bank , e.g. Mr Dubilet sends Mr Bogolyubov  an \nanalysis by VTB concerning the Bank’s bond offering {E1/253}  and Mr \nDubilet updates Mr Bogolyubov  on decisions about actions to be taken in \nrelation to Cyprus deposits {E1/275} .  \n449.3  Some emails (all pre -dating 1.7.14) appear to concern business opportunities \nfor the  Bank e.g. enquiries about the sale of Moskom Privatbank’s assets \n{E3/101.1} {E3/124.1} {E3/124.2}, information on Banco Portugues SA \n{E1/239.01 } {E1/239.02}  and on Dnipro Credit Bank {E1/342.02 } \n{E1/342.03} {E1/342.04} .  \n449.4  Mr Dubilet sometimes assist ed Mr Bogolyubov  as a client, e.g.  sending him \nBank statements {E2/33.01} , information regarding Bank cards {E2/148.1}  \nand Viber notifications {E2/200.1} . (It is true that this assistance may have \nbeen ‘below Mr Dubilet’s pay grade’ ; however, the fact that Mr Bogolyubov  \nwas treated as a VIP says nothing about whether he controlled the Bank.)  \n \n99  Other examples of emails in this category are {E2/130.7} {E2/130.8} {E2/130.9}  \nAA4/6/142\n139 \n 449.5  Mr Bogolyubov  occasionally sent business queries to Mr Dubilet , such as \nwhether it was possible for PrivatBank Latvia to make a payment to a Cuban \ncompany {E8/75} , asking what should be done about the proposed transfer \nof financing of Hotel Split from Sberbank to the Bank  {E15/132.1}  and \nsending him a proposed debt structure for a loan from BTA Bank (not \nPrivatBank) {E15/131.1} {E15/131.2}.  These were not “ instructions ” to Mr \nDubilet as the Bank suggests (Bank Closing/88(2)(c) ) {AA2/15/66}  and have \nnothing to do with management of the Bank.  \n449.6  The two also had some communications  relating to personal and mundane \nmatters like a sleep and  fitness tracker  {E2/86.1} {E2/86.2}  and birthday \nphotos {E1/236.01} . \n450.

There are only three examples in the trial bundle of Mr Dubilet being in touch with \nMr Bogolyubov  post -Nationalisation:  \n450.1  In Feb 17, Mr  Dubilet sent Mr Bogolyubov  a copy of the Bank’s insider list \n{E17/142.1}  {E17/142.2} . The reason is not clear; however it may  relate to an \nNBU investigation : (i) on 14.12.16, the NBU sent Mr Dubilet  a letter with its \ndeterminations  from a previous related party audit {E17/36} ; and ( ii) on \n30.1.17,  the NBU produced a report on its audit of the Bank for the period \n2.4.16- 17.10.16 , concluding inter alia  that the New Borrowers are related parties \nand that the prohibition on transactions with relat ed parties had not been \nobserved {E17/ 138/58 }. It does not suggest that  Mr Bogolyubov  continued \nto be involved in the Bank, as the Bank submits {Day3/17:1 -4}. \n450.2  On 21.6.17, Mr Dubilet  messaged D1 in response to a query “ where is the April \ndraft of the Ernst report ” saying “Talked to GB. I’m looking for a draft ” {K5-\nA1/17/15};  \n450.3  On 12.7.19, Mr Bogolyubov  messaged D1 asking “ Did you call the Dubilets for \nTuesday. It would [be] good for me to be present .” {K5 -A2/5/32} .  \n451. The Bank also relied upon D1 sending to Mr Bogolyubov  in Sep  19 a summons from \nthe NACB addressed to Mr Dubilet  {K5-A2/6/5 -6} {K5-C1/182}. The Bank claimed \nit was notable that Mr Bogolyubov  did not “ react with horror and outrage ” {Day15/39:20-\n21}. The question of how Mr Bogolyubov  reacted is pure speculation and it is natural \nthat D1 and Mr Bogolyubov  should be interested in such inf ormation .  \nAA4/6/143\n140 \n 452. There is nothing in any of the above that contains any suggestion that Mr Bogolyubov \nhad anything to do with the ‘Scheme’ , knew of or condoned any of the relevant acts \ntaken by Mr Dubilet. The fact that the two were in contact on legitimate matters is not sufficient for any such inference to be drawn.  Further, there is no proper basis for \ninferring from any post -Nationalisation conduct, that he must have known of or been \ninvolved in pre-Nationalisation misappropriation.  \n(ii) Ms Gurieva  \n453. As the Bank accepts, there is no evidence of communications between Mr Bogolyubov \nand Ms Gurieva . The Bank relies instead on her detailed communications with D1 , the \nfact she was listed in the ‘Black’ directory , her participation in the production of the \nLafferty Spreadsheets (in which Mr Bogolyubov had no role)  and the simple fact that \nMs Gurieva worked in BOK : Bank Closing/95 {AA2/15/69- 70}.100 None of these \nmatters  evidence s any control by Mr Bogolyubov  over Ms Gurieva , or instructions \ngiven by Mr Bogolyubov  to Ms Gurieva, as the Bank suggests , let alone control of the \nexercise of her functions on the Management Board. \n(iii) Mr Novikov \n454. The Bank relies upon Mr Bogolyubov ’s relationship with Mr Novikov in relation to \nhis alleged control of both the Bank and Primecap. T he documents  show that Mr \nBogolyubov ’s relationship with Mr Novikov related  for the most part  to his personal \nbusiness matters, in particular the structuring and management of his asset holdings.  \n455. There is no evidence to suggest, as the Bank would have it, that Mr Bogolyubov “ used \nMr Novikov to undertake the day -to-day administration….at BOK and PBC and Primecap” or \nthat, through him, Mr Bogolyubov  “controlled both  the Bank's investment business department, \nwhich he headed, and Primecap which he headed”.

None of their communications concern \nthe ‘Scheme’ . \n456. The communications between Mr Bogolyubov  and Mr Novikov in the bundle \ncomprise call records, instant messages and emails.  \n \n100  The Bank selectively relies upon parts of Mr Bogolyubov’s trial witness statements (here upon the \npassage where he accepts that some of his companies were clients of BOK): Bank Closing/95(3)(a) \n{AA2/15/70} without mentioning the parts that are actually relevant, here Bogolyubov5/10: “ Although \nI knew Ms Gurieva, I had very few interactions with her. I do not believe that I ever gave Ms Gurieva direct instructions in relation to the operation of the Bank and I have no recollection of having done so. I certainly never gave instructions to  \nMs Gurieva (or anyone else) in respect of the scheme that is alleged by the Bank in these proceedings […]” {B2/12/3} \nAA4/6/144\n141 \n 456.1  During the relevant period, t here are records of 121 calls (for a total of 228  \nminutes) between them ( occurring in the period for which records are available: \n8.2.14 to 30.5.14)  {Day5/57:1 -2}. Again, this contradicts the Bank’s suggestion \nthat their relationship was so illicit and secretive that they were only willing to \ncommunicate on the “Black” without leaving a trace.  \n456.2  They exchanged  849 WhatsApp messages between 26.4.18 and 20.5.21 { K5-\nA2/15} (some redacted)  with 119 attachments  {K5-C5}. Mr Bogolyubov  has \nbeen unable to collect messages before this time .101 These messages just show \nMr Bogolyubov  and Mr Novikov communicating on personal business \nmatters, e.g. Mr Novikov sending account balances , payment transfer \ninformation and budgets to Mr Bogolyubov  and discussing business deals e.g. \n{K5-A2/15/3} {K5 -A2/15/23- 24}.102 Due to the lack of illicit discussions, the \nBank felt compelled to claim that these are just the “things he’s prepared to say in \na WhatsApp” as “there’s obviously a lot of offline discussion ” {Day5/40:13- 15}. Yet , \nthe two men exchange detailed information (further e.g.s  are {K5-A2/15/32} \n{K5-A2/15/54} ), so it is unclear what it is said they are hiding . It is also hardly \nsuspicious that they arrange to talk in person or on the phone – in any business \nrelationship, people have “ multiple ways of speaking without leaving a record ” \n{Day5/44:23- 24}. \n456.3  The emails exchanged between Mr Novikov and Mr Bogolyubov  are \nsummarised in the Bank’s hand- out at {AA6/17/17 -24}. The vast majority \nrelate to  Mr Bogolyubov ’s personal assets . None show him giving any \ninstructions as to the management of the Bank103 and none relate to the \n‘Scheme’ . Contrary to the Bank’s claim that these emails were “ found mostly from \nother disclosure sources ” {Day5/49:1 6-24}, many of the key emails relied  upon by \nthe Bank are from Mr Bogolyubov ’s disclosure e.g.  {E1/116} {E1/178} \n{E1/239.1} {E1/239.2} {E1/272.1} {E1/273} {E2/170.1}.  \n \n101  An explanation is provided at {A4/32/9}. There is no evidence to support the Bank’s assertions  that \nMr Bogolyubov has purposefully deleted these messages.  \n102  This is shown by the Bank’s table of examples at Bank Closing/82(2) {AA2/15/59} \n103  There is one email from Mr Novikov to Mr Bogolyubov dated 22.3.13 that appears to be an update on \nmeasures to be taken at the Cyprus branch { E1/281.1}. \nAA4/6/145\n142 \n 457.

In summary, none of these communications have any bearing on Mr Bogolyubov ’s \nalleged control of the Bank  or involvement in the ‘Scheme’ . The mere fact that Mr \nNovikov took instructions from Mr Bogolyubov  in relation to the management of his \npersonal assets has no bearing on whether Mr Novikov took instructions f rom him in \nrelation to the day- to-day management of the Bank.  \n458. Nor do Mr Novikov’s communications with Mr Anischenko. Again, these relate to Mr \nBogolyubov ’s personal business interests and administrative matters and not the \nmanagement of the Bank e.g.  their WhatsApp messages from 4.10.15- 10.6.16 {K5-\nA3/11} and mid- 2017 onwards  {K5-A3/12}  {K5-A3/13} .104 Mr Anischenko assisted \nMr Bogolyubov in managing his assets, part of which role included liaising with Mr Novikov. The Bank initially claimed  that one of these messages {K5 -A3/13/6}  \n(22.11.17)  was a “ leak of information from the Bank ”, before having to swiftly backtrack \nwhen realising that the information was about PrivatBank Latvia, in which D1 and Mr \nBogolyubov at that time remained shareholders {Day5/46:14} - 48:12 {J3/1/14} .  \n459. The Bank’s case relies heavily on illegitimate conflation of D1 and D2. In particular, it persists in asserting that Mann J’s finding  in JKX that Mr Novikov was D1’s “ right hand \nman” {I3/54/12}  ¶30 extended to D2: e.g.  “D1-2’s right hand man ” Bank Closing/¶9(3) \n{AA2/15/11 }.  The Bank also relies selectively upon Mr Novikov’s witness statement \nin the Pinchuk proceedings (which has no evidential weight in these proceedings) \nskipping over ¶10 {I3/12/3} : “I should note that, throughout the period relevant to these \nproceedings, I mainly liaised with, and received instructions from, Mr Kolomoisky as he was more involved in the various corporate matters than Mr Bogolyubov.”: {Day3/18:14} -20:8, \n{Day5/37:4- 11}, Bank Closing/82 {AA2/15/58} . \n(iv) Mr Pi\nkush  \n460. The evidence relied upon by the Bank comprises Mr Pikush’s involvement in the \nLuchaninov Email exercise and precursor meeting (dealt with above) ; his involvement \nin investigating  the NashiGroshi article; and in related party and foreign currency \nissues and the Transformation: Bank Closing/165 {AA2/15/100} . There is no \nevidence showing communications between Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Pikush, let alone \nevidence that Mr Bogolyubov controlled any of Mr Pikush’s actions. \n \n104  The fact that the Bank sunk to the level of relying upon a message about the purchase of herring shows \njust how irrelevant these messages are: Bank Closing/82(6)(c) {AA2/15/61}.  \nAA4/6/146\n143 \n (v) Mr Gorokhovsky \n461. The Bank relied on no contemporaneous evidence in relation to Mr Gorokhovsky , \nrelying (in relation to Mr Bogolyubov) on their presence in Geneva in F eb 18  (as to \nwhich see ¶476 below ) and a message from Mr Gorokhovsky to D1 in Jun 19 : Bank \nClosing/167 {AA2/15/101}.  There is no evidence that Mr Bogolyubov controlled any \nof Mr Gorokhovsky’s actions. \n(vi) Ms Chmona \n462. The evidence relied upon by the Bank largely comprises messages between Ms \nChmona and D1 , dealing with D1 ’s assets and  seeking D1’s approval for payments \nrelating to some companies in which Mr Bogolyubov  has disclosed an interest e.g. {K5-\nA1/11/3}. This shows nothing in terms of control by Mr Bogolyubov . The Bank also \nrelies upon the ‘Black’ and two indirect communications requesting that Mr \nBogolyubov approve payments in respect of this companies: Bank Closing/168 \n{AA2/15/102} . The scarcity of the evidence was demonstrated by the fact that one of \nthe very few examples featured in the Bank’s opening {Day3/26:11 -20} was an instant \nmessage from D1 to Mr Bogolyubov  of 30.7.20  s"}

The scarcity of the evidence was demonstrated by the fact that one of \nthe very few examples featured in the Bank’s opening {Day3/26:11 -20} was an instant \nmessage from D1 to Mr Bogolyubov  of 30.7.20  stating “ need to show Chmona ”, \npotentially in relation to a photograph {K5-A2/8/ 26} and bearing no relevance to the \n‘Scheme ’ or period under consideration, let alone questions of control. \n(vii) M r Yatsenko  \n463. The only evidence relied upon by the Bank that has anything to do with Mr \nBogolyubov comprises Mr Yatsenko’s involvement in the alleged “ plan for eliminating \nconnections between D1 -2 and 42 BOK clients ” (as to which there was no attempt to “ hide” \nconnections as explained above); his presence in Geneva in Feb 18  (see ¶476 below) ; \nhis involvement in the Asset Transfer which happened to include some of Mr \nBogolyubov’s assets;  Mr Bogolyubov sending D1 a press article about Mr Yatsenko in \n2021; and correspondence with PwC about Hotel Split : Bank Closing/163 \n{AA2/15/98- 100}. The Bank is scraping the barrel. There is no evidence of actual \ncommunications between Mr Bogolyubov  and Mr Yatsenko  or anything with any \nrelevance to control of the Bank or the ‘Scheme’. \n(viii) Ms Shmalchenko, Mr Kryzhanovskiy and Ms Korotina:  \n464. None of the evidence relied upon by the Bank to suggest that these individuals took \ninstructions from Mr Bogolyubov suggests any communication (direct or indirect) \nAA4/6/147\n144 \n between them, let alone (for the most part) having anything to do with Mr Bogolyubov \nat all: Bank Closing/170- 172 {AA2/15/104}. \n(ix) Miscellaneous evidence  \n465. The Bank relied upon some further points  in relation to the supposed control by D1 \nand Mr Bogolyubov over members of the Management Board, namely:   \n465.1  That these members  received a “ quid pro quo ” of shares in the Bank. This is \ndealt with at D2 Opening/148 {AA4/1/59} . \n465.2  That they were on the ‘ Black ’. This is dealt with below : Section D3( 2).  \n465.3  That the Management Board did not investigate the allegations made in the Glavcom Article in Nov 14 {Day15/86:5} - 93:19. However, the documents \nshow t hat Mr Dubilet asked Ms Shmalchenko, Mr Linsky and Mr Serga to \ninvestigate allegations of misuse of NBU refinancing loans {E6/324} . To the \nextent there  was a  lack of desire to investigate the issue , this is equally consistent \nwith the  alternative explanation that the employees had been  “firefighting” and \nattempting to get around restrictive regulations.  At any rate, this post -dated \n1.7.14 (the date of D1 and Mr Bogolyubov ’s agreement) , undermining the \nBank’s suggestion that Mr Bogolyubov  had any role in directing the response \nto the article {Day15/97:10- 16}. \n(x) Other employees  \n466. The Bank claims that other employees at the Bank also acted on Mr Bogolyubov ’s \ninstructions e.g. “there are lots and lots and lots of WhatsApp messages which show both executives \nwithin the bank and also lower level employees, particularly to D1 but also to D2, saying, “here’s what we propose to do. Is it OK?”, and the response they typically get is “O K”, ie, “you can make \nthose payments”. ” {Day3/53:17- 22}. The majority of the evidence relied upon relates to \nD1: Bank Closing/173- 179 {AA2/15/106} . Insofar as it relates  to Mr Bogolyubov  (e.g. \nthe example of Ms Markova with whom Mr Bogolyubov  did exchange  messages  about \nhis personal assets : {K5-E/1}  (during the Relevant period) { K5-A2/14} (2020) ), they \nhave nothing to do with management of the Bank.  \n(8) Evidence  from post -Nationalisation  \n467.

As shown in relation to the individuals above, t he Bank  seeks  to use evidence from \npost- Nationalisation to draw inferences as to Mr Bogolyubov ’s pre-Nationalisation  \ncontrol of the Bank. Further instances of this are dealt with below. Much of this \nAA4/6/148\n145 \n evidence does not apply to Mr Bogolyubov  at all, and some of the Bank’s claims (e.g. \nas to the “ complete loyalty ” of employees to Mr Bogolyubov) are exaggerated.  \n(i) Change in employees post- Nationalisation  \n468. The Bank has suggested that the Management Board and Credit Committee, as well as \nlower -level Bank employees, were completely loyal to D1 and Mr Bogolyubov , relying \non M s Pakhachuk ’s evidence that  this presented a problem post -Nationalisation : \nPakhachuk/17- 18 {B1/1/6}. An analysis of  the employees and executives who \nremained in place after Nationalisation  shows that those claims are exaggerated . Many \nindividuals who were key executives pre -Nationalisation were kept on and others  \nactively appointed to positions of responsibility afterwards. E.g. : \n468.1  Mr Luchaninov continued as Head of Compliance { AA1/5/7 }.  \n468.2  Mr Tanankov , Mr Nikolenko, Mr Shaban, Mr Sokolovskyi and Ms Shevchenko  \nwere appointed to the post -Nationalisation Credit Committee  {Day12/5:17} -\n8:7 {E17/137/3} { AA1/5 } (pp.8, 11- 12).105 \n468.3  Mr Linsky stayed on as Head of Finance and Risk  and a member of the Asset \nCommittee {E17/137/3 } {AA1/5/7 }. Ms Pakhachuk accepted he was an \n“important employee ” with “ key responsibilities with regard to finance and reporting of the \nBank ” {Day12/3:12} - 4:23. \n468.4  Mr Vetluzhskikh  continued as the Head of Internal Audit { AA1/5/13 }. \n468.5  Mr Levadskiy, who was involved in a preliminary investigation of the alleged misappropriation in Feb  15 {E8/49} , was appointed to a further investigation \nin Jan  17 {E17/135}  {AA1/5/7 }.  \n468.6  Ms Lozytska, pre -Nationalisation head of one of the departments in BOK, was \nappointed to stay on as Head of NURA {AA1/5/7 }.  \n468.7  Ms Pogorelaya, pre -Nationalisation Deputy Head of the Loan Department in \nthe Corporate VIP Business stayed on as Chief Specialist in Department of \nSales to Medium Sized Businesses { AA1/5/9 }.  \n469. It also transpired that Ms Pakhachuk’s claims that the legal department “ had to be \ncompletely transformed because of our concerns that the existing staff within it was loyal to the Former \n \n105 Evidence that these were employees pre-Nationalisation can be seen at {E1/181/10 -11} and {E4/203/4}. \nAA4/6/149\n146 \n Owners ” {B1/1/6} ¶19 were exaggerated . E.g., Mr Stupak (the previous head of the \nlegal department) remained head of the claims department {Day11/6:15 -22} \n{Day11/8:5- 21} {Day11/25:8- 11} and his deputy, Mr Nakorchevsky also stayed on \n{Day13/5:16- 18}. Other examples of legal employees who stayed on include Ms \nStrelchenko, Ms Hryn, Mr Bondarenko, Ms Sizova, Ms Mazur and Ms Bagrova \n{Day11/11:2} - 13:12 , Hryn/6- 7 {B1/16/3}, Bondarenko/6- 7 {B1/11/2}. \n470. Moreover, t he claims at Pakhachuk/17 -18 {B1/1/6} that employees were loyal to Mr \nBogolyubov had no foundation. She could not explain in XX why she had referred to \nD1 and Mr Bogolyubov  indistinguishably when saying employees were loyal to them, \nother than that  they were “ both important political persons in Ukraine ” {Day13/1:23} -3:15 . \nShe accepted that she had no evidence of personal loyalty exhibited by Bank employees \nto Mr Bogolyubov  and was not personally acquainted with him .

She could not explain in XX why she had referred to \nD1 and Mr Bogolyubov  indistinguishably when saying employees were loyal to them, \nother than that  they were “ both important political persons in Ukraine ” {Day13/1:23} -3:15 . \nShe accepted that she had no evidence of personal loyalty exhibited by Bank employees \nto Mr Bogolyubov  and was not personally acquainted with him . The documentary \nevidence shows that she could distinguish between D1 and Mr B ogolyubov at the time , \ndescribing D1 as a “ god” {K5-C2/97.1/1}  (something she claimed not to remember in \nXX) {Day13/3:13- 15}.  \n(ii) P roduction of the Lafferty Spreadsheets \n471. The Bank has claimed repeatedly that the Lafferty Spreadsheets evidence Mr \nBogolyubov ’s control of the Bank , claiming that many individuals “ assisted Mr \nKolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov to respond to this claim, for example through the Lafferty spreadsheet exercise, which turned out to be a team of BOK and Primecap individuals headed by Tatiana \nGurieva .” {Day1/24:11 -16}. Once again it conflates D1 and Mr Bogolyubov. There is \nno evidence that Mr Bogolyubov  had any role in the preparation of the Lafferty \nSpreadsheets and this would be inconsistent with Mr Lafferty’s evidence that  “Mr \nKolomoisky personally and a team put together by him have been worki ng hard to establish where the \nmoney went ” {H2/8/5}  ¶17. The fact that these individuals were involved in the \nproduction of the spreadsheets cannot therefore “ confirm[]…the fact that BOK was the \nfirst and second defendants’ bank within the Bank.” {Day13/70:11 -15} (emphasis added). \nLater  in the trial, the Bank appeared to accept this , e.g. putting to Mr Steadman in XX \nthat the Lafferty Spreadsheets were compiled by “ a team identified and assembled by Mr \nKolomoisky, headed by Ms Gurieva ” {Day26/17:10- 11}. \n472. Equally, no conclusion as to Mr Bogolyubov’s knowledge of the ‘Scheme ’ can be \ndrawn from the fact he adopted the analysis in Lafferty 2 in his application to discharge the WFO. The Bank claims that  “either the second defendant was being opportunistic or he knew \nAA4/6/150\n147 \n all about the scheme too ” {Day13/29:22- 23}. Mr Bogolyubov  never said that the Lafferty \nSpreadsheet analysis reflected his own knowledge  of what went on (see his evidence \nat {H3/3/2}  ¶3) and there is nothing in Mr Lafferty’s evidence to suggest this is the \ncase. If it is “ opportunistic ” to rely upon someone else’s analysis to argue that there was \nno loss then so be it. \n(iii) “F raudulent ” New Loan claims  \n473. The Bank also claims that “ D1-2 ” were behind the issuance of the “Fraudulent” New \nLoan claims  in Sep/Oct  17: Bank Opening/139- 144 {AA2/1/ 63}. As so  often the \ncase, their argument as particularised focused on D1 {Day3/39:3- 7}. \n474. This claim  hung on the evidence of Ms Hryn and Mr Bondarenko, who gave evidence \nthat their signatures were forged on the final versions of some of the claims filed with \nthe Ukrainian Court. However, Ms Hryn’s  evidence in XX showed that the Bank \ncannot prove that they  were “ fraudulent ”. In particular, it transpired that: \n474.1  the Bank had authorised  the issuance of acceleration notices to the New \nBorrowers  (e.g. {E17/188/2} ) before the New Loan claims were issued \n{Day11/15:18 -23} {Day11/19:1 -15}; \n474.2  t he Bank had authorised the issuance of three New Loan claim forms  and the \npreparation of 33 further draft claim forms : Hryn/17-19 {B1/ 16/5 };  \n474.3  the Bank chose not to call the individuals (Mr Nakorchevskiy or Mr Stupak) who would know why an instruction was given to place 33 of the claims on the \n“back -burner” {Day11/20:4- 23}; \n474.4  Ms Hryn  could not answer whether someone else in the legal department could \nhave forged her signature while she was on sick leave {Day11/22:1 -17} and this \nis not covered in Mr Bondarenko’s statement {B1/11/3 -4}; and \n474.5  the acceleration notices were not withdrawn even after the supposed forgerie"}
{"start": 399000, "text": " the Bank chose not to call the individuals (Mr Nakorchevskiy or Mr Stupak) who would know why an instruction was given to place 33 of the claims on the \n“back -burner” {Day11/20:4- 23}; \n474.4  Ms Hryn  could not answer whether someone else in the legal department could \nhave forged her signature while she was on sick leave {Day11/22:1 -17} and this \nis not covered in Mr Bondarenko’s statement {B1/11/3 -4}; and \n474.5  the acceleration notices were not withdrawn even after the supposed forgeries \nwere noticed by the Bank {Day11/24:6- 13}. \n(iv) ‘Ex traction ’ of information from the Bank \n475. The Bank also claims that D1 and Mr Bogolyubov  were able to extract information \nfrom Bank employees  after Nationalisation, such as information pertaining to these \nproceedings. All but one of the examples relate to D1: {Day3/41:15} -43:22 , Bank \nOpening/145- 147 {AA2/1/65} . The only example given by the Bank which related  to \nMr Bogolyubov  was that in 2019 he sent D1 certain SWIFT messages confirming \nAA4/6/151\n148 \n payments from the Cyprus branch to Mr Shul man {Day4/145:12} -147:5 {K5-\nA2/3/102}  {K5-C1/89L}  - {K5-C1/92L} . The Bank said this showed that Mr \nBogolyubov was “ able to extract SWIFT confirmations from the Bank’s Cyprus bank”. \nHowever, the messages  post-date the commencement of the Shulman proceedings in \n2017, with disclosure in those proceedings being a possible  source. There is no \nevidence to suggest Mr Bogolyubov “ extracted ” the se documents from the Bank. \n(v) Ongoing relationship with Mr Kolomoisky and other individuals \n476. The Bank relies upon Mr Bogolyubov having an ongoing relationship with Mr \nKolomoisky and other relevant individuals post -Nationalisation. His relationship with \nMr Kolomoisky is dealt with in Section  D4 below. As a general point, post -\nNationalisation dealings cannot found a reliable inference for what was going on at the \ntime of the ‘Scheme’ and cannot make up for the lack of evidence of Mr Bogolyubov’s \ninvolvement therein. Moreover, the Bank cannot show that any of these dealings (such as there were) had an ything to do with the ‘Scheme’. Its attempts to suggest that they \ndid are risible e.g. the Bank’s reliance upon certain pre -Nationalisation members of the \nmanagement board  (including Mr Dubilet, Mr Yatsenko, Mr Novikov and Mr \nGorokhovsky) as well as Mr Bogolyubov  being invited by D1 to an event in Geneva \non 13 -14.2.18 {Day3/46:7} -47:4. The Bank speculates this was a meeting of “ members \nof the management board, heavily implicated in the misappropriation ”, “doubtless convened by D1 -2 \nand these ex -Bank employees to discuss D1 -2’s response to these proceedings ” (Bank \nClosing/163(5) {AA2/15/99} ) having apparently failed to notice that  D1’s invitation \nfor these individuals to join him at a Michelin starred restaurant on 14.2.18 coincide d \nwith his 55\nth birthday on 13.2.18 {I3/44/2}  ¶6. \n477. The Bank’s latest desperate attempt to say Mr Bogolyubov remained in control of the \nBank after 1.7.14 is to rely upon payments made by Grizal and Sunaltezza in 2017 -\n2019 to five ex -employees of the Cyprus branch: Bank Closing/54(3) {AA2/15/40} . \nThis has nothing to do with control of the Bank.  \nD3. ‘SUSPICIOUS ’ BEHAVIOUR  \n478. The Bank also relies upon a host of behaviour it says i s suspicious to claim that Mr \nBogolyubov was involved in the scheme. This largely focused on his means of \ncommunication, but the Bank also fixated for the first time during trial on the role of Mr Bogolyubov’s assistant, Mr Anischenko. \nAA4/6/152\n149 \n (1) Call records  \n479. The Bank claims that the fact of phone calls between D1, Mr Bogolyubov, Mr \nNovikov and Mr Dubilet in Feb-May 14 is significant as it corresponds with the time \nwhen the URPPs  bega n to be made  {Day5/57:10- 20}. No conclusions can be drawn \nfrom this:  \n479.1  First, the suggestion that a link can be made between the volume of calls and \nthe scheme undermines the Bank’s suggestion that the “Black” was s"}
{"start": 402500, "text": " role of Mr Bogolyubov’s assistant, Mr Anischenko. \nAA4/6/152\n149 \n (1) Call records  \n479. The Bank claims that the fact of phone calls between D1, Mr Bogolyubov, Mr \nNovikov and Mr Dubilet in Feb-May 14 is significant as it corresponds with the time \nwhen the URPPs  bega n to be made  {Day5/57:10- 20}. No conclusions can be drawn \nfrom this:  \n479.1  First, the suggestion that a link can be made between the volume of calls and \nthe scheme undermines the Bank’s suggestion that the “Black” was suspect as  \nit showed a need to communicate off the record.  \n479.2  S econd, it cannot be taken from the evidence there is that there was a particular \nflurry of calls in this period. As has been explained to the Bank previously , aside \nfrom records for 10.12.16 -27.1.17, records for the period 1.2.14- 1.6.14 are the \nonly logs for Mr Bogolyubov’s phone number within his control {L/69.0001} . \n479.3  T hird , there was significant upheaval in Ukraine at this time due to the \nRevolution of Dignity  and annexation of Crimea  {E7/180/16- 17}. If there was \na flurry of calls, this is a  more likely explanation.  \n479.4  F inally , there is actually very little overlap between the time period of these calls \n(1.2.14- 1.6.14) and the time period over which the URPPs  were made (2 8.5.14-\n1.9.14) .  \n(2) “Secretive” means of communication  \n480. Inconsistently with the existence of call records, emails and instant messages, the Bank claim s Mr Bogolyubov  tried to keep his contacts secret , that he “ used means of \ncommunication the purpose of which was to leave no documentary evidential tra il, in particular the \nBlack, speaking in person at meetings and by phone, and using instant messaging communication platforms which have not left records, such as Signal and Viber ” {Day4/59:2- 7}.   \n481. The Black : As has been explained to the Bank many times, the “Black” is not sinister . \nIt is a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) phone line, a commonly used technology \nproviding a secure and clear line {L/98.1/2} . As described by Mr Akkouh KC at the \nhearing on 12.1.23, “ It is a bit like a chambers p hone directory that allows you to type in a 4 -digit \nextension number and get whoever it is you want to speak to ” {G3/41/32} (p.123).  \n481.1  It was not even created by Mr Bogolyubov : Elliss5/78 {H3/22/14} , as the \nBank now appears to accept: Bank Closing/352(2) { AA2/15/211 }.  \nAA4/6/153\n150 \n 481.2  The Bank’s suggestion that there was “ extensive use ” by Mr Bogolyubov  \n{Day4/67:2}  is not borne out. The Bank has identified only five examples of \nreference s to the Black in chats between D1 and Mr Bogolyubov  over the \nperiod Dec  17-Feb 21, 12 between Mr Bogolyubov  and Mr Novikov over the \nperiod Jul 19 -May 21, one between Mr Bogolyubov  and Mr Anischenko and \nfour between Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Marangos  {AA6/17/3 -7}.  \n481.3  The Bank’s suggestion that the Black is a directory of “ lieutenants ” or persons \ninvolved in the ‘ Scheme ’ is also undermined by the fact that it contains \nindividuals who, on the widest view of relevance, are irrelevant . All individuals \nwho are even mentioned in documents uploaded to the trial bundle have been \nunredacted  {L/259.1.1} . Many of these individuals bear no relevance to the \nBank’s case and there remain 29  entries redacted at { K5-E/2.1 } and 54 \nredacted at { K5-E/3.1 } i.e. individuals not mentioned in any documents in the \nbundle .  \n481.4  By way of example, the Bank made much of the fact that Ms Melnikova \nappeared in the directory  of Jan 13  {K5-E/2.1/6} when she “ appeared to have \nbeen directly involved in the drawing -up of sham supply agreements ” relying upon an \nexample of 24.9 .13 {E2/123} . However, as the Bank noted, this  Black directory \nlisted Ms Melnikova’s phone as disconnected “ The following phones are off ” {K5-\nE/2.1/5-6}, undermining the Bank’s argument.  \n482.

{"start": 406000, "text": "lnikova \nappeared in the directory  of Jan 13  {K5-E/2.1/6} when she “ appeared to have \nbeen directly involved in the drawing -up of sham supply agreements ” relying upon an \nexample of 24.9 .13 {E2/123} . However, as the Bank noted, this  Black directory \nlisted Ms Melnikova’s phone as disconnected “ The following phones are off ” {K5-\nE/2.1/5-6}, undermining the Bank’s argument.  \n482. In-person meetings : It is bizarre to suggest that in person meetings are a “ means of \ncommunication the purpose of which was to leave no documentary evidential trail ”. They are used \nin almost all business settings.   \n483. P hone calls : Mr Bogolyubov  has disclosed the phone records that he has (see above). \nAgain, calls are used to communicate in almost all business settings.  \n484. Sig nal: Signal for iPhone was launched only on 29.7.14, initially with capacity for calls \nonly {E4/181.3} , expanded to support text communication on 2.3.15 { E8/57.1 }. It \nthus did not exist during the key period. Further, the suggestion that Signal does not \nleave records is incorrect. As explained in Enyo’s letter to HL , Enyo reviewed Mr \nAnischenko’s Signal messages (of which there were only four chats, all post -dating \n2016). None of the messages  (of which there was one exchanged with Mr Bogolyubov ) \nor attachments were disclosable {L/98.1/3}  {H3/22/15} ¶85. No Signal messages \nfrom Mr Bogolyubov ’s own account were accessible as explained at {L/110.1/3} . \nAA4/6/154\n151 \n Further, the fact that Mr Anischenko tells Mr Bogolyubov  that he will repeat a message \nby email if it was not received on Signal rather suggests that this was not a secret means \nof communication {K5 -A3/1/190} . \n485. Viber : Again, the Bank is incorrect to say that Viber left no records. Viber messages \nwere collected from Mr Bogolyubov ’s mobile device {A4/68/2} and were reviewed \n{A4/113/7} . No messages were disclosable and so none were disclosed. \n(3) Mr Anischenko ’s role \n486. The Bank now suggests that Mr Anischenko was involved in the ‘Scheme’ . This had \nnot been suggested before the commencement of trial and there is no evidence that \nhe was . The Bank appears to suggest he was a conduit “ involved effectively on a day -to-day \nbasis, communicating with those people who were operating the misappropriation: Novikov, Gurieva, \nMelnyk, et cetera .” {Day5/8:18- 21}. \n487. Mr Anischenko was employed by Mr Bogolyubov  as a personal administrator. As set \nout in Mr Anischenko’s witness statement in the Shulman  proceedings (relied upon by \nthe Bank { Day5/9:14} -10:12) “I became acquainted with Mr Bogolyubov and learned that it \nwould be of use to him to have someone administer his personal interests in London. I met with Mr Bogolyubov in or around December 2007 or January 2008 to discuss the position. In September \n2008, I  moved to London, where (amongst other roles) I worked with Mr  Bogolyubov until April \n2017, when I moved to Geneva ” {I3/23/1 -2} ¶3.  \n488. Mr Anischenko’s  communications demonstrate that his role was in managing Mr \nBogolyubov ’s personal assets and performing administrative roles. There is nothing \nillicit in his communications and nothing to do with the ‘Scheme’ .  \n489. The Bank claims that he communicated with Mr Bogolyubov  “typically by means that \nwouldn’t leave a record ” {Day5/8:11 -16}. These “secretive means” are  covered above . \nThe Bank claims in particular that his messages with Mr Bogolyubov  are full  of \nrequests to talk ( “can you talk ”). In fact, their messages  are mostly full of administrative \narrangements  (generally concerning the charter of Mr Bogolyubov’s plane) . Further, \nin a context where they shared an office and saw each other almost every day \n{I3/23/2}  ¶9 {Day5/10:4- 8} requests to speak are not suspect. T here are also many \nmissed calls in their WhatsApps (e.g. {K5 -A2/2/2} {K5- A3/5/66}; {K5- A3/5/455} \nand {K5-A3/5/580} ) undermining the suggestion that they were seeking to leave no \ntrace by using the “B"}

Further, \nin a context where they shared an office and saw each other almost every day \n{I3/23/2}  ¶9 {Day5/10:4- 8} requests to speak are not suspect. T here are also many \nmissed calls in their WhatsApps (e.g. {K5 -A2/2/2} {K5- A3/5/66}; {K5- A3/5/455} \nand {K5-A3/5/580} ) undermining the suggestion that they were seeking to leave no \ntrace by using the “Black”.  \nAA4/6/155\n152 \n 490. A good picture of Mr Anischenko’s role is shown by  his emails and instant messages . \nHis emails have been collected over the whole of the period 2013 -2016 and his instant \nmessages with key individuals (including Mr Marangos, Ms Markova and Mr Novikov) \nfor large chunks of that period {AA6/20} and the Bank has summarised many of his  \n(completely innocuous)  WhatsApps at  Bank Closing/Appendix C5 {AA2/17/44- 58}. \nIf Mr Anischenko acted as a “conduit” for the scheme, there would be evidence of this. Yet there is none.   \n491. WhatsApp messages  with Mr Bogolyubov : There are hundreds of pages of messages \nin the bundle at { K5-A2/1} {K5 -A2/2} {K5 -A3/1} {K5-A3/2} {K5 -A3/3} {K5 -\nA3/4}  {K5-A3/5}  covering the period 27.9.14- 20.1.22. The majority of these are \nadministrative ( e.g. arrangements about flight charters and meetings). There is nothing \nabout any ‘Scheme’ .  \n491.1  The Bank suggested that one  particular message was suspect : a message from \nMr Bogolyubov  on 12.10.14 at 11:33 saying “ Yes” {K5-A3/2/2 }. The Bank \nsubmitted that this is “ not, on its own, terribly informative...but it does show you how \nthey operated. So it’s offline. This is obviously responding to some question about Mr \nBogolyubov’s affairs at this point, October 2014, and it’s simply an answer which doesn’t \ntell you anyth ing. If one looks at page {K5 -A3/2/4}, you see the same sort of thing. So \nthey are keeping what’s actually being discussed unrecorded .” {Day5/15:14} -16:5 . In \nfact, what appears to have happened is that the response “ Yes” has been \nseparated from the question, which can be seen in a different document at { K5-\nA3/1/6 } where  Mr Anischenko asks  Mr Bogolyubov at 11:07 if he can accept \na charter request for Mr Bogolyubov’s private jet.  \n491.2  Contrary to the Bank’s submission {Day5/15:3 } -17:5, Mr Bogolyubov  and Mr \nAnischenko did  not avoid committing details to WhatsApp : see  e.g. {K5-\nA3/1/250}  {K5-A3/5/18 -20} { K5-A3/5/128} {K5 -A3/5/289} .  \n491.3  Mr Bogolyubov  and Mr Anischenko continued to  message in the same way \npost- Nationalisation, with requests to speak  and missed calls . This is simply \nhow they operated and nothing to do with any ‘Scheme’ {K5 -A3/5} .  \n492. WhatsApp chats with Mr Marangos : The Bank also makes much of the 1000 \nWhatsApps disclosed between Mr Anischenko and Mr Marangos  spanning 7.11.14-\n23.2.22  {K5-A3/7 L} {K5-A3/8L }, saying these are “ two lieutenants ” or “ a lieutenant and \na service provider to a lieutenant ” and that they are “ observing the same sort of protocol of keeping \nAA4/6/156\n153 \n things offline ” {Day5/20: 17-21} on the basis that  most of the messages are arrangements \nto speak and meet. Again, these messages generally show the making of administrative \narrangements between Mr Bogolyubov’s administrator and a CSP who it is accepted \nprovided services in relation to his assets . It is also incorrect that they “ keep things offline ” \n– on top of the 1000 messages,  there are over 30 emails in the trial bundle between Mr \nAnischenko and Mr Marangos. These  instant  messages give a good insight int o the \nlikelihood of Mr Anischenko being involved in a fraudulent ‘Scheme’  e.g. he has to ask \nMr Marangos how Mr Bogolyubov ’s interest in his yacht is held {K5 -A3/8L/165} .  \n493.

WhatsApp chats with Ms Markova : There are 181 pages of post -Nationalisation \nmessages in the bundle between Mr Anischenko and Ms Markova { K5-A3/9 } as well \nas one message from Aug  16 {K5-A3/10}. They contain, as  the Bank says “ either \nAnischenko seeking confirmation that banking actions had been done by M arkova, or Markova \nupdating Anischenko on ba nking matters .” However, the Bank also claims that “For the most \npart, the details are not mentioned, indicating that they were provided by phone – and of course both \nwere on the Black – or some other messaging cha nnel” {Day5/30:1 -7}. It is clear from the face \nof the messages that  a lot of “ detail” has been redacted due to irrelevance and \nconfidentiality , as it had been for payments concerning Grizal and Sunaltezza which \nwere recently unredacted in response to the Bank’s disclosure request  e.g. {K5-\nA3/9/ 104} {K5-A3/9/ 106}.  \n494. W hatsApp chats with Mr Novikov: There are 122 pages of messages in the bundle \nbetween Mr Anischenko spanning the period 4.10.15 -10.6.16 {K5-A3/11}  and \n21.6.17- 18.1.22 {K5-A3/12} {K5 -A3/13} . Again, the Bank relies upon there being \n“multiple messages to speak or meet ” e.g. {K5 -A3/13/30} when they are both going to be \nin the office {Day5/48:13} -49:9.  There are some such messages as well as \nadministrative messages, such as arranging flights and payments e.g. {K5-A3/11/4} \n{K5-A3/11/8} {K5 -A3/13/26} . \n495. E mails : Mr Bogolyubov  collected emails from Mr Anischenko across the whole \nrelevant time period  {AA6/20} , and messages have been disclosed where Mr \nBogolyubov has a right to them (see {A4/32/8} ¶¶17-20 {A4/131/9} ¶¶25-28). The \nBank’s suggestion that disclosure from his Gmail account did not cover 2013 -14 is \nwrong {A4/32/7} . Seven emails from his Gmail within that period are in the trial \nbundle: {E1/244}  {E1/246} {E1/249} {E1/260.2} {E1/268} {E3/198} {E3/315} .  \nAA4/6/157\n154 \n 496. His emails  over the relevant time period (up to 2016)  show him : (i) liaising with banks \nand CSPs about Mr Bogolyubov’s business interests e.g.  {E1/64} {E1/73} {E1/84} \n{E1/244} {E1/260.2} {E3/315}  {E10/95} {E12/189} ; (ii) assisting in the preparation \nof documents, such as resolutions and trust documents e.g.  {E13/48} {E13/150} \n{E14/256} ; (iii) providing information to Mr Bogolyubov  about his finances and \nbusinesses e.g. {E1/103}; ( iv) liaising with Mr Novikov to obtain Mr Bogolyubov ’s \nsignature on the Bank’s annual IFRS related party lists e.g.  {E14/258} {E14/264} ; and \n(v) providing a list of assets owned by Mr Bogolyubov ’s trusts to Mr Novikov \n{E12/215}.106  \n497. The Bank claims that there are “ exceptions where information slipped into the records ” \n{Day5/33:11 -12}; however, a review of the above emails shows no compunction \nabout including detail. Most importantly, there is nothing at all about the ‘Scheme’. \nD4. MR BOGOLYUBOV ’S RELATIONSHIP WITH MR KOLOMOISKY  \n498. The Bank relies upon Mr Bogolyubov ’s relationship with D1 to suggest that all \nevidence against D1 applies equally to Mr Bogolyubov . This is fallacious reasoning.  \n499. Mr Bogolyubov  has always accepted that D1 was a friend and business associate of his \nand the two were in regular communication during the relevant period and thereafter . \nThe Bank has wasted a lot of space straw -manning in its Closing to “establish” this \npoint . The Bank claims they communicated without leaving records; however, at the \nsame time, the Bank relies upon their regular WhatsApp communications (which are \navailable from Oct 15)  and call records (Bank Closing/65- 66) {AA2/15/46} .  \n500.

Further, as has always been acknowledged  (e.g. {I3/4/3}  ¶9), they have some common \ninterests in assets  and they use CSPs to manage these assets . It is also correct that they \nboth used nominees to hold their assets, relying upon structuring by PBC and Primecap. Yet, the Bank’s assertion that they hold “ virtually all of their most valuable \ncompanies ” jointly  (Bank Closing/59 ) {AA2/15/44}  is not correct.  The  Court should \nbe aware that the  Bank ’s Closing , Appendix C6 {AA2/17/59}  lists only jointly owned \nassets and omits all valuable assets in which Mr Bogolyubov alone was interested  e.g. \n \n106  T he Bank says this email relates to the asset transfer {Day5/54:3- 25}. This is not clear from the face of \nthe email; however, Mr Bogolyubov accepts that he transferred assets to the Bank in early 2016.  \nAA4/6/158\n155 \n Ghana Manganese (USD132m value in 2007) {I3/46/9}  and ConsMin ( USD200m \nvalue in 2016) { I3/35/5- 6}.107  \n501. They often took different  roles in respect of assets in which they were both interested . \nAs the Bank says, D1 “ is all over the detail of. He is a micromanager ” {Day3/54:9- 14} \n{Day13/151:1- 3} {Day14/13:1- 5}, Bank Closing/71 {AA2/15/50} . Mr Bogolyubov  \ndoes not say he had no involvement; however the difference in their engagement with \nthe detail is exemplified by contrasting D1’s messages with Ms Markova { K5-A1/39 }, \nMs Melnikova {K5 -A1/41} {K5 -A1/42/4} , Ms Chmona {K5 -A1/11} and Ms Gurieva \n{K5-A1/27} {K5 -A1/30} with Mr Bogolyubov ’s messages with Ms Markova  {K5-\nE/1}  {K5-A2/14} . Two further examples are  Eurotyre in which D1 expressly took \nthe lead {E13/54.1} { K5-E/1/3 } (line 5)  and certain negotiations over the merger of \nferroalloy interests, which Mr Bogolyubov explained in his Pinchuk witness statement \nwere conducted by Mr Kolomoisky (“ since I did not want to be party to any new business deal \nwith Mr Pinchuk” {I3/13/42}  ¶92. The Bank relied upon this witness statement at \n{Day4/122:17} - 125:4, but skipped over this paragraph.  \n502. How they managed these  assets is  in fact of little relevance. It is their respective roles \nin the Bank  that are key. Over the relevant period, D1 was far more closely involved \nin the Bank than Mr Bogolyubov , particularly after their agreement of 1.7.14. e.g. :  \n502.1  B ank employees said things about D1 such as “I ASSOCIATE IV WITH \nONLY ONE IV …He’s EVERYWHERE ” {K6/28/ 9} (23.10.13) ; “This is an \norder from IVK, so no one will resist there ” {K6/70.1/4}  (27.3.15) . Ms Taranenko \neven wrote a poem about him {K6/44.7/3}  (13.8.14) . The Bank claim s this is \n“of a piece with the absolute control we say D1/D2 wielded over the Bank” {Day3/36:10-\n12}. It is about D1 , with no equivalent for Mr Bogolyubov. \n502.2  Mr Kazantsev emailed Mr Sugak on 26.6.13 about the “ program initiated by the \nshareholder  of the Bank ” {E2/40.1} . The Bank said was “ a reference to loans that were \nbeing granted to D1/D2’s companies…So the shareholders are wanting this lending to be \ninitiated ” {Day3/33:19} -34:9. It is unclear what “ program ” was being referred \n \n107  Other examples from Mr Bogolyubov’s asset disclosure are LLC “Metalurgiyna Transportna \nKompaniya” (U/R asset 109) valued at USD 20-28m  {J4/5/ 123 and 50% interest in LLC Kalino \nMagnievy Plant (U/R asset 123) valued at USD 20.5m  {J4/5/140}. \nAA4/6/159\n156 \n to here; however, the reference is to “ shareholder ” not shareholders.

In context, \nit is most likely to refer to D1.  \n502.3  As described above, it was D1 who worked closely with the Bank and the NBU \non the restructuring and transformation. \n503. The same impression is given by the post- Nationalisation evidence:  \n503.1  A few years after Nationalisation, Ms Pakhachuk stated that many Bank employees “ believe that Kolomoisky is a god ” {K5-C2/97.1/1 }  \n503.2  It was D1 who sent Mr Novikov copies of the Kroll and AlixPartners Reports \n{Day14/84:13} -91:24 and a NBU presentation about the Bank {K5 -\nA1/47/28- 34}, and D1 to whom Mr Novikov sent a NBU resolution to \nconduct a search at the Bank {K5 -A1/47/20} . \n503.3  I t was  (on the Bank’s interpretation)  to D1  that Mr Dubilet  provided \n“confidential information from within the Bank ” and sent a criminal search warrant \nrelating to payments to Ingosstrakh {Day15/26:4} -27:1; D1 who Mr Dubilet  \nasked whether he would put pressure on EY {Day15/27:3- 22} and D1 and Mr \nDubilet who “ procured Ukrainian police to pressurise the Bank’s post -nationalisation \nCEO” : Bank Closing/86 {AA2/15/62- 64}.  \n503.4  It  is D1  who sends Mr Bogolyubov  information classified by the Bank as \n“leaked and confidential ” or relating to “ D1’s attempts to thwart the Bank bringing these \nclaims ” and D1’s “attempts to pressure the NBU into abandoning its banking reforms ”. \nAll the Bank has found to rely upon in relation to Mr Bogolyubov  is that he \nsent D1 publicly available  press articles : Bank Closing/69(2) , 70 {AA2/15/48}  \nand Appendix C3 {AA2/17/11}. \n503.5  As  to the Bank’s claims that D1 and Mr Bogolyubov “ cooperated together in efforts \nto prevent and obstruct the Bank pursuing this claim and to intimidate  those seeking to \ninvestigate it ” {Day4/121:21 -24}, all of the examples relied upon by the Bank \n(except for the Shulman SWIFTs dealt with above) concern D1’s  behaviour or \ninformation obtained by D1  (with him at most r elaying this to  Mr Bogolyubov ) \ne.g. {K5-A2/3/16} {K5 -C1/28} ; {K5-A2/3/17} {K5- C1/29} {K5 -C1/30} ; \n{K5-A2/3/19} ; {K5-A2/4} {K5 -C1/100}; {K5-A2/6/6} {K5 -C1/182} . The \nsame applies to the claim that D1 and Mr Bogolyubov  organised and paid for \nprotests outside the NBU as a “ joint enterprise ” {Day4/152:1} - 153:12 (repeated \nAA4/6/160\n157 \n at Bank Closing/ 70 {AA2/15/49} ). The article relied upon by the Bank stated \nthat the rallies were “ paid for by the ex -owners of banks withdrawn from the market, in \nparticular, Igor Kolomoiskyi ”. Mr Bogolyubov is not mentioned {K5 -C1/264} . \n503.6  It was D1  who was able to procure the preparation of the  Lafferty Spreadsheet s \nand for whom ex -Bank employees were prepared to give evidence. It was, on \nthe Bank’s case, D1 who tried to get Mr Yatsenko out of Ukraine before his \narrest {Day15/46:10} -53:7 with Mr Bogolyubov  seemingly only hearing about \nthis afterwards {K5-A1/10/2} . \n504. The Bank also noted that D1 appeared to obtain updates on companies owned by Mr \nBogolyubov {Day14/32:7} -42:18. The Bank’s submissions on D1 and Mr \nBogolyubov’s interests in these companies are not accurate ( e.g. as to Transit see \n{AA6/19/25} ); however, even to the extent D1 obtained updates on companies in \nwhich only Mr Bogolyubov had an interest, such as Grizal, this has no bearing on the case. Contrary to the Bank’s submissions, the messages do not show D1 giving instructions in relation to  these companies, but only receiving information ( e.g. on \nGrizal and Mr Bogolyubov’s account balances {K5 -A1/40/4} ).

D1 and Mr Bogolyubov  must be treated separately . Evidence about one cannot be \nread across to the other.  \nD5. M\nR BOGOLYUBOV DID NOT CONTROL THE ‘SCHEME ’ ENTITIES OR THEIR \nRELEVANT ACTIONS  \n506. Mr Bogolyubov  has admitted interests in certain of the entities said to have been \ninvolved in the ‘ Scheme ’. The relevant question for the Court  is not whether he had \n(often technical ) ownership interests, but whether he controlled the  relevant  entities \nand, more importantly, was involved in the relevant acts said to comprise the ‘S cheme ’. \nIn many cases it appears that companies that were at one time or in one respect real \ntrading companies were also used in the ‘Scheme ’ as fungible shell companies, without \nregard to any interest held by Mr Bogolyubov  and without  reference to him . A good \nexample is Uniks, covered in detail in Section  E. As above, much of the evidence the \nBank seeks to rely upon post- dates  the ‘Scheme’. This tells the Court nothing. In \nparticular, nothing can be read into the fact that Mr Bogolyubov has continued to use \nthe same CSPs or the same individuals in relation to his assets. \nAA4/6/161\n158 \n (1) Mr Bogolyubov’s assets  \n507. Mr Bogolyubov  has been open from the outset that his assets are held in complex \nstructures and that he uses CSPs in the management and ownership of these assets \nand structures e.g. {J3/2} {A4/8/7} . This has been the case long before any issues \narose in the Bank. As the Bank has helpfully summarised, Mr Bogolyubov has declared \ninterests in 233 assets, including 170 Ukrainian/Russian assets, the ownership chains \nof which involve 281 holding companies and 109 individuals {Day3/99:13- 17}.  \n508. He has been upfront in disclosing these asset structures, including providing details of \nnominee structures {J3/1} {J3/4} {J4/1} {J4/5} . His asset disclosure refers to many \nassets which are not in his name, including some of the companies the Bank has from \nthe outset said are involved in some way in the scheme ( e.g. Feral, Stalmag, Rudneks \nand Dorteks {J3/ 4/17 } {J3/4/22}  {J4/5/58 } {J4/5/161 }). This behaviour is not \nconsistent with Mr Bogolyubov  seeking to hide his interests in assets where unhelpful \nfor him or invoking “plausible deniability” where an asset is not in his name.  \n509. Equally, Mr Bogolyubov  has been upfront about acknowledging his interests in the \nBorrowers over the Relevant Period. This was not “ dragged out ” of him {Day1/28:24} . \nHe disclosed interests in 13 Borrowers in his original Defence of 17.1.20 {A1/17.2 /2} \n¶5(2)  with updates given and interests in six further Borrowers added proactively in \nearly 2023 {A1/19}. He also agreed to proceed for the purpose of this trial on the basis of D1’s position (as set out at {A1/17}) as to his ownership of various of the share \npledgor companies and pledgees {L/76.1} . Indeed, many of the matters relied upon \nin the Bank’s structure charts come from admissions made by Mr Bogolyubov : see e.g.  \n{K4-B3/1/2} .   \n510. Mr Bogolyubov has admitted these interests without hiding behind structures which, \nin the Bank’s own words, are “ byzantine and fiendishly complicated” {Day3/92:8 -9}. His \nuse of such structures long predates the  ‘Scheme’ , as demonstrated by spreadsheets \nfrom 2007 {E1/11P} and 2008 {E1/29P}  which set out the structures of some of Mr \nBogolyubov ’s a"}
{"start": 427000, "text": " many of the matters relied upon \nin the Bank’s structure charts come from admissions made by Mr Bogolyubov : see e.g.  \n{K4-B3/1/2} .   \n510.

His \nuse of such structures long predates the  ‘Scheme’ , as demonstrated by spreadsheets \nfrom 2007 {E1/11P} and 2008 {E1/29P}  which set out the structures of some of Mr \nBogolyubov ’s asset holdings, showing multiple layers and the involvement of CSPs. \nThe Bank cannot say that complex asset structures were put in place to hide Mr \nBogolyubov ’s invol vement in the ‘Scheme’ .  \n511. The complexity of Mr Bogolyubov ’s asset holdings is such that it needed to be \nexplained to him when relevant how underlying assets were held , as shown by emails \nconcerning Land M {E1/273} {E2/170.01}  and Hotel Split {E1/266.1} . Similarly, Mr \nAA4/6/162\n159 \n Anischenko (who helped in the management of Mr Bogolyubov ’s personal assets) \nsometimes needed to ask the CSPs how Mr Bogolyubov’s assets were held e.g. {K5 -\nA3/8L/165- 167}. In 2019, Mr Bogolyubov  asked  Mr Novikov of a company  “Is it \nours?”. Mr Novikov replied “ Not yours. And not even  our customer ” {K5-A2/15/33} . \n(2) Similarity of holding structures  \n512. The Bank says that the structures used to hold companies in which Mr Bogolyubov  \nadmits an interest are “ the same ” as those for the Borrowers and other companies \ninvolved in the ‘Scheme’  {Day1/27:22} -28:1. They  are not in fact “ the same”, \nalthough they do have shared characteristics, e.g.  some of the same holding companies \nand nominees are used. Indeed, this appears to be what the Bank means when it says \nthe structures are “ the same ” and it has backed away from this exaggeration in its \nclosing: Bank Closing/327(3) {AA2/15/183}.  \n513. The Bank claims that the “ only difference ” between companies where Mr Bogolyubov  \nadmit s an interest and those where he does  not is whether or not he admit s the \nexistence of an “ oral agreement ” with the relevant PBC beneficiaries at the end of the \nholding structure : “Where it’s their own assets, they aver an oral agreement, assets they admit; \nwhere they want to deny it, it stops with the same…PBC employees ” {Day3/124:6- 14}. It also \nrelies upon the common involvement of  PBC, Primecap and the CSPs , saying they  \n“played the same role in respect of the administration of the relevant entities because those companies \nwere also owned and controlled by the first and second defendants ” {Day3/127:23} - 128:2.  \n514. The Bank relies also upon holding companies and individual nominees appearing both \nin the structures of  relevant companies and Mr Bogolyubov ’s companies: Bank \nOpening/Schedule 7 {AA2/2/33- 47}. In this schedule it erroneously treats D1 and \nMr Bogolyubov together. 18 individuals  are not identified as having any connection to \nMr Bogolyubov. The same is the case for 59 holding companies (The fact that some \nof the companies are “Lafferty Spreadsheet Companies” is irrelevant insofar as Mr \nBogolyubov  is concerned.)  \n515. Moreover, the simple fact of common individual nominees and holding companies cannot be used to say that Mr Bogolyubov  owns any company where there is a strand \nof similarity in ownership structure with one of his own companies. In particular:  \n515.1  Mr Bogolyubov  has always admitted that CSPs assisted in structuring his asset \nholdings. The existence of common holding companies and nominees is \nconsistent with this and with the  companies being used as fungible shells.  \nAA4/6/163\n160 \n 515.2  Relatedly, it is not for Mr Bogolyubov  to identify “ plausible alternative beneficial \nowners, some other oligarch who was using the services of these very same PBC employees ” \n{Day3/131:11 -14} so as to explain how it is possible that PBC was involved in \nother corporate structures. As the Bank itself said “ They are nominees. Tha"}
{"start": 430500, "text": "ngs. The existence of common holding companies and nominees is \nconsistent with this and with the  companies being used as fungible shells.  \nAA4/6/163\n160 \n 515.2  Relatedly, it is not for Mr Bogolyubov  to identify “ plausible alternative beneficial \nowners, some other oligarch who was using the services of these very same PBC employees ” \n{Day3/131:11 -14} so as to explain how it is possible that PBC was involved in \nother corporate structures. As the Bank itself said “ They are nominees. That’s the \nnature of PBC’s and Primecap’s business .” {Day3/131:10- 11}. \n515.3  If Mr Bogolyubov  had wished to use the cover of “ plausible deniability ” to claim \nhe did not own companies in which he did have an interest, he would have had \nthe same incentive in relation to his WFO  asset disclosure more generally . Yet \n(using the Bank’s calculations)  he included 109 assets worth almost USD 500m \n{Day3/101:24- 25} in his disclosure  as held pursuant to “ oral agreements ” and \nincluded 79 Ukrainian assets valued at USD 470m held via structures involving 20 PBC individuals {Day3/110:5- 11}. As Mr Bogolyubov has recently \nexplained the “oral agreements ” in respect of certain assets (those valued in excess \nof USD1m) were in fact recorded in writing : Bogolyubov7/6  {H3/26/2} .  \n515.4  The contemporaneous asset schedules upon which the Bank relies contain some  entities part -owned by third- party UBOs alongside D1 and Mr \nBogolyubov : see e.g. {E1/11P/19 -24} {E1/29P/2 -4}. Similarly, D1’s asset \ndisclosure  contains some companies he 100% owns structured using holding \ncompanies and nominees e.g. Podil Nerukhomist LLC {J2/3/38} , \nTekhinsevice Group {J2/3/96} , Veltex LLC {J2/3/10 7}. So it cannot be said \nthat Mr Bogolyubov owns all of these companies.  \n516. At the end of the day, the shared nominees and holding companies tell the Court \nnothing about who ultimately owns or controls relevant entities . They  are consistent \nwith the simple fact of the same CSPs being used to structure the holdings.  \n(3) Ability of Bank employees to change directors and UBOs  \n517. The Bank also relies upon the fact that its  employees were able to recommend and \nprocure changes to the PBC directors and UBOs of the Borrowers and Intermediary \nBorrowers as showing that those companies were owned and controlled by D1 and \nMr Bogolyubov : Bank Closing/329 {AA2/15/185} . The questions  of why these \nchanges were suggested and how they were made has been explored above ( Section  \nC6). The fact that Bank employees were able to make such changes is apiece with these \nbeing fungible shell s used by the B ank for its own purposes.  \nAA4/6/164\n161 \n 518. The same can be said for the  Bank ’s claims that the fact that Mr Luchaninov \nconsidered that Bank employees could change the directors of the 24 Borrowers is \n“strong evidence of D1 -2’s ownership of the 24 Borrowers ” (Bank Opening/293(3)) \n{AA2/1/124} and that changes to directorships of companies in which  D1 and/or \nMr Bogolyubov had interests could only have happened with their blessing {Day2/41:16} -42:4. Moreover, t here is no evidence that Mr Bogolyubov even knew \nof this and no suggestion in the Luchaninov Email that he needed to be or was going to be asked about any changes. Further, the Bank chose not to adduce evidence from \nMr Luchaninov on how the changes were ma de and so cannot now speculate. The \nBank’s reliance on a Skype message from Ms Travk ina saying that she could tell Ms \nBuchko if new directors had been appointed for  Uniks and Rudneks  – “for these \nbusinesses, information is provided only by management ” {K6/51/2 -3} - suggests nothing \nabout Mr Bogolyubov’s knowledge. He was not “ management ”.   \n(4) Witnesses’ baseless assumptions of control  \n519. Mr Luchaninov and Ms Lozytska  again  included in their witness statements baseless \nassumptions or suspicions as to Mr Bogolyubov ’s control , this time  of relevant entities. \nAs with their ‘evidence’ on control of the Bank, t h"}

Mr Luchaninov and Ms Lozytska  again  included in their witness statements baseless \nassumptions or suspicions as to Mr Bogolyubov ’s control , this time  of relevant entities. \nAs with their ‘evidence’ on control of the Bank, t hese unravelled  in XX .  \n520. Mr Luchaninov stated at paragraph 13 of his witness statement {B1/3/5}  that he \n“understood at the time ” that the Bank’s “ strategic customers ” within BOK were “ companies \nwithin Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov’s wider business group ”. It transpired in XX that Mr \nLuchaninov referred to both D1 and Mr Bogolyubov  in the same breath  in this \nparagraph  solely on the basis that “ when we created lists of related parties, we received the \ninformation saying us that some clients were owned by Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov or - - \neither jointly or separately ”. This was so despite the fact that , as he accepted, he understood \nthat D1 and Mr Bogolyubov  did have some separate interests {Day9/56:10} -57:3. His \nevidence about D1 and Mr Bogolyubov ’s supposed “ wider business group ” is therefore \nunreliable and should not be ascribed any weight.  \n521. Ms Lozytska stated at paragraph 49 of her witness statement { B1/6/13} that:  \nAt the time of the above emails, I suspected it was probably the case that the changes \nto the corporate structures and tasks requested in those emails were able to be requested \nby the Bank because, in reality, the companies in question were ultimately bene ficially \nowned or controlled by Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov who were also the \nshareholders of the Bank. At that time, however, my job was only to obtain legal \ndocuments from BOK clients, input that data into the Bank’s systems, and identify \nclients whi ch showed signs of being related to the Bank on the basis of the documents \nprovided. It was not my job to raise suspicions or start investigations in respect of \nAA4/6/165\n162 \n companies which, on the face of their documents, did not appear to be related to Mr \nKolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov.  \n522. However, she accepted in XX that she did not know how changes to the beneficiaries \nor directors of companies were secured: “ I personally do not know who was giving the orders \nwith regard to the changes, yes .” {Day10/17:18} -20:11 . When paragraph 49 was put to her, \nshe ultimately accepted that there was no evidential basis for it:  \nQ. Thank you.  You have no evidence, do you -- and I'm going to deal specifically with \nMr Gennadiy Bogolyubov --  you have no evidence, do you, that he played any role \nin making changes to the corporate structures that you've referred to here?  \nA.  I am not referring to any ownership structures in this specific paragraph.  In \nthis paragraph, my Lord, I'm saying that since I was cc'd in electronic \ncorrespondence, in electronic correspondence some issues were discussed \nwith regard to the change of corporate ownership structure and therefore I \nassumed that indeed these -- not specifically these clients but in principle \nthe clients that were taking part in electronic correspondence are related to Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov .  \nQ. I'm asking you a different question.  You had no evidence that Mr Gennadiy \nBogolyubov played any role in making or approving the changes to the corporate \nstructures that you are referring to here?  \nA. Yes, I would agree with such statement.                           {Day10/20:17}  -21:11  \n523. This lack of evidential basis also undermines her assumptions stated at Lozytska/29 \n{B1/6/9}  (“I assumed at the time that many of these companies were actually under the control of \nthe former shareholders of the Bank for the reasons I will explain below” ) and Lozytska/42 \n{B1/6/11} (“Although I cannot say wi"}

Once more, the Bank’s witness ‘evidence’ on control should be ignored.  \n(5) No control over the Borrowers  or Intermediary Borrowers  \n525. The Bank’s general submissions on control (such as regarding similarity of holding structures and related party matters) have been dealt with above. Mr Bogolyubov  refers \nthe Court to D2 Opening/154 -164 (including Tables 2 and 3) where he  has \nsummarised his interests (insofar as they exist) in the Borrowers over the Relevant Period, provided explanations for the only communications regarding Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers in which he was personally involved and responded to a number of the Bank’s submi ssions {AA4/1/60} - 70. \n526. Here too the Bank seeks  to use evidence applicable only to Mr Kolomoisky against Mr \nBogolyubov. For example, it  relies upon the fact that Mr Kolomoisky  apparently \nadmitted  to owning or controlling  Celastrina in the Pinchuk proceedings to say that \nAA4/6/166\n163 \n “it’s to be inferred that Celastrina was owned by the first and second defendants or controlled by the \nfirst and second defendants ” {Day14/11 1:2} -113:23. The Bank’s continued conflation of \nMr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov smacks of desperation in the face of a lack of \nevidence against Mr Bogolyubov .  \n527. As to the further points raised by the Bank in relation to Mr Bogolyubov:108 \nPoint raised by the Bank  Response  \n(1) Some Borrowers (AEF, Rapit, \nDorteks, Inkom , Uniks), \nIntermediary Borrowers \n(Autotradeinvest, Flore ks) and \nother relevant companies (such as \nshare pledgors (Derling, \nUkrinterinvest) and companies \ninvolved in the Asset Transfer \n(Alpina, Ardena, Artis, Basis \nTsentr, Zirka)) as well as some \nshareholders of Borrowers and \nIntermediary Borrowers are \nincluded i n an asset list  \nspreadsheet  prepared by Mr \nAnischenko in 2007 {E1/11P}.  \nThe Bank claims that this \ncontradicts Mr Bogolyubov ’s \ndenials of  interests {E1/11P} and \nis “powerful evidence ” of the position \nin 2013 {Day5/91:6} - 94:22.  {E1/11P} is a  “Property Report” \nspreadsheet is dated “[ ] June 2007” which  \n“reflect[s] the corporate ownership structure of \nenterprises in the industrial sector as of the date \nindicated on the title page ” (i.e. Jun 07)  \n{E1/11P/ 1-2}.  \nIt does not set out the corporate ownership \nstructures of any of the companies \nmentioned by the Bank, merely listing them \nas companies within certain industries \n{E1/11P/3 -9}.  \nFurther, it  lists interests as at Jun 07. Nothing \ncan therefore  be drawn from it in terms of \ncorporate ownership structures during the \nRelevant Period, nor can it be said that it  \ncontradicts the interests Mr Bogolyubov has \nadmitted/denied, pleaded in relation to the \nRelevant Period.   \nIn addition, the spreadsheet is not solely \nconcerned with Mr Bogolyubov ’s ownership \nof companies.

The Bank claims this \ndocument “ confirms, from Mr \nAnischenko in 2015, an economic \ninterest of [D2] ” in various relevant \ncompanies and is inconsistent \nwith Mr Bogolyubov ’s denials of \ninterest or substantial interest in \nthose companies {Day5/109:8} -\n113:7  Although the document is dated 2015, it sets \nout how Mr Bogolyubov  acquired interests \nin various industries in the early 2000s  (well \nbefore the Relevant Period) {E18/181/12 -\n30}. In respect of some companies, it  \nexpressly states that the holdings have since been restructured ( e.g. in respect of OGOK \nand MGOK {E18/181} pp.26 and 30). In \nfact, the companies relied upon by the Bank  \nhad been “shuffled out” of the structure s \nbefore  \nthe Relevant Period as shown by \n{E1/11P/14 -18} (dated Jun 07).  \nMr Bogolyubov’s asset disclosure also shows \nthat the structure of his holdings in in the \nrelevant underlying companies had changed  \n{E18/181/12} vs {J4/5/139}  (Dniproazot), \n{E18/181/27} vs {J4/5/144} (MGOK), \n{E18/181/23} vs {J4/5/144} (OGOK) and \n{E18/181/18} vs {J4/5/145} (ZZF).   \nIt therefore has no bearing on his interests in \nthe Relevant Period. \n(3) Some companies in which Mr \nBogolyubov has admitted an \ninterest were included as non-\nrelated parties in the Bank’s y/e \n2014 related party list , including \nsome Borrowers (Uniks and \nDorteks), Intermediary Borrowers \n(Autotradeinvest), share pledgees \n(Derling) and asset transferors \n(Zirka Bukovelyu) {E9/195.4}  \n{Day5/119:1} - 121:8 . The Bank has not stated what it says should \nbe drawn from this in terms of Mr \nBogolyubov ’s control of any relevant \nentities. It has not even explained how it is \nsaid these companies met the test to be \nincluded as related parties in 2014.  \nFurther,  all of these companies were added \nto the Bank’s IFRS related party list in 2015 \nor early 2016: Dorteks {K3 -E/95P/25} , \nUniks {K3 -E/94/11} , Autotradeinvest {K3 -\nE/100P/33} , Derling {K3-E/104P/35} , \nZirka Bukovelyu {K3-E/94/11} . \n528. None of the points raised by the Bank show anything about Mr Bogolyubov ’s \nsupposed control of the Borrowers or Intermediary Borrowers. Rather , the documents \nrelied upon demonstrate the complexity and confusion surrounding his asset holding \nstructures. {E18/181} shows  especially  clearly how companies were used in complex \n \nD2 had any interest in Spektr, rather that a company in which Mr Bogolyubov  was interested bought \nshares in ZZF from Spektr {E18/181/18}. \nAA4/6/168\n165 \n multi -layered holding structures, where the real asset ( e.g. a ferroalloy company) was at \nthe bottom of the structure.

A new schedule produced by the Bank of “ connections  between D1 -2 and the Borrowers”: \nBank Closing/Appendix G2 {AA2/21/11} is notable for the lack of evidence within \nit, and its heavy reliance on borrower “ project ” labels.  \n(6) No control over the New Borrowers  \n530. Mr Bogolyubov  has addressed the factors relied upon by the Bank for control of the \nNew Borrowers at D2 Opening/165 and Table 4 {AA4/1/68} {AA4/1/71} . There is \na stark absence of evidence relied upon by the Bank in relation to Mr Bogolyubov’s \nalleged ownership and control of these entities.  \n531. At trial, the Bank focused heavily on the idea that the New Borrowers were selected \nfor use in the Transformation despite being shell companies, with no “ real assets or real \nbusiness ”, the New Loans were approved by the “ usual acolytes ” on the ECC and the \nterms of the loans were “ wholly uncommercial ” {Day2/54:14- 19}, 56:4- 6 {Day3/90:17 -\n22} {Day16/73:15} -74:25, 90:22- 25. As explained above, and accepted by Ms \nRozhkova, Mr Bogolyubov  was not involved in the Transformation beyond limited \nformal steps he was required to take as a shareholder or  member  of the Supervisory \nBoard. There is no evidence of his involvement in the choice of New Borrowers or \nissuance of the New Loans. Accordingly, the fact and terms of participation of  the \nNew Borrowers cannot be relied upon against him .  \n532. Further, the Bank once again sought to rely upon the Fraudulent Enforcement \nProceedings and the New Borrower proceedings against “ D1-2 ” despite the fact that \nthe only factors they rely upon relate to D1 ( e.g. D1’s skeleton argument {G2/22/63} ) \n{Day16/92:7 } -100:11 . The Bank’s failure to prove its case on the  Fraudulent \nEnforcement Claims has been addressed above  ¶474 .  \n(7) No control over the Defendant Suppliers  \n533. Mr Bogolyubov  dealt with the facts relied upon by the Bank for his alleged control of \nthe Defendant Suppliers at D2 Opening/Table 5 {AA4/1/73} . There is a great deal \nof detail in the Bank’s submissions on this point; however, it can be cut through by \nnoting two crucial points: ( i) there is no evidence that Mr Bogolyubov was involved in \nany actions of the Defendant Suppliers in relation to the ‘Scheme’ (or at all); and ( ii) \nAA4/6/169\n166 \n moreover, as shown above ( Section B ), the Bank’s case that there was a \nmisappropriation to the benefit of Mr Bogolyubov through URPPs  to the Defendant \nSuppliers has fallen apart.  This is sufficient to dispose of the need to deal with \nquestions of control; however, some of the Bank’s arguments are nevertheless \naddressed below.  \n534. First, the vast majority of the evidence relied upon by the Bank relates only to D1 : \nBank Closing/¶9 , Section G6 {AA2/15/200} , Bank Opening/Section G2 \n{AA2/1/133}. The Bank persists in seeking to use some of this evidence  against Mr \nBogolyubov , e.g.: \n534.1  i t submits that WhatsApp messages showing Ms Markova sending D1  \nSanderlyn and Versala’s bank balances and asking D1  to approve their \npayments {K5 -A1/39} {K5 -A1/40} demonstrate  that D1 and Mr Bogolyubov \ncontrolled Sanderlyn and Versala , which  paid D 6-8’s legal fees  {Day14/34:18} \n-42:11 . This evidence does not relate  to Mr Bogolyubov. The attempts to bridge \nthis gap by relying  on Ms Markova  having links to Mr Bogolyubov, e.g.  that she \nsent D1 some of Mr Bogolyubov’s bank account balances and was  paid by \nSunal tezza (Bank Closing/¶54( 5) {AA2/15/40 }) cannot change the fact that \nthe messages show D1 only  being asked to approve the payments;  \n534.2  the Bank appears to have backtracked from its Opening, where it suggested for \nthe first "}

The attempts to bridge \nthis gap by relying  on Ms Markova  having links to Mr Bogolyubov, e.g.  that she \nsent D1 some of Mr Bogolyubov’s bank account balances and was  paid by \nSunal tezza (Bank Closing/¶54( 5) {AA2/15/40 }) cannot change the fact that \nthe messages show D1 only  being asked to approve the payments;  \n534.2  the Bank appears to have backtracked from its Opening, where it suggested for \nthe first time that Mr Bogolyubov  was involved in the 2016 Arrest Orders, and \nGPO Proceedings, not pleaded against Mr Bogolyubov  and where the entirety \nof the evidence cited related solely to D1: Bank Opening/Section G2(3) (c) \n{AA2/1/143 -144}.  In oral submissions, these points were raised by the Bank \nonly as points they would have put to D1 {Day16/9:21} -15:17 (2016 Arrest \nOrders) and {Day16/28:3- 24} (GPO) . See also Bank Closing/345(7) \n{AA2/15/202} ; \n534.3  however, it maintains  that the Defamation Proceedings were initiated by D1 \nand Mr Bogolyubov  “to seek to acquire a basis on which the first and second defendants \ncould argue and indeed did argue that if proceedings were started in England in respect of the misappropriation, any English proceeding should be stayed on lis alibi pendens on that basis .” \n{Day16/15:21} -28:2.  Yet, the evidence relied upon near -exclusively concerns \nD1. In particular, it  was only D1 that filed a standalone defamation claim in \nAA4/6/170\n167 \n Ukraine: see Bank Opening/Section G2(3)(b) {AA2/1/141}. There is nothing \nto suggest Mr Bogolyubov was involved. \n535. Second, the Bank relies on the UBOs of D3 -8 also having links to Mr Bogolyubov , to \nthe Bank and to Primecap. The flaws in the argument of “common nominees” have  \nbeen addressed above. Moreover, the Bank acts on the erroneous basis that any \nindividual other than D1 or Mr Bogolyubov must be a “ stooge”. E.g., it claims that Mr \nKiperman must hold D7 and D8 for D1 and Mr Bogolyubov as he is a “stooge”. \n{Day16/48:1} -52:13, relying upon {E15/89.1} . Yet this article (about Mr Kiperman’s \nfather)  shows Mr Kiperman is  a substantial businessman in his own right : see \n{E15/89.1/33} .  \n536. T hird , as to Mr Bogolyubov ’s supposed control of D3 -5, the Bank has scraped \ntogether  paltry evidence against Mr Bogolyubov :  \n536.1  the fact D3-5 were apparently  managed initially by the Bank’s Investment \nDepartment and then Primecap {Day16/28:25} -42:4 does not show they were \ncontrolled by Mr Bogolyubov. \n536.2  the Bank has only identified one purported actual link between one of D3 -8 \nand Mr Bogolyubov . This is that Collyer appears in the 2008 corporate \nstructure spreadsheet at {E1/29P/2 -3}. The Bank says this shows Collyer held \nassets for Mr Bogolyubov  {Day16/30:9- 13}. However, Mr Bogolyubov  is not \nidentified on the spreadsheet as the UBO of Collyer. Further, other UBOs are \nalso identified on the spreadsheet, including “ IVK” (D1) and “ IGM”. In any \nevent, this shows nothing about whether Mr Bogolyubov  controlled C ollyer or \nabout ownership during the Relevant Period . \n536.3  the Bank otherwise relies upon alleged links between Mr Bogolyubov and D3 -\n5’s Alleged Principals (despite the Bank’s denial that D3- 5 in fact acted as \nagents for the Alleged Principals ): RRRRAPOC/12A {A1/2/4}) \n{Day15/155:4} -166. This boils down to more of the same  points addressed \nabove , such as  common ality of  companies and nominees appearing in Mr \nBogolyubov’s corporate structures  and references in corporate structure \nspreadsheets of 2007 and 2008. None of these points show Mr Bogolyubov \nhaving any connec tions to D3 -5. \n536.4  the Bank claims that the only plausible source of funding of D3 -5 is D1 and \nMr Bogolyubov  {Day1 6/4:5} -9:14.

Mr Bogolyubov is \nnot mentioned in these invoices {E17/242.6} {E17/242.7} . \n536.5  the fact of payments  Sunaltezza to three purported UBOs of D3 -5 does not \nshow that Mr Bogolyubov controlled these companies {AA2/14/7}. \n537. Fourth, the Bank’s submissions regarding Mr Bogolyubov’s supposed control of D6 -\n8 contained a number of inaccuracies , already corrected by D2  at {AA6/19/28} . The \nmost egregious of these was the Bank’s claim that “ your Lordship has already concluded that \nthere’s evidence to suggest that  [the funding for D6 -8] was advanced on behalf of the first and \nsecond defendants ” {Day16/45:17- 19} where the finding in fact made was just that there \nwas “ some prima facie evidence that much of the money that has so far been made available to assist \nin the funding of the case on behalf of the third to eighth defendants emanates from entities or persons \nwith links to the first and second defendants ” {A5/22/8}  ¶22. As shown above, the only \nevidence on funding relied upon by the Bank relates only  to D1.  Other of its \nsubmissions are more of the same e.g. the apparent ability of Bank employees to alter \nthe b eneficial owner of Rossyn in the context of related parties {E12/179.01} \n{E12/179.02} . As explained above, this shows nothing about Mr Bogolyubov’s \ncontrol, who was not even mentioned in the email.  \n(8) No control over Primecap  \n538. Mr Bogolyubov explained his relationship with Primecap in Opening/170 -178 \n{AA4/1/76}. He accepts that he used Primecap to manage his assets and has disclosed \nservices agreements showing this  {E10/248.1} {E17/268} . He has also already \ncorrected the Bank’s submissions about his alleged ownership of an interest in \nPrimecap through Ralkon at  {AA6/19/10 }.  \n539. There is a wealth of evidence that Primecap was involved in the administration of \nwhatever was in fact going on at the Bank, ‘Scheme’ or otherwise. Y et there is no \nevidence that Mr Bogolyubov had or exercised any control over Primecap in this \nregard or at all. The Bank  claims that Primecap must have been  getting instructions \nfrom Mr Bogolyubov ( and Mr Kolomoisky ) in relation to the ‘Scheme’ ; however , the \ndocuments clearly show  that Primecap obtains instructions from PBC (as the Bank \naccepts {Day14/93:14} -95:13) , with PBC  in turn obtaining instructions from Bank \nemployees (see e.g. in relation to the Uniks example at Section E  below). Instructions \ndo not flow from Primecap; therefore, the Bank’s suggestion that Mr Bogolyubov \nAA4/6/172\n169 \n controlled the ‘Scheme ’ through Primecap and “ use[d] it…to effect the misappropriation ” \n{Day5/88:7- 8} does not make sense.  \n540. The Bank’s submissions  on the control of Primecap largely focus on Mr Bogolyubov’s \nrelationship with Mr Novikov, which was addressed at D2 Opening/176 {AA4/1/77}  \nand above  and apply here mutatis mutandis . The picture of the relationship between Mr \nNovikov and Mr Bogolyubov can also usefully be contrasted with the evidence as to \nthe relationship between Mr Novikov and Mr Kolomoisky. In particular:  \n540.1  It is Mr Kolomoisky who receives the text relied upon by the Bank as showing \nthat he approved a payment of Primecap’s taxes and social insurance  {K5 -\nA1/42/4}  - “and he does so because he owns and controls Primecap ” {Day14/17:4- 7}. \n540.2  It is Mr Kolomoisky who shares what the Bank says are  leaked documents with  \nMr Novikov and Mr Kolomoisky whom Mr Novikov “tips off” about an order \nfor the search of the Bank’"}

The sole “ damning ” piece of evidence relied upon by the Bank in relation to Mr \nBogolyubov is that he emailed Mr Anischenko in Dec 16 saying that Ms Markova had \nmoved to Primecap: Bank Closing/131 {AA2/15/84} . It is unclear how this is \n“damning ” or relevant at all where Mr Bogolyubov accepts that he dealt with both Ms \nMarkova and Primecap in relation to his assets.  \n542. The Bank also made a new suggestion that Mr Anischenko was a “ conduit for Primecap \ninstructions ” {Day5/84:7} - 85:7. As the Bank ultimately accepted “ this may simply not be \nin dispute -- is that Anischenko was a conduit between Mr Bogolyubov and Primecap; Primecap \nadministering, as he admits, large numbers of his admitted assets. ” That is as far as the point \ngoes. Mr Anischenko assisted Mr Bogolyubov with his personal assets , with which  \nPrimecap also assisted Mr Bogolyubov. There is no evidence that Mr Anischenko had anything to do with Primecap’s role in the ‘Scheme’. \n543. The Bank’s attempts to link Mr Bogolyubov to Primecap through its 11 employees to \nwhom ownership was transferred in 2011 are equally misconceived .\n110 The majority of \n \n110  Also misconceived is the Bank’s assertion that the only documents relating to the transfer to Primecap’s \nemployees date from 2013: Bank Closing/129(2)  {AA2/15/83}.

The \nBank could not provide any evidence that it suggested linked Mr Bogolyubov to four \nof the employees (Mr Gryshchov, Ms Armashova, Mr Ignatiuk and Mr Gninenko).  \nThe Bank also exaggerated the evidence it had, e.g. saying that Mr Kotlyarenko had \ngiven evidence in the Pinchuk proceedings that he “ was always working on the instructions \nfrom Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov but he received them directly from Mr Novikov” and \n“admits frequently receiving instructions from D1 and D2” {Day14/101 :4-7}. In fact , Mr \nKotlyarenko’s evidence was that he did not receive instructions from them {I3/16/2}  \n¶6: \nDuring my years at PrivatBank, Prime Capital and Primecap, though I worked on a \nnumber of M&A transactions and corporate restructurings for either the First Defendant (Mr Bogolyubov) or the Second Defendant (Mr Kolomoisky), I do not recall receiving instructions directly from either of them. Throughout the period relevant to these proceedings, when working on transactions connected with Mr Kolomoisky and/or Mr Bogolyubov, I received my instructions directly from Mr Timur Novikov, who has a close working rel ationship with both Defendants.   \n(9) No control over PBC  \n544.

This interest was often held in fractions through a number of companies, and appears to be a techni cal interest held as a result of the various complex and \nchanging corporate holding structures put together for Mr Bogolyubov . As the Bank \nput it, there is a “ tale of coming and going of a relatively small percentage interest in PBC ” \n{Day5/66:25} -67:1. The disclosure of these  fractional  interests is once again \ninconsistent with Mr Bogolyubov attempting to use “ plausible deniability ” to hide his \n‘true’ connections to PBC.  \n545. The Bank claims it is unrealistic that those managing Mr Bogolyubov’s interests would have “ acquired and given away tiny interests through labyrinthine structures in this way ” \n{Day5/67:13- 14}. However, it is not unrealistic that these small interests would have \ncome and gone as a side effect of dealings with companies higher up in the corporate structure for the purpose of restructuring other of Mr Bogolyubov ’s assets. The Bank’s \nAA4/6/174\n171 \n suggestion that Mr Bogolyubov  has admitted “ the minimum that he needs to admit to explain \nthe fingerprints that he thinks there are \" {Day5/67:17- 18} is a bad one. There is no \ndocumentary evidence suggesting Mr Bogolyubov  owned any interest in PBC and no \n“fingerprints ” driving him to have to admit one. \n546. The Bank’s claim that Mr Bogolyubov ’s “fingerprints are over all the companies  that are the \nregistered shareholders of PBC at the time of the misappropriation ” {Day5/68:20- 22} (emphasis \nadded) is exaggerated. Mr Bogolyubov  has pleaded interests in four of the seven \nregistered shareholder companies over the Relevant Period (20.11.13 -20.7.15). These \ninterests are generally small and fluctuate:111 \nMakros  6.07% indirect interest from 21.1.14- 20.3.14  \n2.36% indirect interest from 21.3.14- 27.11.14  \n{A2/39.4/13}  \nArkhon  21.66% indirect interest throughout the Relevant \nPeriod {A2/39.4/10}  \nAgroprom (shareholder \nfrom 2014)  Nominal indirect interest from 1.4.13- 12.6.13.  \n24.38% indirect interest from 20.11.13 – 20.3.14  \n9.5% indirect interest from 21.3.14 to the end of the \nRelevant Period {A2/33/3 -5} \nMizar (listed as a \nshareholder in 2011 and \n2015, but not in 2014)  3.04% indirect interest throughout the Relevant \nPeriod {A2/39.4/10}  \n547. In contrast to this, D1 has accepted that he indirectly owned a 24.79% interest in PBC \nbetween Sep 13 and Feb 14 when he was the 100% UBO of Songo, it having been \ntransferred to him by Mr Melnik and other partners or employees of PBC {A2/31.1/5 -\n6}. The Bank’s position is the “ the first defendant …already owned and controlled Songo and \nPBC” before this {Day14/157:24- 25} (emphasis added) .  \n548. The Bank’s submissions on the ownership and control of PBC are replete with errors. \nMost notably, it claimed  that Songo (with its 24.79% interest in PBC) was “ transferred \n[in Sep 13]  to other D1/D2 companies…Circle Stone, Destro, Fernola, Liberty Venture and \nVetura. Those are admitted D1/D2 companies .” {Day14/158:10- 14}.

This error has infected other of the Bank’s submissions. For example, the Bank \nsubmitted that “ It is most likely that PBC acted on the first defendant's instructions in relation to \nthis transfer [of Songo’s 24.79% stake in PBC to Agroprom in Feb 14]  or, if PBC didn't \nact on his instructions, it was because Songo, PBC and Agroprom were all D1/D2 companies and this was simply more shuffling of the deck.” {Day14/160:18- 22}. There is nothing to bring \nMr Bogolyubov into the equation. Songo (and its 24.79% share in PBC) was wholly \nowned by D1.  \n550. More importantly, there is no evidence of Mr Bogolyubov  controlling  PBC, in relation \nto the ‘ Scheme ’ or at all. There is evidence of PBC administering the ‘Scheme’, but no \nmention of Mr Bogolyubov. To attempt to bridge this gap, the Bank focuses on the existence of “ PBC nominees ” in Mr Bogolyubov ’s asset structures, his links to Mr \nMelnyk and other PBC individuals and the provision by PBC of services to him . \n550.1  As stated above, Mr Bogolyubov accepts that Primecap was involved in \nstructuring his asset holdings. These holdings were structured with the \nassistance of relevant tax and legal advisors, PBC and other CSPs. The fact that \nindividuals said to be employed by PBC ( e.g. Mr Melnyk) had roles in these \nstructures is consistent with this, as is the fact that PBC and Primecap employees appear to have worked together {Day14/138:12} -139:15. The fact \nof the involvement of these individuals was not hidden by Mr Bogolyubov as the Bank suggests (Bank Closing/111(4) {AA2/15/76} ) but was proactively \nincluded in his asset disclosure.  \n550.2  The Bank claims that Mr Bogolyubov  controlled PBC “ via instructions rendered to \nMelnyk ” {Day5/69: 19-21}. Yet there is no evidence of him giving any \ninstructions to Mr Melnyk or having any contact at all  with Mr Melnyk over \nthe Relevant Period. There were no emails between Mr Bogolyubov  and Mr \nMelnyk (or anyone else at PBC) in the data collected over the Relevant Period \n{AA6/20} and no WhatsApps with Mr Melnyk collected from Mr \nBogolyubov ’s devices in the period from Jul 17 for which data was available112 \n{A4/32/9} . The only piece of evidence which suggests a potential contact \n \n112  All available WhatsApp messages have been included in the trial bundle (Bundle K5 -A2).  \nAA4/6/176\n173 \n between Mr Bogolyubov  and Mr Melnyk is a WhatsApp message with Mr \nNovikov in 2021 where Mr Bogolyubov asks “ Is there someone I can speak with \nabout the Odesa issue? ” and Mr Novikov replies “ Available – 0163 Sergey Melnik ” \n{K5-A2/15/82} . Similarly, the Bank relies upon Mr Melnyk having a number \non the Black {Day14/144:4} ; however, Mr Melnyk only appears in the second \nBlack directory {K5-E/3.1/9}  which the Bank dates as from 2017 \n{Day13/71:8} and not the earlier directory from 2013 {K5 -E/2.1}.  \n550.3  There is  in fact  no evidence of Mr Bogolyubov  giving instructions to PBC at \nall. The Bank relies upon “ reporting from Novikov on the activities of PBC companies ” \nto say that there is a “ chain of command ” from Mr Novikov to Mr Bogolyubov to \nPBC {Day5/70:16} -71:14 , relying  upon Mr Novikov’s emails to Mr \nBogolyubov about Land M {E1/273} {E2/170.01}  and other projects \n{E1/254.1}  {E1/83.1} . In these emails, Mr Novikov refers to “ PBC companies ” \nin reporting to Mr Bogolyubov  about his assets. The emails do not show Mr \nBogolyubov giving any instructions to PBC. At most, he gives instructions to \nMr Novikov about his underlying assets. The emails have no bearing on the \nmanagement or control of PBC itself.  \n"}

In fact, the documents show  that ‘Scheme’  instructions often flow ed directly from \nBank employees to PBC. The chain of instructions from BOK to PBC is something \nthe Bank itself points out in relation to Uniks: see  Section E  below. Mr Bogolyubov \ndoes not appear in, and is not mentioned in, this chain.  \n552. The Bank  has a new fixation on payments made in 2018- 2019 by Grizal to Sunaltezza \nand on to alleged  PBC employees113 {AA2/14/7} . It has been explained in \ncorrespondence that Mr Bogolyubov was told it would help to facilitate the granting \n \n113  The Bank claims this shows it was a “ brazen lie ” that Mr Bogolyubov said he was not acquainted with \nany of the PBC individuals identified at {A1/7.1} save for Mr Melnik: Bank Closing/54(6) \n{AA2/15/40}. The mere fact that payments were made to a handful of individuals who had technical \nemployment contracts with a company linked to Mr Bogolyubov does not show that Mr Bogolyubov was acquainted with them. Nothing in the Grizal/Sunaltezza disclosure exercis e suggests that he did \nand the suggestion that a businessman like Mr Bogolyubov would be acquainted even with all true \nemployees of every company in his structures would be bizarre.  \nAA4/6/177\n174 \n of visas to certain individuals intending to relocate to Cyprus if those individuals were \nemployed by a company which had a trading history of more than two years in Cyprus.

However, Mr Marangos held shares in Primecap for Mr Kolomoisky, not Mr Bogolyubov {A2/31.1/3} . The \nBank also relies upon Mr Anischenko’s communications with Mr Marangos, addressed \nat ¶492 above.  \nE. WORKED EXAMPLE – UNIKS  \n554.

Yet Uniks  exemplifies the \nnumerous ways in which the Bank’s case against  Mr Bogolyubov’s  fails.

In particular , \nit illustrates that the Bank’s inferential case that Mr Bogolyubov  must have been party \nto decisions made to use Uniks  in the ‘ Scheme ’, based on his connections to D1, the \nBank and PBC , is falsified by the evidence of what actually happened.   \n \n114  T he Bank sought to make much of Mr Bogolyubov having attended Mr Marangos’ wedding in “ August \n2022” with Mr Novikov despite the fact there was a “ huge fraud ” {Day5/90:7} -91:2. The Bank once \nagain gets the facts wrong – the wedding was in fact in Sep 18 as the Bank’s own evidence says: Lewis \n24/65 {H1/68/20} \nAA4/6/178\n175 \n 555. Uniks is a company which held real assets in which Mr Bogolyubov was interested. \nYet, while there are some communications with him about these assets there are no \ncommunications with him about Uniks’ participation in the ‘Scheme’ ( Section E1 ). In \nfact, Relevant Loans were issued after Uniks  lost its interest in its real assets and there \nis no evidence Mr Bogolyubov was informed of this ( Section E2 ). The Uniks RDDs  \nwere simply used in the recycling scheme with no outflow from the Bank ( Section \nE3) and some were repaid with Intermediary Drawdowns within the recycling scheme \n(Section E4 ). Mr Bogolyubov’s interest in Uniks was  not “ hidden ” and Uniks was \nincluded in some of the Bank’s related party lists ( Section E5 ). Ultimately, there is no \nevidence at all of a misappropriation by Mr Bogolyubov through Uniks ( Section E 6). \n556. An updated agreed Uniks chronology has been produced which summarises relevant \ndocuments in the trial bundle { AA1/10 }. They provide a coherent account of how and \nwhy Uniks was used in the ‘ Scheme ’. \nE1. MR BOGOLYUBOV ’S CONNECTION TO AND DEALINGS WITH UNIKS  \n557. Mr Bogolyubov  accepts he had a 50% indirect interest in Uniks throughout the \nrelevant period  {A2/33/23- 24}. This was admitted in his original Defence of  17.1.20  \n{A1/19/3 }. \n558. As the Uniks Chronology shows, there are only a small handful of documents showing Mr Bogolyubov ’s involvement with Uniks . \n559. The first set of documents concern corporate ownership structures: \n559.1  A “Property Report ” spreadsheet created by Mr Anischenko  in 2007 mentions \nUniks  under the heading “ Real Estate in Ukraine ” {E1/11P/6} (line 213). This \nis consistent with Mr Bogolyubov ’s admitted interest in Uniks, has no relevance \nto the  ‘Scheme’  and dates from  before  the relevant time.  \n559.2  Uniks is also mentioned in a  Primecap  record from 201 1 {E1/56.1P}  (pp.4 and \n9). This does not mention Mr Bogolyubov , only recording Fenwick and \nFounttaro’s interests , 50% of the shares in w hich were held on trust for Mr \nBogolyubov {A2/33/23 -24}. This is again consistent with Mr Bogolyubov ’s \nadmitted interest in Uniks and acceptance that Primecap provides services to \nAA4/6/179\n176 \n him in relation to his business projects .115 It pre -dates the Uniks Relevant Loans \nand dates from the period in which Uniks was involved  with Land M .  \n559.3  There are various other documents noted in the Uniks Chronology concerning \nthe structure of Fenwick and Founttaro’s  shareholding in Uniks.  \n560. The second set of documents  (comprising three email chains)  concerns the \nmanagement of the Land M project . These are the only communications about Uniks \nto which Mr Bogolyubov  is party and they do not go past 28.10.13 (p.3, Uniks \nChronology)116 nearly a year prior to Uniks’ entry into the Relevant Loan : \n560.1  An email of 4.3.11 subject “ Budgets 2011 Privatland Land-M program ” was \nforwarded by Mr Novikov to Mr Bogolyubov , who sent a blank reply.117 The \nemail attached budgets for various ongoing projects, one of which was the \n“Land -M” project in Kha"}

These are the only communications about Uniks \nto which Mr Bogolyubov  is party and they do not go past 28.10.13 (p.3, Uniks \nChronology)116 nearly a year prior to Uniks’ entry into the Relevant Loan : \n560.1  An email of 4.3.11 subject “ Budgets 2011 Privatland Land-M program ” was \nforwarded by Mr Novikov to Mr Bogolyubov , who sent a blank reply.117 The \nemail attached budgets for various ongoing projects, one of which was the \n“Land -M” project in Kharkov {E1/83.1} {E1/83.2} {E1/83.3} . The Bank \nclaims this email gives a “ glimpse behind the curtain ” showing “ the chain of command \nby which these companies are in fact controlled ” {Day1/ 67:7-13}. However, the key \npoint which the Bank also acknowledged was that it shows that Uniks and other \ncompanies (including Dorteks) “ were at this stage engaged in a real project in Kharkov \nto do with land”. The email chain shows , at most, Mr Bogolyubov  giving his silent \napproval to Mr Novikov in relation to the budget for a rea l land project in \nwhich he was involved.   \n560.2  An email of  12.3.13 in which Mr Novikov informed  Mr Bogolyubov  of the \ncondition of the land plots in Kharkov, explaining that “ In 2005 5 PBC companies \nentered into the lease agreements for land plots in Kharkiv… Yuniks… Yulait … \nDorteks… Derling… Floreks… ” The leases had now expired, Kharkov City \nCouncil had refused to extend them and had “ filed a claim against the company \nparticipating in the project Derling LLC to terminate the land plot lease agreement ”. Mr \nBogolyubov  replies “ we won’t fight ” {E1/273} . The Bank says this is significant \n \n115  The fact that Primecap had such a record is therefore not significant , as the Bank sought to suggest \n{Day1/61:11 } -62:22 . \n116  There is only one communication in the Uniks Chronology (save for related party lists) after this point \nto which Mr Bogolyubov is party, a 2.9.16 email from Mr Distergov to Mr Bogolyubov about Hotel \nSplit {E15/132.1}. Uniks is not mentioned in this email.  \n117  The Bank initially suggested the content of this message was deleted {Day1/65 :12} -66:21 , but then  \nbacktracked and suggested the blank message shows  Mr Bogolyubov approving the budget  \n{Day3/16:11- 16}.  \n \nAA4/6/180\n177 \n in showing Mr Bogolyubov  giving indirect instructions through Mr Novikov \nto the directors of Uniks {Day1/69:1 8} -70:13. What it in fact shows is Mr \nBogolyubov giving instructions in relation to his Land M project, a real ongoing \nproject and an asset in which he was interested. Mr Novikov explains the \nexistence of the “ 5 PBC companies ” holding the asset and notably refers to them, \nnot as “ your companies ” but as “ PBC companies ”. \n560.3  An email of 28.10.13 in which Mr Novikov explained to  Mr Bogolyubov  that \n“5 companies of the PBC signed land lease agreements in the city of Kharkov ” and that \nKharkov City Council had refused extensions and filed lawsuits for the return \nof the land, which four of the companies had so far lost. He ask ed Mr \nBogolyubov to decide whether to return the land {E2/170.01} . He attache d a \nletter to Uniks from a third party about the court decision {E2/170.02} . No \nresponse from Mr Bogolyubov  has been identified. The B ank claims this also \nshows the “ chain of command ” {Day1/71: 12-13}; however, the correct analysis is \nthe same as that for the 12.3.13 email. The “ 5 PBC companies ” are not even \nnamed in the body of this  email.  \n561. The third set of documents are the related party lists, dealt with separately below.  \n562. There are no communications about Uniks to which Mr Bogolyubov  is party after its  \nassets are lost and the Kharkov land project falls apart. As the Bank itself recognises, after the 28.10.13 email “ Uniks’ role in this legitimate project came to an end and it became \nassetless, because its asset was a lease of land in Kharkov and it lost that ” {Day1/71: 18-21}, it is \n“assetless and has no stream of revenue following "}

Yet, as the Uniks Chronology shows, there are many \ncommunications about its role  in the ‘Scheme’  between other individuals, notably Bank \nemployees and Mr Barsuk.  \nE2. THE UNIKS RELEVANT LOANS  AND RDD S \n563. The Uniks Relevant Loan was entered into on 29.7.14 and the Uniks Intermediary Loan on 6.8.14. The RDDs  were made on 31.7.14 and 1.8.14. By this time, Uniks had \nlost its interest in the Kharkov land project and with this the reason for Mr Bogolyubov  \nbeing interested in Uniks. As the Bank put it “ the year after Uniks ’ project fails and its lease \nis forfeited, it is recycled and used as a vehicle for these two loans and the associated drawdowns .” \n{Day1/73: 1-4} \nAA4/6/181\n178 \n 564. Consistently with this, t he Bank employees dealing  with the issuance of the Uniks \nRelevant Loan did not mention Mr Bogolyubov  having an interest in the company. \nSimilarly, they did not appear to know that Uniks had been interested in real estate \nprojects (Land M), instead assigning it the same industry  - “general wholesale trade ” - as \nReal-Standart, which it replaced {K6/42.4.1}  {K6/34/2- 3} {K6/43.2.1} . Again as th e \nBank itself said “these BOK employees internally seem to regard Real and Uniks as fungible ” \n{Day1/85:1 -3} and that “ according to Barsuk, BOK and PBC are going to collectively decide \nwhat industry sector label to give to D1 and D2’s company Uniks ”. This treatment as fungible \ndoes not suggest, as the Bank claims, that both Uniks and Real Standart must be owned \nand controlled by D1  and Mr Bogolyubov  {Day1/85: 7-11}. Rather, it appears that the \nBank employees are using Uniks as a fungible shell, as the Bank put it “ frolicking with \nthe first and second defendants’ companies ” {Day1/107:7- 10}.   \n565. The Bank’s suggestion that Mr Bogolyubov  must therefore have known that the \nBank’s employees were  “committing the most extraordinarily outrageous and blatant fraud on \nthe first and second defendants, using their own companies to take money from the Bank that the defendants were major shareholders in, on a completely fictional pretext, right under their noses ” \n{Day1/107:7- 24} does not follow , especially as the evidence suggests that Mr \nBogolyubov was not intimately involved with the companies that held asset s for him  \nor the people who administered them . It is also based on a false premise: there  was no \nnet extraction of money from the Bank  as shown  below, the Uniks RDDs  circling  back \nto repay Real -Standart and Forsa loans.  \n566. In stark contrast to the emails about Land M , there is no evidence Mr Bogolyubov  was \ntold about the Uniks Relevant Loans and the Skype chats show Bank employees \ninstigating the process for issuing the Uniks Relevant Loan {K6/43.4/2- 7} {E4/177} . \nAs the Bank says  {Day1/77: 9-19}:  \nThis is not a client applying for a loan but a loan applying for a client.

It does not require the inference suggested by the Bank that the instructions must have come  from Mr Novikov acting on the \ninstructions of Mr Bogolyubov  {Day1/78:20}  -79:10 . Such an inference cannot be \ndrawn from the Land M emails which concerned a completely separate topic and time period, and would not fit with the Skype chats  which make no mention of Mr \nAA4/6/182\n179 \n Bogolyubov or even Mr Novikov e.g. {K6/43.4/2- 7}. Ultimately, t he Uniks Relevant \nLoan is signed off by Mr Dubilet alongside  other loan agreements , consistent with it \nbeing part of the broader recycling scheme  {E4/189} .  \n568. The Uniks RDDs  are also  instigated by Bank employees:  \n568.1  Drawdown 1 { K6/41/15 }: Ms Travkina states “ Kostya. Today we need to make the \nfirst UNIX dollar movement. Please send a request for $1,000. As per Contract No. \n4Yu14262D dated 29.07.14 ”. As the Bank says {Day1/133: 14-19} “this is BOK \ntelling PBC that it needs to issue a drawdown request .” \n568.2  Drawdown 2 { K6/41/15 -16}. Ms Travkina states “ Kostya. We’re giving \n$36,799,000.00 under agreement No. 4Y14262D dated 29.07.14”.  As the Bank says \n{Day1/134: 1-5} “that's again BOK saying, \"We are sending the money\"; and PBC, the \nentity that purports to own and direct the client --  direct the client in this case -- is saying, \n\"Okay, here's the request for the payment you want to make\", which is the wrong way \naround .” \n569. The Uniks paperwork was for the most part put in place later on (see Uniks Chronology, 29.4.15 { AA1/10/27 }). This is consistent with the recycling scheme.  \nE3. T\nHE INTENDED AND ACTUAL USE OF THE UNIKS RDD S \n570. The contemporaneous documents  and transactional data  show that the Uniks RDDs  \nwere not pilfered from the Bank but were intended to be, and actually were, used for \nloan recycling .  \n(1) Contempora neous  documents  \n571. Skype  message s show that the intention was to replace loans to Forsa and Real Standart \nwith a loan to Uniks. These  were skipped over by the Bank when it went  through t he \nUniks chronology in oral o pening . In summary:  \n571.1  Shortly before the Uniks Relevant Loan, on 16.7.14, Bank employees and Mr \nBarsuk discussed the possibility of repaying Forsa’s indebtedness e.g.  \n{K6/41.3/10- 12} \n571.2  In discussing the issuance of the Uniks Relevant Loan on 29.7.14, Ms \nDrozdova and Mr Martynyuk stated that Uniks was “ instead of Real -Standart \nLLC ” {K6/34/2}  \nAA4/6/183\n180 \n 571.3  On 31.7.18, Ms Travkina noted that “ ribotto 15, forsa  17.605 and real 19.195 –  \nwe’re selling all of it ”, to which Ms Gubanova replied “ they are also buying to repay \ndollar loans ” {K6/42.5/11 -12} \n571.4  On 1.8.14, Ms Travkina told Mr Barsuk “ We’re giving $36,799,000.00 under \nagreement No. 4Y14262D dated 29.07.14”  (the Uniks Relevant Drawdown). Mr \nBarsuk asked “ whose is Ribotto LLC, Forsa and Real -Standart …?” and said he \nwould “ write – Decide what to do with Returns ”. Mr Barsuk and Ms Drozdova \ndiscussed the repayment of USD 17.5m on the Forsa loan {K6/41.3/12- 13} \n571.5  On 1.8.14, Mr Kazantsev emailed Ms Gurieva setting out details of the Uniks \nRelevant Drawdown of USD 36.8m saying it was a “ Tech. disbursement. The same \nsum will be repaid on another client .” {E4/206.1}  \n571.6  Later that day, Mr Martynyuk told Mr Plyska that Uniks was “ taking the place of \nReal-Standart LLC ” {K6/42}  \n571.7  In a Skype message to Ms Gubanova of 22.8.14, Ms Nakonechnaya stated “Builders for projects….(3) Euroarena – Real Standart LLC (closing), Forsa LLC \n(closing), Empire, Yuniks (new)” {K6/26}  \n572.

As the Bank put it , “these BOK employees internally seem to regard Real and Uniks as fungible. \nSo Real was going to end whatever sham arrangements it was doing and Uniks -- start to end them, \nand Uniks was going to enter new sham agreements.  That seems to be what they're sayi ng.” \n{Day1/85:1 -7}. Yet t he Bank did not attempt to explain the inconsistency between \nthese  Skypes and the Bank’s case that the Uniks Relevant Drawdown funded an \n‘Unreturned’ Prepayment.  \n(2) Transactional data   \n573. An analysis of the  transactional data  using Exact Matching  fits perfectly with the \ncontemporaneous documents, showing the Uniks RDDs  going to Teamtrend before \nbeing used to make repayments of Real Standart and Forsa loans {D2/9/608- 611}. \nThese transactions were only hours apart:  \n31.7.14  \n17:00  First Uniks Relevant Drawdown of USD 1k {D2/9/619}  \n1.8.14  \n12:12  Second Uniks Relevant Drawdown of USD36.799m {D2/9/619}  \nAA4/6/184\n181 \n 14:02  Uniks transferred USD 36.8m to Teamtrend {D2/9/619}  \n14:35  Teamtrend received the USD 36.8m {D2/9/618}  \n14:54  Teamtrend made two transfers: USD 19.195m to Real Standart and USD \n17.605m to Forsa {D2/9/617}  \n15:09-15:40  Forsa received the funds from Teamtrend (15:09), converted them into UAH (15:26) and converted them back into USD (15:36), before making \nthe repayments on its loans and interest a few minutes later (15:39 and \n15:40) {D2/9/609- 611} \n15:09-15:38  Real received the funds from Teamtrend (15:09), converted them into UAH (15:24) and converted them back into USD (15:36), before making the repayments on its loans and interest a few minutes later (15:37 and \n15:38) {D2/9/6 09-611} \n574. The Bank’s case  that the Uniks RDDs  were not returned but were ‘extracted’ as an \n‘Unreturned’ Prepayment {D1/177/2} , relies  on the fact that the payment by Uniks to \nTeamtrend contained reference to a prepayment made under the Uniks RSA . This is  \nan agreement it accepts was only executed a few days after  the payment (Uniks \nChronology, 24.7.14 {AA1/10/4} and 4.8.14 {AA1/10/12 }). It says the repayments \nmade by Forsa and Real Standart were funded by returns of earlier prepayments made \nby them to Teamtrend under different supply agreements {Da y1/134: 15} -135:18 \n{D1/62} . However, this simply begs the question of what funded those returns of \nprepayment. Exact Matching shows that this was Uniks’ payment to Teamtrend, made less than an hour earlier. It was not the Real Standart RDDs  as claimed on the Bank’s \nMethodology. In particular, USD23.8m of the USD44.8m Real Standart RDDs  have \nalso been traced using Exact Matching to repayments of other lending {D2/9/32 0} \n{D2/9/490} . There are contemporaneous documents supporting the Exact Matching \nanalysis for USD10m of this: {E3/24} {E3/25 P}.  \n(3) Record s in the Kazantsev  and Gurieva Spreadsheets  \n575. This analysis is in turn supported by the Kazantsev and Gurieva Spreadsheets.  \n576. Uniks’ replacement of Real and Forsa in the recycling scheme  can be seen in the  \nKazantsev Spreadsheet  by comparing 29.7.14 and 1.8.14.  \n576.1  On 29.7.14, line 27 records a payment by Forsa to Teamtrend of USD 53.045m on 6.6.14, with 85 days expiring on 30.8.14.

The sums for Forsa (line 27) and Real Standart (line \n36) have reduced by a total of the same amount (by USD 17.605m for Forsa \nand USD 19.195m for Real Standa rt) {E7/39P/14} .  \n577. The same is true of the  Gurieva Spreadsheet {E18/213P }. As explained above, Uniks \nis a Type 1 ‘Unreturned’ Prepayment, for which the spreadsheet shows how the \nprepayment funds went on to be used. Uniks is at lines 82- 83. It records  in the \n“prepayment ” section the ‘Unreturned’ Prepayment of USD 36.8m by Uniks to \nTeamtrend on 1.8.14 under the RSA . It then records in the  “refund of the said prepayment ” \nsection refunds by Teamtrend to Forsa of USD 17.605m and to Real-Standart of \n19.195m.  \n(4) Conclusion  \n578. The evidence clearly shows that Uniks was part of a recycling scheme and that the \nRDDs  were not ‘extracted’. Mr Thompson essentially accepted this in XX, agreeing \nthat the contemporaneous documents, Kazantsev and Gurieva Spreadsheets show that  \n“the whole purpose of the  [Uniks]  exercise was to get monies to Real and Forsa so that Real and \nForsa could repay their debts to PrivatBank ” {Day23/61:8- 19} and support the Exact \nMatching analysis, not the Bank’s Methodology {Day24/77:23} - 78:24.  \n579. The Bank claims that the two Uniks RDDs having been made on 31.7.14 and 1.8.14, \n“As at 2.8.14 D1 and D2 were liable to the Bank in tort in the sum of US$36,800,800 ”: Bank \nClosing/770(1) {AA2/15/390} . Yet, by 2.8.14, the  Bank already had those funds back, \nas shown at  ¶573 above. \nE4. REPAYMENT  \n580. It is common ground that USD9.6m of the Uniks RDDs  were directly ‘ repaid ’ by \nIntermediary Drawdowns, with the balance directly ‘ repaid ’ by New Loans. The \nUSD9.6m was ultimately ‘ repaid ’ by New Loans {AA6/4} . \n581. The Intermediary Drawdowns were issued by the same process as for the RDDs , as \nthe Bank itself acknowledges  {Day2/1:24} -2:1 {Day1/144: 1} -146:1 0, with the \ninitiative coming from Bank employees as expressed in Skype messages (e.g. “ purchase \nAA4/6/186\n183 \n for redemption of 3.5 million dollars Unix = 43 265 250.00 UAH ” {K6/42.1/18} ). They \nalso fall within the recycling scheme.  \n582. The Bank claims that  the repayment  is “shuffling of purported loans which in no way diminishes \nthe loss arising from the misappropriation of 36.8 million through the relevant drawdown on 1 \nAugust ” {Day1/148:6-9} . Its attempts to distinguish the  “extraction ” of the USD 36.8m \nfrom  “shuffling ” to hide the first misappropriation {Day1/148:20} -149:9 is to draw  a \ndistinction without a difference. As shown above (and as accepted by the Bank), the \nUniks RDDs  were also “ shuffling ”, where the Bank treated Uniks as a fungible entity \nwhich could replace Real Standart and Forsa.  \n583. It is also difficult to see how the Bank refuses to take such repayments into account as reducing its claim where it does take into account “ partial returns of prepayment ” such as \nthe payment made by Teamtrend to Forsa on 1.8.14. The attempt to say this is a \n“reversal ” of a prepayment rather than a repayment is unconvincing and, as between \nBorrower and Bank, irrelevant {Day1/137:22 } -138:10,  {Day2/62:18} - 63:9. \nE5. UNIKS AS A RELATED PARTY  \n584. The Bank also relies upon how Uniks was treated as a related party to suggest it was \nused for wrongdoing, saying that Uniks should always have been included in the Bank’s \nrelated party lists and the fact that it was not so included before 2015 shows that D1 and Mr Bogolyubov’s interests in it were being covered u"}

UNIKS AS A RELATED PARTY  \n584. The Bank also relies upon how Uniks was treated as a related party to suggest it was \nused for wrongdoing, saying that Uniks should always have been included in the Bank’s \nrelated party lists and the fact that it was not so included before 2015 shows that D1 and Mr Bogolyubov’s interests in it were being covered up.  \n585. The Bank has not explained by reference to the applicable rules on related parties on what basis it is said that Uniks should always have been included in the lists . In \nparticular, it has not shown that Mr Bogolyubov’s indirect interests would have been sufficient for inclusion and it has not  dealt with  the significant  fact that Uniks lost its \nreal assets in late 2013 . Nonetheless, even if one acts on the assumption that it should \nhave been included  in the lists , the picture painted by the evidence on the preparation \nof the lists is not one of cover-up, but of disorganisation and possible confusion as to the impact of the expansion of the related party rules in mid- 2015. \n586. The timeline of Uniks’ treatment  in the Bank’s related party lists is as follows : \n586.1  31.3.15/1.4.15: the Luchaninov Email {E8/165} suggests Uniks is a potential \nrelated party on the basis that it shared a director (Mr Dmytrenko) with Eksimnaftoproduct and Illichivsk Fuel Terminal. It is proposed that Mr \nDmytrenko is removed from either Uniks or the other companies. As set out \nAA4/6/187\n184 \n below, Mr Dmytrenko was removed as director from Eksimnaftoproduct and \nIllichivsk Fuel Terminal. The Bank says that the proposal was thereby implemented; however, it did not go to the next stage of the exercise, which is to look at what happened to the rel ated party lists.  \n586.2  22.4.15: Corporate records state that Mr Dmytrenko was removed from the \nSupervisory Board of Eksimnaftoproduct on this date {K3 -A7/57} . \n586.3  13.5.15 : Uniks  is included in the Bank’s annual IFRS list signed by D1 and Mr \nBogolyubov for y/e 2014 as a non- related party {E9/195.4/22 } \n{E9/195.3/1 }. As shown by {E1/229} , Mr Bogolyubov  was not involved in \nthe preparation of these lists but was given them to sign.  \n586.4  1.6.15 : Uniks is included in the Bank’s NBU list as a related party on the basis \nthat “The company in O.V. Dmitrenko was the director ” {K3-D/101P /1} (#53) . This \noccurred after the expansion of the definition of related party in Art.52. An EY report records that Uniks was independently identified as a related party by the Bank {E17/241/28} . The Bank has no good explanation for how this can be \nreconciled with its case of “cover -up”. It suggests Uniks was added “ when the \ncoast was clear or clearer ” or “ Perhaps  it was felt that it didn't matter as long as it was only \n2015 onwards and not the critical period of 2014.” {Day2/47:11} -48:2. This is wholly \nunconvincing. On the Bank’s own case, the “cover -up” of the \nmisappropriation continued well after the date Uniks was added to the list  and \nthe NBU’s investigations into the Bank were ongoing : see e.g. D2  \nOpening/Schedule 4, p.19ff {AA4/5/19}. Mr Luchaninov said  he could not \nremember the specifics of this and could not help on why Uniks was included in the list despite Mr Dmytrenko’s removal {Day9/94:18} - 95:11 . \n586.5  26.6.15: Corporate records state that Mr Dmytrenko was removed from the \nSupervisory Board of Illichivsk Fuel Terminal on this date {K3-A7/110} . \n586.6  1.7.15 : Uniks was added to the IFRS list as a related party, a “ Company under the \ncontrol of the Bank’s shareholders ” {K3-E/95P/25} . It remained on the list until \n1.10.16 {K3 -E/125P/17}  (the last list before Nationalisation).  \n586.7  1.11.15 : Uniks is removed from the NBU list  “Due to O.V.

The attached \nspreadsheet states that Uniks is  “abandoned ” {E13/51.02} . Notably, Uniks \nremained  in the IFRS list at this time  on the basis of control by D1 and Mr \nBogolyubov ( e.g., the list of 1.4.16 {K3 -E/109P/24} ), suggesting a disconnect \nbetween the Compliance department (in charge of the NBU lists) and the \nInvestment Business (in charge of the IFRS lists).  \nE6. A\n MISAPPROPRIATION BY MR BOGOLYUBOV  VIA UNIKS ? \n587. In conclusion, the above shows that there was no misappropriation by or via Uniks. The documents and transactional data show that the money flow ed back to the Bank \nwithin the space of hours. There was no theft from the Bank’s vault, but at most \nshuffling around of ledger entries. If the paperwork is all treated as sham and stripped away  (as Art . 235.2 Civil Code mandates and common sense requires), the funds flow \nis clearly circular. As Mr Beketov said : “What matters is whether  … [the overall amount \nof funds to which the Bank is entitled]  have unlawfully diminished ” (Beketov8/118 \n{C1/1/ 39}). The repayments by way of Intermediary Drawdown are also clearly a \ncontinuation of the same shuffling process. Mor eover, it is clear that, whatever was \ngoing on, Mr Bogolyubov was not involved in Uniks being used in this way. \nF. LEGAL CONSEQUENCES  \nF1. OVERVIEW  \n588. The comments made in Mr Bogolyubov’s written opening118 regarding the nature of \nthe Ukrainian legal system, the matters which the Bank must (but cannot) establish for its claim to succeed and the novelty of the Bank’s claims from a Ukrainian law \nperspective remain true and are repeated. Indeed, the Bank’s atte mpts to present its \n \n118  At D2 Opening/259– 263 {AA4/1/102 -104}. \nAA4/6/189\n186 \n claim as being entirely straightforward as a matter Ukrainian law have only served \nfurther to illustrate its inherent and fundamental flaws. \n589. In particular, the Bank ’s attempted recharacterisation of its claim as being no different \nfrom  a case of  ‘theft’ and the taking of physical money from a bank vault ,119 as well as \nits superficial  assertions that such conduct must obviously be unlawful under \nUkrainian civil law , have run aground as a result of the Bank’s own failure to establish \nthat there was any misappropriation of monies as a matter of fact.  That failure is fatal \nto any tortious claim under Art. 1166 , since there can be no claim in the absence of \nharm on the facts. \n590. Without prejudice to this overriding submission that the Bank has failed to prove harm  \n(or any associated loss)  on the facts,  certain of the Ukrainian law issues are addressed \nbelow . In order to avoid unnecessary duplication, Mr Bogolyubov will  adopt Mr \nKolomoisky’s submissions on the ‘Repayment’ and limitation defences , since these \nmatters apply equally to both defendants . 120 However,  the prior question of liability  in \nprinciple must be considered separately in relation to each Defendant.   \nF2.

THE BANK CANNOT DEMONSTRATE UNLAWFUL CONDUCT  BY MR \nBOGOLYUBOV  \n591. As explained in Mr Bogolyubov’s written opening,121 the Bank’s case is that the \nDefendants’ alleged conduct was unlawful as a matter of Ukrainian civil law as being contrary to the supposed General Principles and/or the Specific Duties. A s against Mr \nBogolyubov , that claim  must fail on the facts, since there is no evidence that he  knew \nof the ‘Scheme’ (that is the 27 0 acts of theft) or that he  committed any acts or deliberate \n \n119  Bank’s Oral Opening {Day2/60:17}  -61:4 and {Day2/81:24}  -82:6. \n120  The Repayment defence must obviously apply equally to all Defendants. There is also no basis on which \nthe claim could be time barred against D1 but not D2. In particular, the Bank’s own case is that anyone \nwho knew of the alleged ‘Scheme’ must have believed that both D1 and  D2 were behind it. It says that \nit is “inconceivable”  that the ‘Scheme’ could have been perpetrated otherwise than for the benefit of Mr \nKolomoisky and  Mr Bogolyubov (Bank’s Oral Opening {Day1/8:12 -17}) and that there was “no way”  \nthat it could have been carried out otherwise than at their instigation (Bank’s Oral Opening {Day 3/53:22} –54:18). This was indeed the inference drawn at the time. In particular, the Glavcom \narticle reported that the Borrowers “have many things in common with the Privat Group of the Dnipropetrovsk \nbusinessman”  and that the Defendant Suppliers were “old acquaintances of the Privat business group”  \n({E7/8/2},  {E7/8/7}) . As Ms Rozhkova confirmed, it is extremely well-known in Ukraine that ‘Privat’ \nand the ‘Privat Group’ are terms used to refer to businesses which are regarded as being owned by Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov {Day8/33:13- 21}. \n121  At ¶¶265 –266 {AA4/1/104 -105}. \nAA4/6/190\n187 \n omissions in connection with it which caused the Bank harm.

Article 3(1)(2) of the Civil Code: The Court should find  that this  is an interpretative \nguide to the Civil Code and not a substantive rule capable of giving rise to a \nfreestanding tortious claim, for the following reasons: \n592.1  Fi rst , this construction is most consistent with the title, wording and position \nof the article within the Civil Code, which all indicate that it sets outs broad \nand general principles which should be used as an aid to the interpretation of \nthe Code’s substanti ve provisions.122 This is further illustrated by the nature of \nthe other general principles identified in Art. 3, such as “freedom of contract”  and \n“justness, good faith and reasonableness ”. 123 Mr Beketov rightly accepted that the se \nprovisions are  “fairly generalised”  and “potentially very broad−ranging” .124 Such \ngeneralised and high- level principles  are self -evidently not apposite to serve as \nan independent basis for a claim. \n592.2  Second, the interpretive nature of Art. 3 is  strongly supported by  the fact that \nthere are no reported Ukrainian cases in which Art. 3(1)(2) has formed the standalone basis of a tortious claim.\n125 As Mr Beketov accepted, i t would be \n“surprising”126—indeed remarkable —for there to be no reported cases applying \nthis article if it could found a civil claim for compensation, not least since cases \nof the taking of another’s property cannot be uncommon in any country.

Given \nthe absence of court practice, Mr Beketov was forced to concede that his view that Art. 3(1)(2) could be relied upon was merely his “opinion on how Ukrainian law should develop”  and is unsupported by an academic or judicial writing .\n127 \n \n122  As explained by Mr Alyoshin, “Article 3 is titled ‘General Principles of Civil Legislation’ and is found very early in \nthe Civil Code, in Book One (entitled ‘General Provisions’), Section I (entitled ‘Basic Provisions’), Chapter 1 (entitled \n‘Civil Legislation of Ukraine’) : Alyoshin1/198– 199 {C2/1/73} . \n123  Art. 3 { C1/6/1}  \n124  {Day27/140:23} –141:6  \n125 Alyoshin1/202 {C2/1/74 } and accepted by Mr Beketov {Day27/140:14- 22} and {Day27/141:18} –\n142:1. \n126  {Day27/142:2- 11} \n127  {Day27/142:14} – 143:19 \nAA4/6/191\n188 \n 592.3  Third , the Bank’s reliance on judicial statements that the general principles set \nout in Art. 3 are “ norms of direct effect”  which must be taken into account “when \ninterpreting the norms contained in the acts of civil legislation”  supports, rather than \nundermines, the Defendants’ case . As Mr Alyoshin explained in XX, such \nstatements  and the relevant court practice  confirm the interpretative nature of \nthe principles set out in Art. 3.128 \n592.4  Fourth, this is the only construction of the article which is reconcilable with \nthe fact that under Ukrainian law misappropriation is exclusively dealt with by \nthe criminal law.129 If Art. 3(1)(2) could render  the taking of another’s property \nunlawful as a matter of civil law, then all cases of misappropriation would also \ngive rise to civil liability, contrary to the fundamental division between civil and criminal liability in Ukrainian law.  \n593. Articles 13(2) & (3) of the Civil Code: The Court should also reject the Bank’s case \nthat the Defendants’ alleged conduct was contrary to these articles ,130 which prohibit \na person from exercising rights in an abusive or intentionally harmful manner. The y \nare of no assistance to the Bank:  \n593.1  First, it is plain from the wording of  these articles that they have defensive \nrather than offensive effect.131 Their function is  to regulate the manner in which \na party may exercise legally recognised rights, for example by restraining a party from exercising a right where this is done with the intention of harming \nanother. There is nothing in the wording of the articles to indicate t hat they \ncould be capable of founding a tortious claim for damages and it is  common \nground between the Ukrainian law experts that there are no cases in which this \nhas occurred .\n132 Indeed, Mr Beketov conceded that he is not aware  of any  cases \nin which this  has even been argued.133 \n \n128  {Day29/151: 7} –154:11  \n129  This is the view of Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida: Ukr.Law-JM/39.2 {C5/1/18}. \n130 Stating: “(2) When exercising his rights, a person is obliged to refrain from actions that could violate other persons’ rights, \nor damage the environment or cultural heritage. (3) Actions committed with the intention of harming another person and \nabuses of rights in  other forms are not permitted .” {C2/8/2} . \n131 Alyoshin1/203 –211 {C2/1/74 -79} and {Day29/155: 6-21}; Nahnybida3/69 –74 {C4/1/12 }. \n132  Mr Beketov accepted that there are no such cases: {Day27/151:4- 10}. \n133  {Day27/153: 8-24}  \nAA4/6/192\n189 \n 593.2  Second, even on its own case the Bank cannot identify any legally recognised \nright (which it is common ground is required for Art. 13 to apply134) that Mr \nBogolyubov is alleged to have abused.

This deficiency would be fatal to its \nattempt to rely on Arts. 13(2) –(3) even if such articles could found a tortious \nclaim (which it is plain they cannot). The Bank’s Opening  made no serious \nattempt to identify the right which it claims that Mr Bogolyubov abused or \nexercised with the intention to injure the Bank .135 The Bank’s Closing now  \nasserts  that “D1-2 exercised their rights of ownership and control over the Borrowers, \nIntermediary Borrowers, D3 -8 and New Borrowers, and their rights as 90% shareholders \nand Supervisory Board members… for the illegitimate purpose of misappropriating the Bank’s funds”.\n136 This is hopeless ly vague and smacks of desperation. What \nspecific rights as shareholder or Supervisory Board member is Mr Bogolyubov \nsaid to have abused and how? How is any right of ownership or control (if the \nlatter could even be said to be a legally recognised right) said to have been \nabused? The Bank evidently has no answers.  \n594. As explained in Mr Bogolyubov’s written opening,137 there is nothing remarkable or \nsurprising (as the Bank asserts) in the conclusion that the conduct which the Bank alleges is not unlawful pursuant to the supposed General Principles. The Ukrainian legal system instead prohibits such conduct through the cr iminal law and provides \nmechanisms for victims to obtain compensation as part of the criminal process or via \na civil claim following a criminal conviction.\n138 While this differs from the English legal \nsystem, it is a perfectly rational approach which must be recognised and applied by this \nCourt in the same way that it would be applied by a Ukrainian court.139 \n(2) Alleged breach of the Specific Duties  \n595. The Bank’s case that Mr Bogolyubov breached the Specific Duties fares no better.  \n \n134 Ukr.Law -JM/33 {C5/1/16 }. \n135  See ¶463 of the Bank’s Written Opening, which was silent on this key matter {AA2/1/189}. \n136  ¶502(2) of the Bank’s Closing {AA2/15/282}. \n137  At ¶¶269 –271 {AA4/1/106 -107} \n138  As Mr Alyoshin explained, the Defendants’ alleged conduct might be unlawful under Ukrainian criminal \nlaw and the Bank could seek compensation from the Defendants following that unlawfulness being \nestablished by a criminal court: {Day29/118:2 -9}. \n139  National Bank Trust v Yurov  [2020] EWHC 100 (Comm)  at [936] {M1/22/299}  \nAA4/6/193\n190 \n 596. The Specific Duties are duties which Mr Bogolyubov owed to the Bank only by virtue \nof his position on the Bank’s Supervisory Board.140 The better view , as Mr Beketov \nwas driven to concede,  is that such duties apply only when a person exercises the \npowers or responsibilities  conferred on them by their office :141 \nQ.   That's precisely the point, and I think the way you've just put it, he can't use his office \nin a way which is in breach of his fiduciary duties; correct?  \nA.   Yes. \nQ.   And that's what one is looking for. The touchstone for a fiduciary duty is you're looking at conduct which is in the performance or non- performance of someone's official \nduties or somehow using his office improperly to further his own interests. That' s right, \nisn't it?  \nA.   Yes, maybe the conduct which is used in performance or non- performance of \nsomeone's official duties.  \n597. The Bank does not allege that Mr Bogolyubov exercised any powers conf erred on him \nby virtue of his role on the Bank’s Supervisory Board to further the alleged ‘Scheme’ . \nOn the contrary, it is common ground that the Relevant Loans were never submitted \nto the Bank’s Supervisory Board for approval .

Nor was there any  order  by Mr \nBogolyubov , or by the Supervisory Board,  directing the Bank’s employees to  undertake \nany of the transactions said to comprise the ‘Scheme’.  Accordingly,  even if there were \nany evidence that Mr Bogolyubov was involve d in the ‘Scheme’ (which there is not),  \nthe Bank could not point to any positive conduct by him  taken in breach of the Specific \nDuties . \n598. The Bank has also not advanced any  coherent claim that Mr Bogolyubov breached the \nSpecific Duties by omission.  Its case has been firmly put , both in the pleadings142 and \nits Opening,143 on the basis that Mr Bogolyubov took positive actions to procure the \nalleged ‘Misappropriation’. It has not articulated any proper  case that Mr Bogolyubov  \nomitted to exercise some  unidentified power held by virtue of his role on the \nSupervisory Board to prevent the ‘Scheme’  or established as a matter of fact that Mr \nBogolyubov knew of or had any ability in reality to prevent the specific  conduct.

The full exchange may be seen at {Day28/95:4}  –98:25.  \n142  While the Bank’s pleading makes a generic allegation that “the actions, decisions and omissions of Messrs \nKolomoisky and Bogolyubov were unlawful”  (RRRRAPOC/51 {A1/2/29}), no alleged omissions have been \nparticularised. The particulars given by the Bank are all allegations of positive conduct: see \nRRRRAPOC/52(1) {A1/2/29} and the Bank’s Amended Response to Mr Bogolyubov’s RFI dated \n24.03.2020 at ¶E to ¶G {A2/4/4 -5}. \n143  Bank’s Written Opening ¶461 {AA2/1/188 -189} and ¶¶464– 475 {AA2/1/189 -192}. \nAA4/6/194\n191 \n ensure that the Relevant Loans were put to the Supervisory Board for approval  goes \nnowhere since  it was not the absence of approval which, on the Bank’s case, caused it \nharm. On the contrary, its case is that loans could not  properly have been approved.144 \n599. Further, Mr Bogolyubov could not  have breached the Specific Duties by omission in \ncircumstances where he was unaware of the ‘Scheme’ . The Bank ’s questioning of Mr \nAlyoshin on this issue expressly assumed that the Defendants were “aware that \nmisappropriation is about to happen”  and his answers were given on this premise .145 The \nBank failed  (for good reason, since it would not represent Ukrainian  law146) to put any \ncase that the Specific Duties  could be breached where a Supervisory Board member \ndoes not take steps to prevent harmful conduct of which they are unaware. \n600. Accordingly (and whatever the position is regarding Mr Kolomoisky),  the claim that \nMr Bogolyubov breached the Specific Duties is not made out. The Bank cannot show \nthat he committed any unlawful conduct and its case against him must fail.  \nF3. THE BANK CANNOT ESTABLISH THAT IT SUFFERED THE LOSS CLAIMED  \n601. The Bank’s Closing seeks to draw an artificial distinction between the question whether \nthe Bank suffered harm, which it asserts is demonstrated merely by the fact that the \nRelevant Drawdowns were made (which it claims was a ‘Misappropriation’ despite there being no evidence of such funds leaving the Bank) and questions of the quantum \nof that harm, in relation to which it contends that it is the Defendants who bear the \nburden of proving that the Bank received ‘full compensation’ throug"}
{"start": 511000, "text": "\n601. The Bank’s Closing seeks to draw an artificial distinction between the question whether \nthe Bank suffered harm, which it asserts is demonstrated merely by the fact that the \nRelevant Drawdowns were made (which it claims was a ‘Misappropriation’ despite there being no evidence of such funds leaving the Bank) and questions of the quantum \nof that harm, in relation to which it contends that it is the Defendants who bear the \nburden of proving that the Bank received ‘full compensation’ through the Repayment \nor Use  of Funds defences. \n602. Ukrainian law imposes no such straightjacketed analysis. On the contrary, Mr Beketov’s evidence (ignored by the Bank ’s Closings ) is that harm is a question of fact \nwhich must be established by looking at the reality of what occurred (including the \nflow of funds)  and what the parties to a transaction truly intended, rather than being \nbound by any false labels they may have used.\n147 In Mr Beketov’s own words, when \nassessing “whether the Bank has suffered harm…[w]hat matters is whether the Defendants’ alleged \nacts have unlawfully diminished the overall amount  of funds to which the Bank is entitled.”  \n \n144  RRRAPOC/52(2) {A1/2/30}  \n145  {Day30/35:12} –37:11  \n146  See Mr Bogolyubov’s Written Opening at ¶278 {AA4/1/110} . \n147  See Beketov XX at {Day28/140:19}  –141:18  and {Day28/143:25} –145:1. \nAA4/6/195\n192 \n (emph.)148 Paragraph 417 of the Bank’s Closing seeks to rely on a supposed concession \nat Alyoshin1/172 {C2/1/62}  that harm is caused when a claimant is deprived of their \nproperty, but fails to mention Mr Alyoshin’s view in the same passage that “damages \ncan only be awarded to compensate the claimant for its actual loss: no damages will be awarded in \nrespect of harm which has already been remedied by the time the court gives its judgment.”  For the \nBank to prove that it suffered harm, it must be able to show an actual loss on the true \nfacts, rather than on some blinkered analysis which ignores the reality of w hat \noccurred. \n603. As explained in Section B  above, the Bank has wholly failed to prove an actual loss. \nIt has not established that the RDDs were extracted from the Bank or that they caused an overall diminution in the Bank’s funds. On the contrary, so far as the destination \nof the RDDs can be traced, they were almost entirely returned to the Bank as part of \nthe loan recycling. In so far as the destination of RRDs cannot be traced, the Bank has \nfailed to discharge its burden of establishing an inference that they were \nmisappr opriated. The inference which in fact arises from the matters considered in \nSection C  above is that these funds must also have been recycled back to the Bank. \nThe Bank framed its claim by reference to a ‘Misappropriation’ in which vast sums were supposedly siphoned out or “extracted” from the Bank through the RDDs and URPPs for the benefit of D1 and D2, but it has singularly failed to prove this. \n604. The Bank’s claim that it has suffered harm for the purposes of Art. 1166 therefore lies \nin tatters. It has eschewed any other basis for claiming that the RDDs caused it loss, \nin particular denying that it advances any claim on the basis that these loans we re \nimpaired or not repaid {Day2/61:10} –62:6. Further, its questioning of the Ukrainian law experts in relation to harm was premised on the assumption that funds were \nmisappropriated (see {Day31/108:25}  ff). \n605. The Bank’s claim therefore falls at this hurdle, before any consideration need be given \nto the ‘Repayment’ or ‘Use of Funds’ defences. Such defences are only of relevance if the Bank has first established a prima facie  loss on the facts, but it has failed to do so \nand the Defendants therefore do not bear any burden of establishing a countervailing defence.  \n \n148  Beketov8/118 {C1/1/39}. \nAA4/6/196\n193 \n 606.

Without prejudice to this position, Mr Bogolyubov adopts the submissions made on \nbehalf of Mr Kolomoisky concerning the ‘Repayment’ defence. Those submissions persuasively demonstrate why, even if the Bank could demonstrate a prima facie  loss, its \nclaim would still fail because the Bank has chosen (for jurisdictional and other reasons) \nto sue in relation to the wrong transactions. The following points are made by way of \namplification.  \n607. First, the Bank’s claim that the reasoning in National Bank Trust v Yurov  is inapplicable \nto its case because the claim in Yurov was for loss caused by impaired loans rather than \nmisappropriation is a false characterisation.149 The Bank relies as the supposedly crucial \ndistinction with its case on the fact that the claim in Yurov was formulated by reference \nto the outstanding debt of the relevant borrowers under the loans in question.150 \nHowever, the Bank’s pleading is in fact formulated in the very same way:  \n607.1  The Bank’s pleaded case is and remains that its loss was suffered as a result of the Borrowers failing ‘validly’ to repay the RDDs, leaving outstanding sums due: \nBank’s Amended Response to the Second Defendant's Request for Further \nInformation dated 24 March 2020/21(d) {A2/4/22}:  \nThe Bank suffered a loss as a result of the Misappropriation, which began \nwith the transfer of funds from the Bank to the Borrowers under the Relevant Loans. The Borrowers failed validly to repay all or part of the Relevant \nDrawdowns , leaving an outstanding sum of approximately US$1.9 billion.  \n607.2  One of the two ways in which the Bank quantifies its purported loss is by \nreference to the alleged outstanding balance of the RDDs : \nBank’s Amended Response to the Second Defendant's Request for Further \nInformation dated 24 March 2020/21(a) {A2/4/22} : \nThe sum of US$1,911,877,385 referred to in RAPOC and the US$1.9 \nbillion referred to in the Reply represent:  \ni. The Bank’s quantification of the minimum figure for the total principal outstanding in respect of the Relevant Drawdowns  (taking into account \nthe extent to which, based on information currently available to it, the Bank accepts that the Relevant Drawdowns  have been validly repaid); \nand/or \nii. The total amount of the Unreturned Prepayments (which on the \nBank’s case were caused by the Relevant Drawdowns ). \n \n149  Equally spurious is the Bank’s new suggestion that Yurov  was about “a valid previous loan” (Bank’s \nClosing/783(4) {AA2/15/401}. Mr Beketov agreed repeatedly in XX that whether or not the first loan \nwas valid, if the Bank accepted sums in repayment of the loan that would discharge the borrower’s \nliability to repay the funds (whether that liability arose in contract or restitution) . See particularly \n{Day28/38:22} –41:25. \n150  {Day2/97:3} –99:12  \nAA4/6/197\n194 \n 607.3  Further, in assessing its purported loss the Bank gives credit for what it says \nare ‘valid’ repayments of the Relevant Loans, which would be irrelevant if its loss is entirely separate from the outstanding loan balances: \nRe-Re-Re-Amended Reply/35.2 {A1/25/66} : \nAs a matter of Ukrainian law, the Bank as the victim of a fraudulent \nmisappropriation suffers a loss for the purposes of Article 1166 or otherwise in the amount of the sums drawn down under the Relevant \nLoans which have not been validly repaid to the Bank. .. \n608. The Bank’s pleaded case therefore remains premised on its loss being dependent on \nthe outstanding balance  of the Relevant Loans. Only when opening its case at trial did \nthe Bank seek to deny that its loss falls to be assessed by reference to the extent of the \n‘valid’ r"}
{"start": 518000, "text": " the victim of a fraudulent \nmisappropriation suffers a loss for the purposes of Article 1166 or otherwise in the amount of the sums drawn down under the Relevant \nLoans which have not been validly repaid to the Bank. .. \n608.

Only when opening its case at trial did \nthe Bank seek to deny that its loss falls to be assessed by reference to the extent of the \n‘valid’ repayment of the Relevant Loans, contending that it instead claims for the loss \ncaused by the supposed misappropriation of the RDDs and (rather tortuously) that \nthe Relevant Loans merely “covered [the] loss” .151 \n609. Second, whether or not the Bank is held to its pleaded case, where monies are extracted \nfrom a bank under the guise of lending, the bank’s loss cannot be separated from the question whether the loan in question has been repaid (or, if the loan agreement is \nvoid, whether the recipient has given restitution of any benefits received\n152). If a \nfraudster misappropriates money from a bank purportedly pursuant to a loan \nagreement but a third party discharges the fraudster’s debt to the bank, the bank will not have suffered any loss even though, in a proprietary sense, the misappropriated \nmoney is not returned. The same applies if the bank is able to make a recovery by \nenforcing the loan. It makes no difference whether the bank frames its claim as one \nfor the loss suffered by reason of entering into the loan agreement or by reason of transferring money to the fraudster. On either basis, the relevant question is whether \nthe bank has suffered a net financial loss. If monies equal to the amount \nmisappropriated from the bank are returned to it, the bank cannot be said to have suffered any loss of principal. This is correct both as a matter of obviousness and Ukrainian law, as Mr Beketov was forced to accept {Day28/24:13- 25}: \nQ. …So insofar as you haven't suffered a loss of profit and you haven't incurred expenses \n-- okay?  Let's leave that on one side for the moment --  your only loss is that I took a \nmillion from you and now you have a million back.  In that situation, there w ould be -\n- the liability in restitution has been discharged and the claim in tort against Mr Hunter \n \n151  {Day2/76:23} – 78:13. \n152  The Ukrainian law experts agree that where money is transferred pursuant to a void or voidable \nagreement, the consequence is that the recipient(s) must give restitution: Ukr.Law -JM /5.7 {C5/1/5} \nAA4/6/198\n195 \n who procured this would also be extinguished because you would have no further loss \nthat you could claim against Mr Hunter; correct?  \nA.   The claim would not be extinguished but the loss under the claim may be \nextinguished.  \nQ.  Not \"may be\", \"would be\"?  \nA.   Would be.  \n610. Of course, if in the example just given, it is the fraudster who themselves repays the \nloan using the proceeds of a further fraudulently obtained loan from the bank which \nis never repaid, then the bank will have suffered a net loss. But that loss is caused  by \nthe drawing and non- repayment of the second loan, not the first loan: that is the key \nto the ratio of Yurov,153 which the Ukrainian law experts agree is consistent with \nUkrainian law, and is obviously correct as a matter of logic and principle. Any claim brought only in respect of the loss supposedly caused by the first loan/drawdown would fail, since the repayment  (or, if the loan agreement is void, restitution of the \nfraudster’s unjust enrichment) extinguishes any loss suffered by the bank as a result of \nthe first loan/drawdown. Again, Mr Beketov was driven to accept this {Day28/44:20} \n–45:23:\n154 \nQ.

It is not disputed that the Bank in fact accepted repayments in respect of the Relevant \nLoans/Drawdowns and recorded those loans as discharged, and any liability of the \n \n153  At [1193] –[1194] {M1/22/370} , addressed in Mr Bogolyubov’s written opening at ¶¶288 –291 \n{AA4/1/113 -115} \n154  The exchanges leading to this conclusion may be found at {Day 28/38:22 } –44:19. \n155  Meaning the loss of principal as opposed to any consequential loss of profit or expenses incurred to \nrecover the principal loss (which are not claimed by the Bank). See: {Day28/23:24}  –24:5.  \nAA4/6/199\n196 \n Borrowers in respect of these matters extinguished, in its transactional data. That \nremains the case to this date. The Bank’s claim is based on a category 1 loss. The Bank has not sought any form of declaration or judgment in Ukraine (or indeed elsewhere) on the basis that the Borrowers have any outstanding liability (whether in contract or \nrestitution) in respect of the Relevant Loans. \n612. Further and consistently, no loss has been recorded in the Bank’s accounts in respect \nof the Relevant Loans.\n156 Instead, the Bank has recognised (and continues to recognise) \nan impairment only in respect of the New Loans.157 The Bank’s own accounts are \ntherefore entirely consistent with the foregoing analysis and record the Bank’s own view, approved by its post -nationalisation management, that the cause of its loss was \nthe impairment of the New Loans by reason of their non- recoverability and, it \nnecessarily follows, that the Relevant Loans were not the cause of its loss.\n158 \n613. While the Bank sought to undo some of the damage done to its case in its re -\nexamination of Mr Beketov on the false basis that Mr Beketov was confused as to the premise of some of the questioning, such re -examination (particularly where it \namounted to littl e more than asking the witness to confirm that they had not moved \nfrom their written evidence despite having given materially inconsistent answers in XX) is of no persuasive value. Further, even in re -examination it appears that Mr \nBeketov would have answe red, had he not been cut -off by the Bank’s counsel, that \nrepayment of a void loan using the proceeds of a subsequent void loan would \nextinguish any ‘Category 1’ (i.e. principal) loss in"}

Can you explain, in your view, whether at the end of stage 2 the bank officer is still \nliable in tort 1 and tort 2 or whether you think that his liability has changed?  \nA.   Mr Hunter, I believe liability in tort is liability in loss, as I said to Mr Howard, so I consider there are three counts of loss under Article 22.  It is said that it is not losses, it is actually things which a person was deprived of, the second thi ng \nis expense and the third thing is lost profit.  So on that basis, I believe that \nrepayment of -- to borrower 1 does not fully  extinguish loss under tort in any \nevent.

CAUSATION AND ARTICLE 1190 \n614. While the principles of causation and joint and several liability under Art. 1190 of the \nCivil Code have generated a significant volume of expert evidence, the real issues of \nrelevance are now comparatively limited  since it is common ground that Art. 1190 \ndoes not create a freestanding head of liability: Ukr.Law -JM/56.1 {C5/1/24} . \n(1) Procurement  and the requirement of direct causation \n615. Mr Beketov agreed  that a person who procures another to commit an unlawful act \nwhich causes harm will not be liable solely under Art. 1166, because the requirement \nof direct causation will not be satisfied .159 The question is therefore whether , as the \nBank claims, Art. 1190 can be  applied in combination with Art. 1166 to modify the \ntest of causation  in cases of joint actions causing indivisible harm. \n616. The Court should prefer Mr Marchukov’s evidence on this issue.160 The experts have \nagreed that Art. 1190 cannot create liability where it would not otherwise exist and that \neach of the elements of Art. 1166 must be satisfied in relation to each tortfeasor  before \nArt. 1190 c an apply .161 Mr Beketov’s argument that Art. 1190 can  somehow modif y \nthe requirement of direct causation to hold liable a person whose actions were not a \ndirect cause of the harm , and therefore would not  satisfy  the requirements of Art. \n1166,  is inconsistent with this agreement and unsupported by Ukrainian court practice . \nAs Mr Marchukov explained in XX , none of the cases put to him  by the Bank show \nthe Ukrainian courts eliding the test of causation for tortious harm  under Art. 1166 \nwith the separate question of whether any such liability  should be borne  jointly under \nArt. 1190.162 Rather, they demonstrate that Art. 1190 will apply only after  each of the \ndefendants can be shown separately to have directly caused harm to the claimant  but \n \n159  Beketov XX {Day28/111:16 -24}. \n160  Marchukov1/25– 37 {C3/1/10 -15}; Marchukov2/18– 33 {C8/1/6 -12}. \n161  The experts have agreed that Art. 1190 “does not create a separate basis for liability. Rather, it provides for the \ncircumstances when the courts should hold each of the co -defendants who are liable to the claimant jointly and severally \nliable, meaning that each of the co -defendants must compen sate the full amount of damages suffered by the aggrieved party \n(as opposed to compensating th"}

Rather, it provides for the \ncircumstances when the courts should hold each of the co -defendants who are liable to the claimant jointly and severally \nliable, meaning that each of the co -defendants must compen sate the full amount of damages suffered by the aggrieved party \n(as opposed to compensating the victim only for the share of harm directly attributable to their own unlawful conduct)” : \nUkrLaw -JM/56.1 {C5/1/24}. Mr Beketov further agreed that where the claim against a defendant is \nmade in tort, each of the ingredients of Art. 1166 must be satisfied against them: {Day28/106:16}  –\n107:1 . \n162  See: {Day32/61: 1} –69:11 (re. the DTEK Power case {C9.8/32/1} ); {Day32/74:19} –79:2 (Gaz Ukrainy  \ncase {C3/20} ); {Day32/82:18} –86:16 (Ternopil City  case {C9.8/8} ); {Day32/94:2} –98:7 (BRSM ‘2’ \ncase {C9.12/10}). \nAA4/6/201\n198 \n the extent  of th e harm caused by each defendant individually cannot be determined  \n(i.e. there is indivisible  harm  caused by joint actions). \n617. It therefore follows that a person who merely procures the unlawful acts of another \ncannot be liable under Art. 1166, since their conduct will not be the direct cause of any \nharm. Art. 1190 is irrelevant to this analysis, since the necessary prior requirements of \nArt. 1166 are not made out. \n(2) Approval  and standing approval  \n618. The Bank  appears to have abandoned any case that Mr Bogolyubov could be liable for \nactions taken by Mr Kolomoisky on the basis that he gave Mr Kolomoisky his “express, \nimplied or standing approval” .163 It failed to challenge Mr Alyoshin and Mr Marchukov’s \nevidence164 that the act of giving approval  (express or implied)  to another cannot \nconstitute unlawful conduct for the purposes of a claim under Art. 1166  and its Closing \nputs the case firmly on the basis that Mr Bogolyubov jointly procured the ‘Scheme’ .165 \n619. Without prejudice to the failure of the Bank to put its case to the Defendants’ Ukrainian law experts,  any claim on this basis would in any event fail:  \n619.1  First, the experts agree that there is no concept of ‘standing approval’ in \nUkrainian law (Ukr.Law -JM/60.1 {C5/1/25} ) and that approving another’s \nconduct is not inherently unlawful: Beketov9/245 {C6/1/103} . While Mr \nBeketov  sought to caveat his agreement by speculating that an act of approval \ncould be unlawful if it resulted in the approver breaching a duty it owed to the claimant  or abusing some legitimate right it held, the re is no Ukrainian court \npractice supporting this approach and the Bank has not in any event advanced \nsuch a case. It has not identified any right that Mr Bogolyubov could have \nabused by allegedly approving Mr Kolomoisky’s supposed actions. Nor has it \nidentified any basis on which a person who did not know in advance the  \nspecific unlawful act ions that would be taken could  be in breach of duty  \n(indeed, as explained at para. 599 above, the Bank’s cross -examination of the \nUkrainian law experts in relation to fiduciary duties expressly assumed that the defendant knew of the misappropriation).  \n \n163  See the Bank’s Written Opening ¶459(5)(b) {AA2/1/187}. \n164  Alyoshin1/272 –273 {C2/1/101}; Marchukov1/43– 51 {C3/1/17 -19}. No questions concerning the \nlawfulness of approving another’s conduct were put to Mr Alyoshin or Mr Marchukov.  \n165  Bank’s Written Closing, ¶503 {AA2/15/282} . \nAA4/6/202\n199 \n 619.2  Second, the act of approval could not in any event be directly causative of any \nloss, since  any approval would only be an indirect or circumstantial cause.  \n619.3  T hird, even if simple ‘but for’ causation were relevant, the Bank has failed to \nestablish that Mr Bogolyubov’s approval was  a necessary element of the \n‘Scheme’.

Even if such approval had been sought and given  (for which there is \nno evidence at all), it cannot be safely inferred that such approval was necessary \nfor the ‘Scheme’ to proceed. The more probable inference is that the ‘Scheme’ would have taken place with or without Mr Bogolyubov’s approval.  The Bank ’s \ncharacterisation of D1  must be taken into account. \n619.4  F\nourth, Mr Beketov accepted that even on his view,  standing approval (and the \nsame must be true of express/implied approval)  could only ever lead to  liability \nif the additional  requirements of Art. 1190 are also satisfied.166 As agreed by the \nexperts, t his will only be the case where the act of approval and the act causing \nthe harm  can be said to be joint, because they  were “interrelated, \n[cumulative/collective] actions or actions with unity of intent” .167 While there is a debate \nas to whether a shared intention is a necessary requirement of this test, this \ndoes not need to be decided because  the Bank has put its case in Closing \nexpressly on the basis that D1 and D2 acted “with unity of intent (viz. to defraud the \nBank)” .168 It cannot be shown that there is a unity of intent  where approval is \ngiven only in general terms, without prior knowledge or approval of  the \nunlawful acts which go on to cause the loss, let alone where the approver does \nnot know that the other person intends to cause harm. \n(3) Article 1190 of the Civil Code  \n620. In view of the foregoing, Art. 1190 is of little relevance to the Bank’s claim. It is \ncommon ground that Art. 1190 does not provide a freestanding cause of action or \n \n166  {Day28/125:4- 7}. \n167  Ukr.Law -JM/56.3 {C5/1/24}. \n168  Bank’s Written Closing, ¶508(2) {AA2/15/284}. Were it necessary to decide the issue, the Court should \nfind that a unity of intent is required. Mr Beketov initially agreed that unity of intent was a requirement \nof Art. 1190 {Day28/123: 3-11} but then sought to retract this agreement while still maintaining that he \nwas “not saying 1190 doesn’t require unity of intent”  {Day28/126: 8} –127:17. The Court may find more \nassistance in the academic writing of Dr Chernilevska,  whose research is focussed on joint liability in \nUkrainian tort law, at {C9.10/1}. Dr Chernilevska ’s view is that actions can be considered interrelated \nfor the purposes of Art. 1190 only where (amongst other things) they “have been committed with a single \nintention – to achieve a certain goal (such a goal can be both legitimate or unlawful)”  {C9.10/1/2}. \nAA4/6/203\n200 \n render conduct unlawful  simply because that conduct when taken  in combination with \nthe actions of others  has caused harm: Ukr.Law -JM/56. 1–56.2 {C5/1/24} . It is plainly \nnot an equivalent of the English law tort of conspiracy  and cannot render Mr \nBogolyubov liable as an ‘accomplice’ to any unlawful actions by other Defendants . \nRather, w here it applies, the only consequence which follows from applying Art. 1190 \nis that defendants who would otherwise be liable for loss in shares  bear liability on a \njoint and several basis. Accordingly, this article does not provide any assistance to the \nBank in establishing its claim against Mr Bogolyubov. \nG. CONCLUSION  \n621.
