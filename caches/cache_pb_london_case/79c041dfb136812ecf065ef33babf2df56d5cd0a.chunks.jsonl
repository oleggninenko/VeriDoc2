Mr Seymour prepared a report dated 24 January 2022 (“ PS1”). \n In these reports the Experts were instructed to provide their opinion on the value of certain aircraft.  \n Save where expressly defined herein, the Experts use the same defined terms in this joint statement as in their reports.  \nMeetings of the Experts since their reports \n On 17 February 2022, the Experts met by video call to discuss on a without prejudice basis matters related to their instructions.  \nStructure of this joint statement \n Section 2 contains a summary of the Experts’ respective instructions.  \n Section 3 contains a summary of the Experts’ respective assessments.  \n Sections 4 to 8 contain a summary of the matters that are agreed and not agreed between the Experts in respect of: \n(i) overall conclusions; \n(ii) effect on valuation of differences in the Experts' respective instructions;  \n(iii) valuation methodology;  \n(iv) individual aircraft valuations; and \n(v) the reliability of the Veritas 2016 Valuation Reports.  \nDeclaration \n We the undersigned Experts individually here re-state the Expert’s Declaration contained in our respective reports that we understand our \noverriding duties are to the court and not the party appointing us, and that we have complied with them and will continue to do so. \n We further confirm that we have neither jointly nor individually been instructed to, nor has it been suggested that we should avoid or otherwise \nrefrain from reaching agreement on any matter within our competence. \n \nD15/1/2\nExpert Joint Statement between Olga Razzhivina and Philip Seymour \n 9th March 2022 \n \n3/20  \n  \n \n \nOlga Razzhivina                                                  Philip Seymour \nOriel Consult Limited                                             International Bureau of Aviation Group Limited  \n9th March 2022                                                 9th March 2022 \n \n \n \n \n \nD15/1/3\nExpert Joint Statement between Olga Razzhivina and Philip Seymour \n 9th March 2022 \n \n4/20 2. Summary of instructions \n The Experts set out their respective instructions at: \n \n(1) OR1: ¶¶22 to 24 and Exhibit OR3; and  \n(2) PS1: ¶¶2.1 to 2.4.  \n The Experts identify the main similarities and differences in their instructions below.  \nSubject of assessment \n Ms Razzhivina has been instructed to provide her opinion on the market value of the five aircraft (the \" Aircraft\") that the First Defendant relies \non in his Re-Re-Amended Defence (“ D1 RRAD ”) and “Schedule 2 ” to D1 RRAD.  The Aircraft are: \n \n(1) Airbus A321-200 MSN 2462 (the “ Airbus”); \n(2) Boeing 737-300, MSN 28659 (the “ Boeing 737 ”); \n(3) Boeing 767-300ER, MSN 25533 (the “ Boeing 767 533 ”);  \n(4) Boeing 767-300ER, MSN 25536 (the “ Boeing 767 536 ”); and \n(5) Embraer ERJ-145LR MSN 145-250 (the “ Embraer ”). \n \n Mr Seymour has been instructed to provide his opinion on the market value of the Aircraft, plus an additional four aircraft (the \" Additional Four \nAircraft\"), which Ms Olga Razzhivi"}

The Aircraft are: \n \n(1) Airbus A321-200 MSN 2462 (the “ Airbus”); \n(2) Boeing 737-300, MSN 28659 (the “ Boeing 737 ”); \n(3) Boeing 767-300ER, MSN 25533 (the “ Boeing 767 533 ”);  \n(4) Boeing 767-300ER, MSN 25536 (the “ Boeing 767 536 ”); and \n(5) Embraer ERJ-145LR MSN 145-250 (the “ Embraer ”). \n \n Mr Seymour has been instructed to provide his opinion on the market value of the Aircraft, plus an additional four aircraft (the \" Additional Four \nAircraft\"), which Ms Olga Razzhivina has not been instructed to value (PS1/2.1).  The Additional Four Aircraft are: \n \n(1) Airbus A321-200, MSN 2682; \n(2) Boeing 767-300ER, MSN 25280; \n(3) Embraer ERJ-145EP, MSN 145-290; and \n(4) Embraer ERJ-145EP, MSN 145-394. \n \n Ms Olga Razzhivina has been instructed to comment on contemporaneous third party valuations of the Aircraft (OR1/21 and Appendix D). Mr \nSeymour was not specifically instructed to comment on contemporaneous third party valuations but since they were disclosed and opined upon \nby Ms Razzhivina, Mr Seymour thought it useful for the Court, since it is within his area of expertise, to provide commentary in this regard. \nD15/1/4\nExpert Joint Statement between Olga Razzhivina and Philip Seymour \n 9th March 2022 \n \n5/20 \n Ms Razzhivina has been instructed to value the Aircraft under the 'market value' standard defined in the 2013 edition of the International \nValuation Standards (OR1/23).  \n Mr Seymour has been instructed to value the Aircraft under the 'market value' standard defined by the International Society of Transport Aircraft \nTrading (PS1/7.1).  \nDate of assessment \n Ms Razzhivina has been instructed to perform her valuations as of 22 August 2016 (OR1/22).  \n Mr Seymour has been instructed to perform his valuations as of 16 August 2016 (PS1/2.1). \n3. Summary of assessments in OR1 and PS1 \n The Experts summarise their respective assessments of the Aircraft in the table below. \n \nAircraft Ms Razzhivina’s valuation (US$) \n(OR1/Table 30) Mr Seymour’s valuation (US$) (PS1/4.1)  \nAirbus 16,790,000  24,749,000  \nBoeing 737 3,750,000  3,127,0001 \nBoeing 767 533 8,850,000  8,452,000  \nBoeing 767 536 8,270,000  7,240,000  \nEmbraer 1,090,000  2,370,000  \n \n1 Mr Seymour has changed his valuation as per 7.12 below. \nD15/1/5\nExpert Joint Statement between Olga Razzhivina and Philip Seymour \n 9th March 2022 \n \n6/20  \n Mr Seymour summarises his assessments of the Additional Four Aircraft in the table below. \n \nAircraft Mr Seymour’s valuation (US$) (PS1/4.1) \nAirbus A321-200, MSN 2682 27,235,000  \nBoeing 767-300ER, MSN 25280 5,990,000  \nEmbraer ERJ-145EP, MSN 145-290 2,274,000  \nEmbraer ERJ-145EP, MSN 145-394 3,095,000  \n \n4. Overall conclusions \nMatters agreed \nNo Issue Experts’ agreement  \n Valuation methodology The Experts agree on the use of the comparative valuation method (see 6.1 below). \n The Airbus has suffered \ndamage The subject aircraft has suffered damage (OR1/123; Source: PB0363494_00001). \n The Boeing 737 published \nstarting point values are \nwithin a reasonable range Ms Razzhivina’s published value for Boeing 737 is $2.75m (OR1/I83).  Mr Seymour’s published value for \nBoeing 737 is $2.79m (PS1/9.12).  The variance is $0.04m. The Experts agree that this variance is within a \nreasonable range. \n The Boeing 767 533 \nvaluation is within a \nreasonable range Ms Razzhivina opines on the Retrospective Market Adjusted Value of $8.85m (OR1/Table 20).  Mr \nSeymour opines on the Retrospective Market Adjusted Value of $8.45m (PS1/13.7). The variance is \n$0.40m. The Experts agree that this variance is within a reasonable range. \nD15/1/6\nExpert Joint Statement between Olga Razzhivina and Philip Seymour \n 9th March 2022 \n \n7/20 No Issue Experts’ agreement  \n Veritas 2016 Valuation \nReports The Experts agree that the Veritas 2016 Valuation Reports are unreliable. \nMatters not agreed \nNo Issue Ms Razzhivina  Mr Seymour  \n  The $5.21m \nvariance in the \npublished \nvalues of the \nAirbus used as \na starting point \nin the valuati"}

This value was published on the OrielVIP \nonline platform and valid in August 2016.  The published value of $24.01m was based on Mr \nSeymour’s market knowledge and was published in the \nIBA AVB (PS1/Appendix 17). The market value provided \nwas only slightly below the Base Value given the opinion \npublished in the AVB at the time, which was: “ The A321-\n200 performed well under various market conditions ” \n  Applying a \ndiscount to the \nAirbus’ value \nbecause of \ndamage Significant damage to aircraft creates a stigma of \ndamage which will result in a discount to the value, \ntypically expressed in percentage to the value.  \nRegardless of the quality of repairs, such discount \napplies. Ms Razzhivina quantifies the minimum \ndiscount at 10% of the Retrospective Adjusted Market \nValue (OR1/125-127). \n \nThe 8 influencing factors stated by Mr Seymour are \nviewed by Ms Razzhivina to be in addition to the 10% \ndiscount she assesses. Damage to aircraft creates a stigma of damage which \nmay result into a discount to the value. While the fact of \ndamage may create a discount to the value of an aircraft \nit cannot be quantified without knowing the details of the \nrepairs and their quality. PS assesses each aircraft \ndamage a per a “diminution in value” template which \nconsiders 8 influencing factors: the nature of the \ndamage; area damaged; certification status; \nairworthiness limitations; OEM participation; \nworkmanship/cosmetic/aesthetics; beneficial \nconsequences such as structural design improvement \nand warranty applied. Therefore PS was unable to \nproperly assess the valuation implication.  (PS1/10.10).  \n  The Boeing 767 \n536 $1.03m \ndifference in \ntotal valuation Ms Razzhivina opines on the Retrospective Market \nAdjusted Value of $8.27m (OR1/Table 25).

This value was published on the OrielVIP \nonline platform and valid in August 2016.   \n \nThe total maintenance adjustment to the Embraer \nvalue is - $613,441 (OR1/Table 28). The published value of $2.69m was based on Mr \nSeymour’s market knowledge and was published in the \nIBA AVB (PS1/Appendix 27). \n \nThe total maintenance adjustment to the Embraer value \nis -$320,000 (PS1/15.10). \n5.

Methodology \nThe use of comparative methodology  \nMatters agreed \nNo Issue Experts’ agreement  \n The Aircraft were valued \nusing a comparative \nmethodology  The valuation of Aircraft was conducted by both Experts using the comparative method which is an \naccepted industry practice (OR1/48-50, PS1/6.4). \nThe reliance by experts on market data points \nMatters agreed \nNo Issue Experts’ agreement  \n The use of market data \npoints in the Aircraft \nvaluation Both Experts have relied on confidential and public data points in conducting their valuations in August \n2016 (OR1/Appendix C, PS1/6.1-6.7).   \n The market data points \navailable to each Expert \nmay differ Each Expert is individually responsible for collecting market data points.  Because the majority of market \ndata points are confidential, each Expert would have relied on a different set of data points which may have \nresulted in differences in the Experts’ values published in August 2016. \nThe use of published values as the starting point of the valuation  \nMatters agreed \nNo Issue Experts’ agreement  \n Experts relied on their \npublished values from \nAugust 2016 Each Expert has published their initial values in August 2016.  Mr Seymour published them in the IBA AVB \npublication (PS1/6.8).  Ms Razzhivina has published them via the Oriel online valuation platform, OrielVIP \n(OR1/63).  Each Expert relied on data points available to them at the time. The use of these published \nvalues prevents the influence of hindsight.   \nD15/1/9\nExpert Joint Statement between Olga Razzhivina and Philip Seymour \n 9th March 2022 \n \n10/20 The following table lays out the 2016 ‘published’ generic values before adjusting for specification and maintenance status of the Aircraft.  \nAircraft Ms Razzhivina’s published values \n(“Stage 1” OR1/I50, I83, I104, I133) (US$) Mr Seymour’s published values (PS1/4.1)  \n(US$) \nAirbus 18,800,000  24,010,000  \nBoeing 737 2,750,000  2,790,000  \nBoeing 767 533 7,250,000  7,670,000  \nBoeing 767 536 7,850,000  8,370,000  \nEmbraer 1,700,000  2,690,000  \n \n7.

The market value provided \nwas only slightly below the Base Value given the opinion \npublished in the AVB at the time, which was: “ The A321-\n200 performed well under various market conditions ” \n  Treatment of 6-\nyear and 12-\nyear check for \nthe purpose of \nmaintenance \nadjustment The 6-year check is superseded by the 12-year check \nand should not be adjusted for separately (OR1/92-\n96). \n \nIf the 6-year and 12-year checks were to be adjusted \nfor separately (which Ms Razzhivina does not consider \nto be correct), the cost of the 12-check has to be \nadjusted to reflect exclusion of the 6-year check tasks.  \nUsing Mr Seymour’s costs the adjustment is as follows: \n$1,200,000 - $800,000 = $400,000 (PS1/10.12).  The \nresulting adjustment for the 12-year check should be: \n$400,000/144*(144/2-15) = $158,333. The 6-year and 12-year checks are adjusted for \nindividually (PS1/10.12) Normally, PS would agree that \nthe 6 and 12 year checks would be coincident, that is the \n12 year should encompass the 6 year tasks. In this case \nPS  saw that the aircraft  (delivered in 2005) had a 6 \nyear check in 2011 (as would be expected) but had a 12 \nyear prematurely in 2015 (at only 10 years old) hence \nPS decided to split the valuation of each check. It \ncreates a difference in the order of 300KUSD increase to \nPS’s valuation if he combines the two checks. Without \nknowing exactly which of the check workcards were \naccomplished or deferred it makes the detailed analysis \nimpossible to assess. Whilst PS agrees that normally the \n6 and 12 year checks would be combined, in this case \nbelieves the separation is valid.  \n  Landing Gear \nmaintenance \nstatus Ms Razzhivina found no information about the status \nof the subject aircraft’s Landing Gear (OR1/119). Mr Seymour states 9 months left until overhaul based on \nthe assumption that the original landing gear remained \nfitted at the time of the appraisal and was of the same \nage as the airframe. (PS1/10.12). \nD15/1/11\nExpert Joint Statement between Olga Razzhivina and Philip Seymour \n 9th March 2022 \n \n12/20 No Issue Ms Razzhivina  Mr Seymour  \n  Applying a \ndiscount to the \nAirbus’ value \nbecause of \ndamage Significant damage to aircraft creates a stigma of \ndamage which will result into a discount to the value, \ntypically expressed in percentage to the value.  \nRegardless of the quality of repairs, such discount \napplies.

Therefore PS was unable to \nproperly assess the valuation implication.  (PS1/10.10).  \nBoeing 737-300 (MSN 28659) \nMatters agreed \nNo Issue Experts’ agreement  \n The published starting point \nvalues are within normal \nvariance Ms Razzhivina’s published value for Boeing 737 is $2.75m (OR1/I83).  Mr Seymour’s published value for \nBoeing 737 is $2.79m (PS1/9.12). The variance is $0.04m. The Experts agree that this variance is within a \nreasonable range. \n The Boeing 737’s \nmaximum take-off weight \n(MTOW) difference Ms Razzhivina records the Boeing 737’s MTOW at 136,500lb (OR1/Table F4).  Mr Seymour records the \nBoeing 737’s MTOW at 135,000lb (PS1/3.1).  Ms Razzhivina assigns a value adjustment of $0.004m in \nrespect of the MTOW (OR1/132).  Mr Seymour does not assign any adjustment (PS1/9.11).  The variance \nis $0.004m.

Experts agree that due to no maintenance information available for the Boeing 737’s title engines, MSNs \n858536 and 858535 (OR1/146), it is accepted industry practice for the maintenance adjustment for the title \nengine overhaul and title engine LLPs to be treated as zero ($0m) (OR1/146-150).
