The fraud contributed to the failure of the Bank in 2016 and its nationalisation in December of that year, following which an investigation led the Bank – now under new ownership and management – to discover what had happened.  2 That fraud – referred to in these proceedings as the “Misappropriation” – concerned the extraction of more than US$1.9bn from the Bank, using a complex network of vehicles owned and/or controlled by D1-2, and with the connivance of senior executives within the Bank. In a nutshell, it operated as follows:  (1) Funds were extracted from the Bank via “Relevant Loans” advanced – in flagrant breach of the rules and regulations to which the Bank’s lending was subject, on patently preferential and improper terms, and without any proper scrutiny – to 50 “Borrowers” with no genuine credit or trading history, no business activity and no prospect of making legitimate repayment of the sums they received.  (2) The “Relevant Drawdowns” made by the Borrowers under those Relevant Loans were then transferred by them, in US$, to non-Ukrainian “Supplier” companies, purportedly as “Prepayments” under “Supply Agreements”. Those Supply Agreements – which were on uncommercial and frequently ludicrous terms – were shams, executed simply to provide the Borrowers with a pretext for moving foreign currency out of Ukraine (and in consequence enabling them to circumvent Ukrainian regulations restricting the export of currency). (3) Until September 2014, following receipt of Prepayments by the Suppliers, the monies would then typically be ‘recycled’: within 90 days of receipt, a Supplier would return the Prepayment it had received under a Supply Agreement to the Borrower, and the Borrower would then use that repayment to fund another Prepayment under another Supply Agreement (with further sums drawn down to fund “FX Top-Ups” to achieve the same amount in US$). The cycle would then repeat itself, sometimes on multiple occasions. The diagram below, prepare"}

The cycle would then repeat itself, sometimes on multiple occasions. The diagram below, prepared by the Bank’s forensic accountancy expert,2 illustrates the paradigm steps in the scheme:  1  Judgment of the Court of Appeal in these proceedings at [22], quoting the first instance judgment of Fancourt J at [104] {A5/12/5}. 2  Thompson1/Figure 3-2 {D1/1/35}. \nAA2/1/7\n 2            (4) None of the transactions in this ‘recycling’ operation was a legitimate commercial arrangement: to the contrary, this back-and-forth was simply a device to launder the funds the Borrowers had drawn down from the Bank, whilst ensuring (ostensible) compliance with Ukrainian foreign exchange regulations prescribing a 90-day maximum period between Prepayment and delivery or return of funds. It is doubtless for this reason that the Supply Agreements were contemporaneously referred to as the “Currency Contracts project” {E6/82P}. (5) However, there came a point in the latter half of 2014, following increasing scrutiny by the Bank’s regulator (the National Bank of Ukraine or “NBU”), when the music stopped. The Borrowers ceased to make any further Relevant Drawdowns, and six of the Suppliers – viz. D3-8 – which had received Prepayments under sham “Relevant Supply Agreements / RSAs”3 failed to return those Prepayments to the Borrowers. The upshot was that the Borrowers had extracted net unrepaid Relevant Drawdowns totalling over US$1.9bn, and D3-8 had failed to return “Unreturned Prepayments” to the Borrowers (the source of which was the Relevant Drawdowns).4 That sum is the loss that the Bank claims was caused to it by the Misappropriation.   (6) Multiple steps were taken to cover up the Misappropriation and evade scrutiny from the NBU. In particular: (i) a variety of purported security was put in place to support  3  In these proceedings, the Relevant Supply Agreements are those pursuant to which the Unreturned Prepayments were transferred to D3-8. They are otherwise similar to the earlier Supply Agreements. 4  AccountancyJR/¶2.2(c) {D4/1/4}. \nAA2/1/8\n 3 the Relevant Loans, none of which offered the Bank any genuine protection or was intended to be (or was) enforced; (ii) the Bank advanced further fraudulent loans (the “Intermediary Loans”), the proceeds of which were purportedly used to ‘repay’ the Relevant Loans; and (iii) 51 sets of proceedings were issued by the Borrowers against D3-8 in Ukraine for return of the Unreturned Prepayments; those “2014 Ukrainian Proceedings” – which were brought with the collusion of D3-8 and the Bank, in reliance upon sham documentation created especially for use in the claims – were not pursued for any genuine purpose of enforcement, but rather to (i) avoid the Borrowers incurring fines for breach of the ‘90-day’ rule; and (ii) make it appear as though the Borrowers had plausible excuse for not repaying the Relevant Loans. (7) The Misappropriation was orchestrated by and for the benefit of D1-2, who owned and/or controlled both the Bank and the vast web of companies used to extract and launder the monies including, in particular, the Borrowers and D3-8. Unsurprisingly, given the scale of the fraud, they had assistance in its execution, not only from senior executives of the Bank loyal to them, but also from two ostensibly separate entities, “PBC” and “Primecap”, which were in reality entities owned and/or controlled by D1-2, whose function was to administer D1-2’s corporate network. 3 There is a wealth of evidence to establish the Misappropriation, and the Defendants’ involvement in it.

Unsurprisingly, given the scale of the fraud, they had assistance in its execution, not only from senior executives of the Bank loyal to them, but also from two ostensibly separate entities, “PBC” and “Primecap”, which were in reality entities owned and/or controlled by D1-2, whose function was to administer D1-2’s corporate network. 3 There is a wealth of evidence to establish the Misappropriation, and the Defendants’ involvement in it.  In particular, three core factual themes can be identified at the outset, which feature throughout these written opening submissions. 4 First, the documentary evidence found on the Bank’s own files itself shows that the fraud indisputably took place: (1) An analysis of the documents relating to the Relevant Loans shows that they were manifestly shams designed to facilitate the extraction of monies from the Bank.  The Borrowers were shell companies with no business activity or trading history (indeed, 31 of them were, taking their own accounts at face value, balance sheet insolvent at all times), the terms of the loans were uncommercial and preferential, and the Bank’s so-called approval process was simply a rubber-stamping exercise coordinated by insiders loyal to D1-2.  (2) The RSAs were even more obvious shams. No goods were delivered under them, and neither D3-8 nor the Borrowers had the capacity or wherewithal to comply with their supposed obligations. Moreover, the commodities D3-8 contracted to supply were frequently ludicrous: for example, D5 (a company which filed total exemption \nAA2/1/9\n 4 accounts) entered into RSAs in May-August 2014 under which it agreed to supply 2.4m tons (US$775m) of Australian manganese ore to Odessa by December 2014; that volume was 28 times the manganese imported into Ukraine in 2014, and 30% of Australia’s entire annual production {F1/86/5} (¶3(b). (3) A contemporaneous record of the Misappropriation was maintained by two associates of D1-2 in the Bank in the form of the “Gurieva Spreadsheet” and “Kazantsev Spreadsheet” (named after the individuals on whose devices they were found, Tatiana Gurieva and Oleksiy Kazantsev, both of whom worked in a secretive department within the Bank known as “BOK” and had close associations with D1-2). The Kazantsev Spreadsheet {E7/39P} tracks the ‘recycling’ of prepayments back and forth between Borrowers and Suppliers. The Gurieva Spreadsheet {E18/213P} identifies the Unreturned Prepayments, links them (where applicable) with the return of prior prepayments, and links each Borrower’s indebtedness to the Bank to an Unreturned Prepayment. In other words, it contains a snapshot of the whole Misappropriation. Both Spreadsheets identify the sum of the outstanding Unreturned Prepayments as US$1,911,877,385. 5 Second, there is copious evidence to show that D1-2 controlled, through their loyal associates, all entities involved in the fraud: (1) Control of the Bank: D1-2’s control of the Bank, established by their 90% shareholding and positions on the Supervisory Board, was absolute. Trusted lieutenants, who could be relied upon to act on D1-2’s instructions, occupied senior positions within the Bank; more junior employees, for fear of losing their jobs, simply did what they were told. Secretive departments existed within the Bank – including BOK, headed by Gurieva, and the “Investment Business” division, led by D1’s “right hand man”5 Timur Novikov, whose function was to service D1-2’s network of companies. An “Electronic Credit Committee / ECC” – staffed by inter alios Gurieva and Novikov, and chaired by another D1-2 crony and Chair of the Bank, Oleksandr Dubilet – approved loans to D1-2’s companies electronically, with no prior discussion and without ever actually meeting.

However, that is simply the tip of the iceberg: as demonstrated by the Structure and Nominee Charts prepared by the Bank (the contents of which are largely agreed by the Defendants), the purported beneficial owners of the Borrowers and D3-8 were – with minor exceptions – PBC employees who D1-2 admit hold other assets for them, frequently pursuant to oral agreements.6 The contemporaneous “Luchaninov Email” {E8/163} and “Rokoman Email” {E10/264} further demonstrate how D1-2 – with the assistance of BOK employees – made use of nominees to disguise their ownership and control of Borrowers; those nominees would be swapped around as and when necessary to ensure the “removal of … connections” linking the Borrowers with D1-2. The only conclusion to be drawn is that D1-2 were the owners and/or controllers of all of these vehicles. (3) Role of Primecap and PBC: That conclusion is corroborated by the fact that the Borrowers and D3-8 were administered and managed by Primecap (staffed by former Bank employees) and PBC, both of which were helmed by associates loyal to D1-2 (Novikov in the case of Primecap, and Sergei Melnyk in the case of PBC), and, despite half-hearted protestations to the contrary, were themselves owned and/or controlled by D1-2. (4) The ‘no record’ modus operandi: Tellingly, D1-2 sought to leave no documentary record of their dealings with their network of trusted associates at the Bank, PBC and Primecap. D1 eschewed email communications and destroyed hard copy documents, with both men using a private phone network called ‘the Black’, which left no records, and instant messenger services such as WhatsApp. The originally heavily redacted WhatsApp messages provide confirmation of the way D1-2 ran their affairs, by using their team of lieutenants and subordinates to do their bidding.  The tortuous process by which this and other key material was extracted from D1 was recently described by the Court as “akin to squeezing blood out of a stone and is far removed from compliance with [D1’s] obligations to co-operate with the court in furthering the overriding objective”: {A5/27/13} at [42]. (5) Admitted use of D1-2’s companies and assets as purported security: Even on their own case, D1-2 admit ownership interests in assets pledged, and the companies which pledged them, as purported security for the Relevant Loans in the form of  6  As to which D2’s account has vacillated: see further ¶67 below. \nAA2/1/11\n 6 “Share Pledges”7 (which D1’s own valuation expert agrees were massively overstated in value {D12/1/55}, and which were in any event released shortly prior to the Bank’s nationalisation). Although D1-2 suggest that they made their assets available to the Bank simply “to improve the Bank’s capital and/or financial position”, and not “because he had (or was aware of having) any interest in the borrowers whose loans were thus secured”,8 it is inherently incredible that D1-2 would be willing to pledge (on their case) valuable assets to secure lending to third-party borrowers with whom they had no connection. A similar conclusion applies in relation to the 2016 “Asset Transfer”, pursuant to which assets in which D1-2 admit ownership interests were purportedly used (again, with massively overstated valuations) to reduce the outstanding balances on (inter alia) the "}

A similar conclusion applies in relation to the 2016 “Asset Transfer”, pursuant to which assets in which D1-2 admit ownership interests were purportedly used (again, with massively overstated valuations) to reduce the outstanding balances on (inter alia) the Relevant Loans.  (6) Implausibility of anyone else controlling the relevant entities. The logical consequence of D1-2’s own case on control is that, if the transactions were indeed a massive fraud, then D1-2 were the victims and not the perpetrators, even though (i) the individuals who undertook the fraudulent transactions were D1-2’s close associates; (ii) the fraud involved companies in which they admit interests; (iii) D1-2 provided their own assets as purported security for lending to those companies; and (iv) D1-2 used more of their own assets purportedly to repay, in part, those companies’ loans. That is unreal: there is no way that D1-2’s Bank, companies and assets could have been exploited in this manner without their involvement and sanction (indeed, the disclosure indicates that D1-2 involved themselves in the intricate details of their businesses). Further, the perpetrators of the fraud must have included D1-2’s trusted associates – amongst them Novikov, Gurieva and Melnyk – who controlled the Borrowers and D3-8; however, far from taking any action against them, D1-2 continue to work closely with them, and still trust them to administer/hold assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars pursuant to oral agreements. That is because they carried out the fraud for D1-2, not against them. 6 Third, there is the absence of any explanation for the transactions from the Defendants, coupled with their remarkable last-minute decision to advance no factual evidence at all in their defence, either from themselves or from their close associates who undertook the transactions:  7  D1Def/¶¶17 {A1/8/13}, 20(3) {A1/8/15}; Sch. 6 {A1/17}. D2 has adopted D1’s position: see Enyo (22.6.22, 2nd) {L/76.1}, Hogan Lovells (6.7.22) {L/82} and Enyo (2.8.22, 2nd) {L/85}. 8  D1Def/¶20(3)(d) {A1/8/15}; D2Def/¶30(4) {A1/18/14}; D2 RRFI {A2/39.2/2}.  \nAA2/1/12\n 7 (1) Despite D1’s Leading Counsel accepting as far back as July 2018 that “obviously, if the matter ever goes to trial one would need to explain what was going on and why this was being done and so on, whether there was any dishonest intent” {G3/12/8} (28:2-5), the Defendants have made no attempt to proffer any explanation for the Relevant Loans, the RSAs or the other transactions comprising the Misappropriation.  (2) Instead, D1-2 have retreated to pleading a case that they have no knowledge of these transactions.9 Indeed, D1 pleads that his “primary defence” is one going to loss,10 and has suggested in correspondence that details of the impugned transactions (as set out in the Bank’s 176 Statements of Facts (“SOFs”), the accuracy of which the Defendants have all belatedly accepted)11 are “insignifican[t] … to his defence” {PTR2-F1/45/2}. D2 pleads that “[i]t is denied that the only plausible explanation for the grant of the Relevant Loans is that the Borrowers were owned and controlled by Mr Bogolyubov”,12 but gives no hint as to what those other “plausible explanation[s]” might be. (3) This pleaded case of ignorance is wholly inconsistent with what D1-2 said when challenging jurisdiction. At that time, D1 (in a position adopted by D2) accepted that he and his agents had detailed knowledge of the transactions comprising the Misappropriation. He sought to explain those transactions by contending that the Bank had misunderstood the “Scheme” (D1’s own term13), and that all the money which had been extracted from the Bank was repaid to the Bank in various convoluted ways.

He sought to explain those transactions by contending that the Bank had misunderstood the “Scheme” (D1’s own term13), and that all the money which had been extracted from the Bank was repaid to the Bank in various convoluted ways. This stance was manifested in the generation (in an extraordinarily short period of time) of the notorious, thoroughly discredited and now abandoned “Lafferty Spreadsheets”, purporting to show the return of the loaned monies to the Bank. According to D1’s own evidence, the Lafferty Spreadsheets were prepared for D1 from transactional data stolen from the Bank by his “sources”, comprising “former employees of the Bank, who were aware of the transaction patterns … and the companies involved in the Scheme”;14 those “sources” were subsequently revealed – after the Bank obtained an order from the Court compelling D1 to do so – as a team of individuals from BOK and Primecap, including Gurieva (of the eponymous spreadsheet).

(4) Added to this stark inconsistency is the fact that both D1-2 are now unwilling to attend Court to be cross-examined on their assertions of ignorance, and the wider absence of any factual evidence from any Defendant. This leads to a string of adverse inferences to be drawn against all of the Defendants, and specifically against: (a) D1-2, for electing – nearly 18 months after filing their trial evidence, and despite having secured an adjournment in March 2022 on the basis that the Russian invasion meant that they would “be unable to give oral evidence at the trial itself, whether in person or by videolink”16 – not to attend to confirm the truth of that evidence on oath and be cross-examined on the same.  This belated volte-face was doubtless a consequence of D1-2’s recognition that disclosure gradually extracted from them over the past 15 months would reveal that their prior attempts to distance themselves from the fraud, from the vehicles who participated in it, from the individuals who executed it, and from the operations of the Bank, were all untruthful.  (b) D1, for the failure to attend trial of the three other witnesses who provided statements for him – amongst them Volodymyr Yatsenko, a former First Deputy Chair of the Bank, who had admitted in his written evidence that the Bank used sham supply agreements to evade currency control restrictions: Yatsenko1/¶¶39, 46 {B2/4/6-7}.  The failure to call Yatsenko is striking given that he was on the ECC which approved each of the Relevant Loans. (c) D1-2, for failing to adduce evidence from key associates – including Novikov, Gurieva, Dubilet, Melnyk and Kazantsev – with direct knowledge of the transactions comprising the Misappropriation. That omission is instructive given that those individuals variously (i) gave written evidence for D1 at the jurisdiction stage of these proceedings (Kazantsev); (ii) provided direct assistance to D1 ‘behind the scenes’ in these proceedings (Novikov, Gurieva); (iii) were able and willing to give evidence for D1 in other English  15  See Court of Appeal judgment at [244] {A5/12/62}: “… neither Mr Kolomoisky nor anyone else who played a part in the preparation of the Lafferty Spreadsheets has attempted to explain in evidence the myriad of transactions showing no evident"}

In the circumstances, the judge ought, we think, to have approached the Lafferty Spreadsheets with caution”. 16  D2’s skeleton argument for the PTR on 28-29.3.22, ¶23(1)(b) {PTR-A/5/10}; see also D1’s skeleton argument for the same hearing ¶39 {PTR-A/4/17}, ¶¶54(3)-(5) {PTR-A/4/25}.  \nAA2/1/14\n 9 Court proceedings (Novikov); (iv) were listed in D1-2’s asset disclosure as holding assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars for D1-2 pursuant to “oral agreements” (Melnyk); (v) were members of the ECC which approved the loans (Dubilet, Novikov, Gurieva); and (vi) have remained in close contact with D1-2 long after the Bank’s nationalisation (all of the above). (d) D1-2 (again), for their selective, self-serving and deficient approach to disclosure, including the deletion of documents from the relevant period and applying inappropriate redactions to their WhatsApp messages.  (e) D3-8, for failing to adduce evidence from any factual witness whatsoever in defence of the claims against them, notwithstanding that a beneficial owner of D3-5 is, purportedly, the ubiquitous Melnyk.  Conveniently, the directors of D3-8 who were in place at the time of the Misappropriation all resigned within months of the Court of Appeal’s judgment.  7 Turning to legal liability, the Bank’s case is that the Defendants’ participation in the Misappropriation undoubtedly constitutes “unlawful conduct” for the purposes of Art. 1166 of the Ukrainian Civil Code, which establishes general tortious liability for property damage (including economic loss). The basic proposition that Supervisory Board members who orchestrate a US$1.9bn fraud on their bank commit an actionable tort is irresistible.  8 D1-2 raise a slew of (increasingly implausible) Ukrainian law arguments in a bid to evade liability under Art. 1166, including that (i) the Misappropriation is criminal in nature, and the Bank does not have a civil remedy absent a criminal conviction; (ii) the fiduciary duties they owed as Supervisory Board members were not breached, even by the commission of a fraud against the Bank, so long as their actions were undertaken ‘behind the scenes’ and not pursuant to the execution of their duties qua Supervisory Board members; and (iii) it is wrong to say that “a member of the supervisory board who orchestrates or otherwise participates in a scheme to embezzle funds from their bank will necessarily breach their duties to the bank under Article 43 of the Law on Banks [imposing a duty to protect the bank’s interests]”.17 9 These (and other) Ukrainian law defences should be rejected. In this regard, the Court will be assisted by the analysis of Bryan J in National Bank Trust v Yurov [2020] EWHC 100 (Comm) (“NBT”) {M1/22}, which concerned a very similar fraud perpetrated by the former owners of a Russian bank via lending to a network of their own companies.

Although the case was governed by Russian law, the various arguments raised by the Defendants in this case fail, in large part, for essentially the same reasons as in NBT.  10 D3-8’s receipt of the Unreturned Prepayments further gives rise to liability in unjust enrichment pursuant to Art. 1212 of the Civil Code. D3-5’s primary defence is that they entered into the RSAs, and received the Unreturned Prepayments, as agents for undisclosed principals; the reality, however, is that these “Alleged Agency Agreements” were shams, and the “Alleged Principals” yet further companies within D1-2’s network. 11 As regards quantum, the Bank’s case is that its loss is the principal sum of c. US$1.9bn less only a small credit for the true value of assets genuinely transferred during the Asset Transfer where such assets can be shown to have been applied to the Relevant Drawdowns. D1’s assertion (indeed his “primary defence”) is that the Relevant Drawdowns were all repaid, such that the Bank has not suffered any loss.  However, save for the Asset Transfer – for which a limited credit (and far less than D1 contends) is appropriate – this “Repayment Defence” is untenable, because the purported repayments were all funded by further fraudulent borrowing from the Bank. As a matter of Ukrainian law, and of basic principle, such further fraudulent lending does not reduce the Bank’s loss. 12 In the alternative, D1-2 advance a “Use of Funds Defence”: “the Bank suffered no loss to the extent that funds advanced were transferred back to the Bank”.18 However, even D1’s own Ukrainian law expert agrees that the Use of Funds Defence is not available as a matter of principle when quantifying loss;19 further, the defence is simply a re-run of arguments advanced by the shareholders in NBT which were rejected by Bryan J in that case as “ultimately misconceived in principle” at [1206] {M1/22/376} (because, even if it could be shown that a fraudulently procured loan drawdown was used to repay some other bank lending, such repayment would not reduce the bank’s loss – irrespective of whether the other lending was genuine or also fraudulent). The argument fails for the same reasons in this case. 13 The Defendants plead a miscellany of further arguments, including (i) limitation; (ii) preclusion (under both Ukrainian and English law); and (iii) that these proceedings are part  18  D1Def/¶56 {A1/8/30}. 19  UkrJR/¶45.2 {C5/1/20}. \nAA2/1/16\n 11 of a politically motivated conspiracy.  These points need not detain the Court for long: (i) time did not start running, for the purposes of the Ukrainian law of limitation, for as long as the Bank remained under the control of D1-2; (ii) the Bank did not act inconsistently, nor did it act in bad faith, nor did D1-2 reasonably rely on any such actions to their detriment, such as to engage any potential doctrine of preclusion; and (iii) D1-2’s allegations of political motivation were finally abandoned (over five years after they were first made) yesterday afternoon.     \nAA2/1/17\n 12 B THE BANK IN 2013 – 2016  14 This Section introduces the Bank and its most important internal bodies and personnel, and the key events at the Bank from 2013-2016, while it was under the control of D1-2.

As at 31.12.16, it had 30 regional offices and 2,445 branches in Ukraine, a branch in Cyprus, an associate bank in Latvia, and representative offices in Kyiv and London {K1/6/15}. The Bank was one of Ukraine’s systemic banks, such that its failure would have threatened the wider economy. As of 30.9.12, the Bank had c. 13m individual customers (c. 35% of Ukraine’s adult population), and had issued c. 35.3m bank cards (c. 54% of the cards in circulation) {E1/255/16, 164}.  16 The Bank was founded by D1-2 in March 1992. As explained below, D1-2 collectively owned or controlled over 90% of the Bank’s share capital between 2013 and the Bank’s nationalisation in December 2016. 17 The Bank’s formal governance had a two-tier structure, with the Management Board being responsible for its day-to-day operation and its Supervisory Board appointing the members, and overseeing the performance, of the Management Board: (1) As the Bank’s majority shareholders, D1-2 sat on the Supervisory Board from 2003 (D2) / 2004 (D1) until the Bank’s nationalisation. Until about May 2015 (see {E9/95/31}, agenda items 19-20), the Supervisory Board comprised three members: D2 (Chair), D1 and Aleksey Martynov. Membership of the Supervisory Board was thereafter increased to five: Volodymyr Stelmakh (Chair), D1, D2, Martynov and Victor Lisitskyi. (2) In 2013-2016, the Bank’s Management Board comprised c. 12-14 members,20 many of whom are of relevance to the Bank’s claim. Amongst them were: Dubilet (Chair); Yuriy Pikush (General Deputy Chair); Novikov, Yatsenko and Oleg Gorokhovsky (the First Deputy Chairmen, who were also respectively Head of the Investment Business, the Corporate VIP business, and the ‘Credit Cards and Salaries’ departments); and further Deputy Chairmen including Gurieva (Head of the Customer Service Business department, known as ‘BOK’), Lyubov Chmona  20  See the Bank’s financial statements: {K1/3/10} (2013), {K1/4/10} (2014), {K1/5/10} (2015), {K1/6.1/8} (H1 2016).   \nAA2/1/18\n 13 (Head of Business Budgeting for Industrial and Commercial Companies) and Lyudmila Shmalchenko (Head of Treasury). 18 Underneath the Management Board sat a number of ‘Business Divisions’, ‘Regional Divisions’ (each focusing on customers in a specific region) and ‘Supporting Divisions’ (such as the Bank’s IT, compliance, security, legal and tax departments). The Bank’s c. 27,000 staff {E1/255/175} were employed by a range of different departments within those divisions. An organisational chart as of 7.4.16 is found at {E4/101}; a simplified chart depicting the key organs, departments and employees for the purposes of this case appears at ¶26 below.  19 Three of the Bank’s ‘Business Divisions’ assume particular importance: 20 First, BOK, which provided services to the Bank’s “strategic customers”, i.e. companies owned and/or controlled by D1-2: Luchaninov/¶¶13-14 {B1/3/5}; Lozytska/¶14 {B1/6/5}. It was, as already noted, headed by Gurieva. It operated in a secretive manner as a ‘bank within a bank’: its offices were physically separate from other departments (Lozytska/¶¶16-17 {B1/6/5}) and its client files were kept in hard copy in sealed cabinets under lock and key (ibid.).21 BOK’s clients included all 47 Ukrainian Borrowers and the Intermediary Borrowers. In addition to Gurieva, other BOK employees mentioned below include Maryna Lozytska (a Bank witness), Liliya Rokoman (Lozytska’s boss), Kazantsev and Olga Koryak (who gave evidence for D1 on his jurisdiction challenge in 2018, but will not feature at trial), Dymtri Plyska and Artem Chernyshov. 21 Second, the Investment Business department, another Bank department shrouded in secrecy, was headed by Novikov.

As the Bank’s witnesses explain, “the workings of the Investment Business were not known to Bank employees outside of the Investment Business and the Bank’s top management” (Luchaninov/¶16 {B1/3/6}), and (shortly after nationalisation) its offices were “... stripped of everything: the filing cabinets were completely empty and even the plug sockets had been removed from the wall. The majority of the staff in the Investment Business Department simply left after the nationalisation .... [Its] operation ... has been something of a ‘black box’ to me throughout my time at the Bank” (Pakhachuk/¶¶21-22 {B1/1/7}). Konstantin Medvedev, who provided a witness statement for D1 but who will not be attending trial to be cross-examined on it, was an employee of this department.  The Investment Business designed and implemented D1-2’s asset holding structures. 22 Third, the Budgeting Business was headed by Chmona and performed a treasury function  21  D1 and D2 refused to admit BOK’s existence in their original Defences, and only withdrew that non-admission in amendments made in mid-2022. See D1Def/¶12(4)(a) {A1/8/11}; D2Def/¶27(4) {A1/18/12}. \nAA2/1/19\n 14 in D1-2’s asset empire, including for significant industrial assets such as the ‘Ferroalloy Holding’ (see e.g. {K5-A1/11/3}). Luchaninov explains that its primary function “was to set budgets and cash-flow forecasts for [D1-2’s] businesses. Along with BOK, the purpose of the Budgeting Business was to keep [D1-2’s] businesses operating”: Luchaninov/¶18 {B1/3/6}.  23 In addition, reference will be made to the Corporate VIP Business department and the Cyprus branch: (1) Headed by Yatsenko, the Corporate VIP Business department provided banking services to the Bank’s large corporate clients: Luchaninov/¶15 {B1/3/5}. Given the pervasive influence of D1-2, many of them were D1-2’s companies. Importantly, the Corporate VIP Business department and its staff frequently assisted with the grant and concealment of lending to D1-2 entities. Olena Pogorelaya (a Bank witness) was an employee of this department. (2) The Cyprus branch, which had an office located in the same building as Primecap in Limassol and was headed by Vladyslav Morgachov, was another reclusive entity; for example, it refused to provide both Dmitry Luchaninov (the then head of the Bank’s compliance department and a Bank witness) and Ruslana Domashenko (the NBU Curator stationed at the Bank – again, a Bank witness) with transactional data, citing banking secrecy and data protection concerns: Luchaninov/¶¶46-51 {B1/3/12}; Domaschenko/¶35 {B1/14/10}. The Cyprus branch was used to service offshore companies controlled by D1-2. A 2016 investigation by the Central Bank of Cyprus concluded that there was a “serious and systemic” failure to implement anti-money laundering procedures at the branch {E12/292.1/2}, with an NBU inspection report dated 27.7.16 explaining that the branch was “fully dependent on the managerial decisions of the Bank’s Head Office” and a “vehicle serving the interests of a group of companies in which the Bank’s beneficial owners have an interest” {E15/28/18}. 24 Of the 50 Borrowers, the 47 Ukrainian Borrowers were ‘customers’ of Gurieva’s BOK (with BOK initiating the Relevant Loans to 46 of them).22 The remaining Relevant Loans, to the three Cypriot Borrowers who were ‘customers’ of the Cyprus branch, were initiated by Novikov’s Investment Business.

The ECC never met physically, instead carrying out votes electronically with no prior discussion and providing nothing more than a rubber-stamp to obviously improper lending. As explained in Section F1 (at ¶198ff) below, ECC approval was regularly given for loans worth tens of millions of dollars, within days or even on the same day as the loan application was made, without the material required for a genuine appraisal, and often with documents demonstrating the commercial absurdity of the lending. 26 The following is a simplified structure chart focusing on these key entities and individuals: \n 27 Finally, two ostensibly separate organisations were closely integrated with the Bank’s operations. They shared premises and worked hand in hand with Bank employees to arrange lending, payments and changes in the ownership structure of D1-2’s assets (including the companies involved in the Misappropriation), as explained in Sections C3 and C4 below.  28 PBC: Prydniprovsky Business Centre, formerly Privat Business Centre, was an organisation situated in the same building as the Investment Business. D1-2 were the true owners of PBC, which was used as a hub for establishing and administering their (usually Ukrainian) businesses. The most important PBC employee is Melnyk. He wears a number of hats, being (i) a senior employee of PBC, (ii) a purported beneficial owner of D3-5, (iii) a purported beneficial owner of 27 Borrowers, and (iv) an admitted D1-2 nominee who holds \nAA2/1/21\n 16 interests, pursuant to oral agreements,23 in 11 assets for D1 (which assets have a combined value of c. US$183m) and 19 assets for D2 (which assets have a combined value of c. US$116m).24 Other important PBC employees (and D1-2 nominees) are Iurii Pugach, Konstiantyn Ivlev, Anna Yesipova and Iryna Trykulych (all purported UBOs, with Melnyk, of D3-5). 29 Primecap: Primecap Cyprus Limited was an organisation housed in the same building as the Limassol office of the Bank’s Cyprus branch. It was owned and controlled at all times by D1-2. Novikov combined his role at the Bank with being one of the purported owners of Primecap and its “boss” (his email address was invboss@primecap.com.cy). Primecap was the Cypriot equivalent of PBC, typically used to administer D1-2’s offshore companies. B2 Events during 2013 - 2016 (1) 2013 - 2014: The Misappropriation 30 The key elements of the Misappropriation took place between 3.4.13 and 1.9.14. In particular: (i) the 134 Relevant Loans are dated between 3.4.13 and 21.8.14; (ii) the 270 Relevant Drawdowns were made between 1.11.13 and 1.9.14; (iii) the 54 Relevant Supply Agreements are dated between 14.5.14 and 21.8.14; and (iv) the 82 Unreturned Prepayments were made between 28.5.14 and 1.9.14. 31 The tracking and the cover-up of the Misappropriation also involved:  Until 1.9.14 The aggregate amount of the outstanding prepayments was tracked on a c. twice weekly basis by the Kazantsev Spreadsheet, 98 worksheets prepared by Kazantsev (e.g. {E7/39P}). The last worksheet shows US$1,911,877,385 in outstanding Unreturned Prepayments as at 1.9.14. Crucially, no prepayment was returned after 1.9.14.

It is presumably for this reason that the last of the worksheets also bears that date. September - November 2014 In order to disguise the Misappropriation, 46 of the Borrowers commenced Ukrainian court or arbitration proceedings against one of D3-8, complaining about their failure to supply goods under the RSAs (the “2014 Ukrainian Proceedings”). D3-8 accepted liability; judgments or awards were entered against them requiring the repayment of the sums they had received as prepayments (the “2014 Ukrainian Judgments” and “2015 Ukrainian Awards”).   23  In relation to Jodin Management Ltd {J2/4/6}, D1 does not specify the nature of the agreement. The Bank infers that it was an oral agreement, like all of D1’s other agreements with Melnyk. As for D2’s “oral agreements”, see ¶67. 24  Reply/Annex A {A1/26} and Annex B {A1/27}. \nAA2/1/22\n 17 This episode is a revealing example of the coordinated efforts of D1-2’s insiders at the Bank, PBC and Primecap: while PBC (Melnyk) was asking the Bank (Gurieva / Dubilet) to grant loans to cover the Borrowers’ fees for issuing the proceedings, which the Bank promptly did, PBC and Primecap procured D3-8 to sign letters admitting liability and asking to be excused from attending the relevant hearings. The 51 2014 Ukrainian Judgments are dated between 15.10.14 and 24.11.14; and the three 2015 Ukrainian Awards were entered between 27.2.15 and 7.4.15. No Borrower made any attempt to enforce them. They were no more than pieces of paper that could be shown to the regulator or auditor if they asked why the Unreturned Prepayments were outstanding and in order to avoid the Borrowers incurring punitive charges under Ukrainian foreign currency control regulations.  19.11.14 The latest version of the “Gurieva Spreadsheet” to which the Bank has access was produced. It contains details of 46 of the 50 Borrowers (those which made the Unreturned Prepayments); the amounts they had been lent by the Bank; the RSAs they had entered into with D3-8; the prepayments D3-8 had received; and the aggregate amount outstanding from D3-8 to the Borrowers: $1,911,877,385. (2) Late 2013 - 2015: Political turmoil, regulation, related-party lending and stress-testing 32 In late 2013, Ukraine experienced severe political turmoil: President Yanukovych’s refusal to sign the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement in November 2013 led to large-scale protests and, eventually, the February 2014 Revolution of Dignity; Russia invaded and subsequently annexed Crimea between February and March 2014: Rozhkova1/¶¶14-17 {B1/5/5}.  33 Ukraine turned to the IMF for help, and in due course entered into a US$17.1bn Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF in April 2014: Rozhkova1/¶18 {B1/5/5}. In return, the IMF required Ukraine to make significant reforms to its governance and economy, including its banking sector. At the same time, there was a liquidity crisis in the Bank. This led the Bank (through D2, as Chair of the Supervisory Board, and Dubilet) to seek massive bail-out loans from the NBU between March and July 2014. As D2 / Duiblet’s request for emergency funding to the NBU of 18.7.14 stated: “most borrowers are asking for extension of the loan debt repayment term” {E4/255}. What, of course they did not disclose was that these “borrowers” were D1-2’s own companies, which had used sham supply agreements and illusory security to extract the Relevant Drawdowns with no intention of genuine repayment. 34 The banking reforms required by the IMF, later enacted by the Ukrainian Parliament and the NBU, included: (1) Law 78 (28.12.14) “On mea"}

What, of course they did not disclose was that these “borrowers” were D1-2’s own companies, which had used sham supply agreements and illusory security to extract the Relevant Drawdowns with no intention of genuine repayment. 34 The banking reforms required by the IMF, later enacted by the Ukrainian Parliament and the NBU, included: (1) Law 78 (28.12.14) “On measures aimed at promoting the capitalisation and restructuring of banks”. It required (i) banks which failed to meet the required capital adequacy ratios \nAA2/1/23\n 18 to produce recapitalisation, restructuring and/or reorganisation plans, and (ii) (if those plans were not met) for the relevant bank to be placed into liquidation or nationalised: Beketov8/¶¶426-427, 438 {C1/1/145}; {C1/44} (Art. 1(1) -(3)). (2) Law 218-VIII (2.3.15) contained more detailed tests to be applied for assessing whether persons or legal entities were related to the bank in question: Rozhkova1/¶79 {B1/5/19} {E16/152/30} (Art. 52).  (3) Four NBU resolutions dated 15.4.15 (Resolution 260) and 12.5.15 (Resolutions 312, 314 and 315).25  35 The stress-test required by Resolution 260 assessed the Bank’s capital position as of 1.4.15. The NBU’s initial findings focused on the quality of the Bank’s assets and were released on 2.7.15 {E10/183} (the “Initial Report”) which estimated the Bank required additional capital of UAH 16bn. Following further investigation, the NBU’s final report of 11.12.15 concluded that additional capital of UAH 110.99 to UAH 113.11bn (c. US$4.75 - US$4.84bn) was required {E10/181} (the “Final Report”): Rozhkova1/¶130 {B1/5/31}. 36 In relation to related party lending, the Bank appointed Ernst & Young (“EY”) on 23.5.15 to prepare the report required by Resolution 314 {E17/242/7}. On 16.7.15, EY presented its 130-page report (the “EY Related Parties Report”) {E17/242} and found that the Bank’s N9 ratio was 89.5% – far in excess of the 25% required by Resolution 312.   37 Following receipt of EY’s report, the NBU wrote to the Bank to (i) note “inconsistencies” between the report and related-party lists previously filed by the Bank; and (ii) ask the Bank either to add 165 companies to its related-party lists or to provide evidence that they were unrelated {E10/266}. This led to considerable correspondence between the Bank and the NBU in which the Bank sought to persuade the NBU that the majority of the additional 165 borrowers were not, in fact, related. On 7.12.15, the NBU concluded, and conclusively certified, that 136 of the 165 borrowers – including 21 Borrowers and eight Intermediary  25  Briefly: (i) Resolution 260 {C1/106} required Ukraine’s largest 20 banks (including the Bank) to undergo stress-tests, and in the event that those tests showed undercapitalisation, for the relevant bank to prepare a recapitalisation or restructuring plan: Beketov8/¶431 {C1/1/147}; (ii) Resolution 312 amended the N9 related-party ratio applicable to Ukrainian banks, reducing it from 30% to 25%: Beketov8/¶450 {C1/1/153}. (N9 is the ratio of “(a) the aggregate amount of all claims of the bank against / all financial liabilities provided by the bank in relation to persons related to the bank, to (b) the regulatory capital of the bank”: Beketov8/¶450 {C1/1/153} (e.g. US$10 million related-party lending and US$100 million regulatory capital = 10%); (iii) Resolution 314 {E9/174} required banks to submit reports on active transactions with related parties and instruct an international audit firm to audit related party lending: Rozhkova1/¶86 {B1/5/21}; and (iv) Resolution 315 {C1/58/2} required banks to submit related party lists monthly and contained more detailed criteria for assessing relatedness: Rozhkova1/¶83 {B1/5/20}. \nAA2/1/24\n 19 Borrowers – were indeed related parties {E13/2}. 38 During this time of scrutiny, extensive efforts were made by Bank staff acting "}

These efforts were carried out by individuals in BOK, Investment Business and Corporate VIP Business, acting hand in hand with PBC and Primecap. By way of example only: 39 The Luchaninov Email {E8/163}. This email was sent by Luchaninov to Pikush, Yatsenko and Novikov on 31.3.15. It followed (i) an unplanned inspection by the NBU in relation to 42 of the Borrowers and (ii) a meeting at which Luchaninov was told to work out how D1-2’s connections with those Borrowers could be concealed: Luchaninov/¶¶52-54 {B1/3/13}. The body of the email states: “[c]onsidering that there is the risk of connections of lending operations to refinancing and persons related to the bank, the [attachments] provide suggestions on the removal of such connections”. Those attachments provided proposals for the resignation of a director or a member of a supervisory board of a particular company for the purpose of disguising the relatedness of 24 Borrowers {E8/164} {E8/165}. This manipulation of related-party status then appears to have been carried out for 22 of the 24 Borrowers: in three cases, by removing the related director of the Borrower; and in 19 cases, by removing the director of the Borrower from the supervisory board or as a director of the related D1-2 company.  40 The Rokoman Email {E10/264}, Rokoman Directors Spreadsheet {E10/279.2P}, Updated Rokoman Spreadsheet {E10/279.3P} and Beneficiary Key {E9/171P}. The Rokoman Email, dated 31.7.15 (i.e. shortly after the EY Related Parties Report was finalised), was sent by Rokoman (a senior BOK employee) to Gurieva (Head of BOK). It is headed “Suggestions for disaffiliating the affiliated counterparties” and states “... [a]t the first stage we suggest replacing directors with new ones, which will allow to significantly reduce concentrations across all groups, and 15 groups will be normalised. At the second stage beneficiary owners should be changed...”. The attachments show the detail of how these changes were to be made, including by “replac[ing] beneficiaries with 21 new ones and 6 existing ones”. The attachment proposing changes to the beneficiaries was produced in a cypher, so no purported beneficiaries were referred to by name (it referred to B1, B2 etc.). In due course, the purported beneficiaries of 13 offshore companies – all shareholders in the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers – were changed in accordance with Rokoman’s proposals. There was, of course, no genuine change in beneficial ownership – just changes to corporate records to conceal connections to D1-2.  41 Manipulation of NBU Related Party List. The Bank was required to submit lists of related parties to the NBU (from May 2015) on a monthly basis, which were reviewed by \nAA2/1/25\n 20 Dubilet prior to their finalisation and submission: Luchaninov/¶¶35, 41 {B1/3/9-10}. On 6.10.15, Dubilet commented on that month’s draft that “we need to reach the previously communicated figure of 43 bln + split record keeping for the companies determined under the new criteria …” {E17/202/4}. Dubilet’s instruction was thus for companies to be removed from the proposed related party list until the sum of the Bank’s lending to those parties fell below UAH 43bn: Luchaninov/¶¶43-44 {B1/3/11}.  42 The Avellum Emails.

Luchaninov was tasked with taking external legal advice about how to reduce the number of related parties. But Avellum, the law firm consulted, had no bright ideas. They advised on 8.10.15 that it was necessary to “discontinue any existing relations between the real beneficiary and nominal beneficiaries ...” and “sign a trust deed ... between the nominal beneficiaries and a new real beneficiary which should not be the Bank’s insider” (but that, of course, was unreal: no other genuine beneficiary would take over hundreds of companies with nothing but huge indebtedness) {E11/265}. Avellum added that “if the Bank is not able to provide a sufficient number of new beneficiaries to implement an ideal structure, it is possible to consider the acquisition of all [problem] companies by one or several beneficiaries on the same day” (ibid., original emphasis). (3) Late 2015-2016: The Restructuring Plan and Asset Transfer 43 By the end of 2015, the NBU’s Final Report had concluded that the Bank required recapitalisation in the amount of c. UAH 113bn (c. US$4.84bn).  This huge capital shortfall was largely attributable to (i) “loss-making operations of the majority of corporate borrowers” {E12/103.1/9}, which were unable to service their debts; (ii) the associated pervasive loan recycling and extension of payment terms to corporate borrowers (ibid.); and (iii) approximately 85% of corporate loans being secured by pledges over rights to receive goods, which did not appear capable of effective enforcement {E12/103.1/17-18}. According to Law 78 and Resolution 260, this required the Bank to submit a restructuring plan.  44 The Bank submitted a series of unsatisfactory proposals on and after 24.12.15: see {E12/138} and Rozhkova1/¶¶144-158 {B1/5/35}. After much debate, a more realistic plan was provided on 12.2.16 {E12/283} and approved by NBU Resolution 103/BT on 23.2.16 {E12/313} (the “Restructuring Plan”). It had three key facets: (i) by 1.4.16, the Bank would take 169 items of property worth UAH 31.1bn onto its balance sheet, with the 169 items being identified at Annex A {E12/283/33}; (ii) by 1.9.16, the Bank would take mortgages over a further 275 items of property worth UAH 76.7bn, with the 275 items being identified at Annex B {E12/283/36}; and (iii) the Bank would reduce loan provisions for “high concentration’ borrowers by procuring the repayment of the debts of 109 identified \nAA2/1/26\n 21 borrowers on a monthly basis. The borrowers (which include Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers) are listed in Annex E and the timetable for repayment of their debts specified in Annex F {E12/283/43-45} with UAH 13bn due to be repaid by the end of 2016 (see rows 1-23). 45 The Restructuring Plan was prepared with the full endorsement, and indeed substantial involvement, of D1-2: (i) it involved their express approval for the transfer of their own assets onto the Bank’s balance sheet (including hotels and office blocks which they admit to owning: see e.g. {A2/31.3} {A2/31.4/10}); (ii) prior iterations of the plan were approved at Supervisory Board meetings held on 29.1.16 and 4.2.16 (with D1-2 voting in favour) {K1/133} {K1/134}; and (iii) the Restructuring Plan itself was approved by the Supervisory Board on 12.2.16 (with D1-2 again voting in favour) {K1/135}. On each occasion, the draft/final plan was exhibited to the Supervisory Board minutes. 46 However, the Bank’s efforts to comply with the Restructuring Plan were desultory: (i) action was only taken when the NBU complained; and (ii) the NBU was regularly deceived about what assets had been transferred and what they were worth: Rozhkova1/¶166-188"}

The ‘Asset Transfer’ part of the Restructuring Plan, by which certain assets were transferred to the Bank, is discussed in detail in Section H2 below.  (4) Late 2016: The Transformation and the New Loans 47 The Bank’s failure to comply with its own Restructuring Plan meant that it breached the requirement of Law 78 and Resolution 260 to achieve a capital adequacy ratio of 5% or more by 1.10.16 (a deadline repeatedly extended to allow the Bank to recapitalise): Beketov8/¶432 {C1/1/147}. That meant the Bank faced liquidation or nationalisation.  48 By letters signed in late September/early October 2016 {B3/4/34} {B3/4/32}, and in an attempt to stave off the prospect of an insolvent nationalisation, D1-2 offered a number of ‘guarantees’. They included (ibid., emphasis supplied):  “... (2) Restructuring of corporate credit portfolio based on market conditions by transferring the existing loans to operating companies, whose sources of income are real and transparent, clearly defining the repayment dates for such loans and ensuring quality maintenance of the loans. (3) Registering collateral for the said loans at the market value and according to the requirements of the applicable law.” 49 The NBU was prepared to give the Bank a final opportunity to recapitalise. It resolved, by Decision 323/rsh-BT of 5.10.16 {E15/303}, to (i) consider a proposal, to be submitted by 12.10.16, for a loan transformation as outlined by D1-2, involving the transfer of “existing loans” made to the “193 Borrowers” (which included 43 of the Borrowers) “to operating companies that have real and transparent sources of income” and the provision of proper collateral \nAA2/1/27\n 22 (the “Transformation”), and (ii) require an auditor to update the Bank’s stress test and verify its capital adequacy levels by 15.11.16 (EY were again appointed). In the event: (1) The Bank did not provide the NBU with any such proposal by 12.10.16. (2) On 17.10.16, the NBU sent a team, headed by Mykhailo Shekmar (a Bank witness), to perform an unscheduled inspection of the Bank (the “Unscheduled Inspection”): Shekmar/¶¶39-41 {B1/12/12}. (3) A transformation plan was submitted to the NBU on 20.10.16 {E16/28}, but it was promptly amended by letters dated 3, 4, 15 and 23.11.16. Remarkably, implementation of the plan commenced on 20.10.16 (i.e. the same day as it was first provided to the NBU), presumably so that the NBU could not assess the proposals and point out their obvious defects: Rozhkova1/¶¶234-239 {B1/5/57}. (4) Unsurprisingly, Shekmar’s team within days identified serious issues including as to the solvency and cash flow of the replacement borrowers involved in the Transformation (the “New Borrowers”) {E16/65}. (5) A final version of the transformation plan was submitted on 21.11.16 {E16/205} (the “Transformation Plan”). This was the day after the last of the loans to the New Borrowers (the “New Loans”) had been issued and the Transformation was effectively complete: Rozhkova1/¶237 {B1/5/58}. (6) The Transformation Plan was thus presented to the NBU as a fait accompli. It amounted to little more than transferring loans owed by the 193 Borrowers (including the Borrowers) to the 36 New Borrowers. The New Borrowers (who, as explained below, were also owned and/or controlled by D1-2) had no creditworthiness and were not “operating companies” with “real and transparent” sources of income.

The New Loans provided for the vast majority of the UAH 127bn in lending to be repaid in 2024-25. Similarly, the collateral for the New Loans consisted of worthless pledges over supply agreements that would never be performed, and so was plainly inadequate and non-compliant with NBU requirements.26 50 Meanwhile (i) the Share Pledges (see Section F, ¶250ff.) – purported pledges over shares in  26  This was under both NBU Regulation 23 and the newer Regulation 351 (approved on 30.6.16 and to come into force on 3.1.17). Regulation 351 replaced Regulation 23 (dated 25.1.12) which permitted security over contractual rights provided that there was documentary evidence to show that they would be performed. Resolution 351 provided that pledges over contractual rights would not under any circumstances constitute good security for the purposes of calculating a bank’s capital adequacy and Decision 323/rsh-BT expressly provided that any collateral needed to comply with the new regulation: Rozhkova1/¶247-521 {B1/5/60-61}.  \nAA2/1/28\n 23 D1-2’s companies that had been provided as security for the Relevant Loans – were cancelled en masse in October / November 2016 (while draft replacements, which would have provided purported security for the New Loans, were left in abeyance); and (ii) EY were told by the Bank that, although the New Borrowers were shell companies with no assets, they were expected to “take over the business from other companies (the ‘donor companies’) owned by the ultimate beneficiaries of the new borrowers” {E16/179/100}. Those businesses included Ukrnafta, Ukrtatnafta, NFP, OGOK, ZFP and Dniproazot, all of which are admitted D1-2 assets. Of course, the posited acquisition by the New Borrowers of D1-2’s genuinely valuable industrial assets’ businesses and revenue streams never happened. (5) December 2016: Nationalisation 51 The Transformation Plan having been carried out in an obviously improper manner, nationalisation was inevitable. Indeed: (i) EY concluded on 22.11.16 that the Bank required additional regulatory capital of between UAH 138.9bn and UAH 146.4bn (c. US$5.43 to 5.72bn) {E16/179/124}; (ii) NBU Resolution 105 dated 13.12.16 certified that 1,092 corporate borrowers were related parties {E17/36}; and (iii) the Bank had started to lose liquidity in late November 2016 and to postpone client payments in December 2016: Rozhkova1/¶275 {B1/5/65}. 52 In stark contrast to D1’s (now seemingly abandoned) claim that nationalisation was politically motivated, D1-2 themselves wrote to the Ukrainian Prime Minister on 16.12.16 seeking the nationalisation of the Bank {E17/42}. This step appears to have been motivated by a desire to avoid prosecution: Rozhkova1/¶276 {B1/5/65-66}. 53 The decision to nationalise the Bank was taken at about 9pm on Sunday 18.12.16, at the offices of the Ukrainian President. It was made all the more urgent by recent transactional activity showing suspicious transfers of funds and further failures to service payments. Further decisions were taken that day and on Monday 19.12.16 by the NBU and the Deposit Guarantee Fund: Rozhkova1/¶¶277-278 {B1/5/66}. 54 The decision to nationalise received strong support from the international community: it was praised by Vice President Joe Biden, Chancellor Angela Merkel, Christine Lagarde (head of the IMF), the European Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the related bail-in was recognised by the Bank of England.

C1 D1 and D2 (1) Mr Kolomoisky 56 D1 is a 60-year-old Ukrainian, Israeli and Cypriot national. He and D2 established the Bank in 1992, with the D1-2 business empire growing later that decade. D1 lived in Ukraine until about 2003, when he moved to spend time in France, Israel and Switzerland. In 2010, he became a Swiss resident, based in Geneva, and working at offices operated by Cad Cool SA, a private office company run by his sister (though D1-2 later established a joint office in Geneva: see ¶182 below). In May 2019, he moved back to Ukraine. 57 D1 has residences in Dnipro and Kyiv {A4/22/12-13} (¶¶2.5.2-2.5.6). Although he said through his solicitor at the 2022 PTR that he intended to stay in Ukraine for patriotic reasons, there is no evidence that he has supported the war effort (reports that D1 has been stripped of his citizenship {PTR2-B2/2/3} (¶10) tend to suggest that he has not).  58 D1 eschews conventional means of communication and record keeping. He states that he does not use email (believing it to be unsafe and unreliable) {A4/22/12} (¶2.3.1); restricts the volume of documents he creates, promptly disposing of any hard copy documents {A4/22/10} (¶¶2.1.4, 2.4.1); and uses a secure telephone network to communicate with his inner circle known as ‘the Black’, in respect of which he claims to have no records {H2/56/7} (¶13.1). He also relies on others to carry out his instructions, including Novikov and Primecap, Melnyk and PBC, and a select group of Cypriot corporate service providers (“CSPs”) and lawyers.  59 D1 makes heavy use of WhatsApp and Viber {A4/22/12} (¶2.3.3). Notwithstanding his general policy of document destruction, D1 has eventually – after a series of Court orders – given disclosure of some (demonstrably incomplete) instant messages from 2015-16, and a large number of messages from 2017 onwards. However, he has disclosed no instant messages whatsoever from 2013 or 2014 when the Misappropriation took place. (2) Mr Bogolyubov 60 D2 is a 61-year-old Ukrainian, British, Israeli and Cypriot national: {A1/18/3} (¶8). D2 left Ukraine in 2007, settling in London in 2009 and living there (at 31 Belgrave Square) for almost a decade with his second wife and children. He speaks and writes English fluently. In 2017, D2 relocated to Geneva in an attempt to avoid further litigation being brought \nAA2/1/30\n 25 against him and his business associates in the English courts {I3/20/7} (¶¶26-29) and paid his wife (from whom he was separated) £7m to do likewise, apparently with the encouragement of D2’s “business partners” (sc. D1) {I3/60/9-10} (¶¶54-55). Like D1, D2 moved back to Ukraine in around 2019. D2 said at the March 2022 adjournment hearing that he was living near Lviv, and unable and unwilling to leave Ukraine.27 However, after the adjournment, D2 has travelled in and out of Ukraine (where, as of December 2022, he was said to be living).28  61 D2 says that documents have been “destroyed or disposed of from time to time in the ordinary course of business” {A4/32/5} (¶9) and that he “did not use any document management systems, email servers, cloud based data storage [or] backup systems” {A4/32/8} (¶16). A key difference between him and D1 is that"}

A key difference between him and D1 is that D2 did use Gmail and a limited number of emails sent from/to his Gmail accounts are available to the Court (following extensive efforts taken by the Bank: see ¶184 below). 62 Like D1, D2 relied on his trusted agents to administer his affairs, keep records and/or hold his assets for him, usually on the basis of oral agreements. These included the agents used by D1 (in particular: Novikov, PBC, Primecap, and the Cypriot CSPs), as well as D2’s own long-standing personal assistant, Vyacheslav (‘Slava’) Anischenko (see ¶78ff below). (3) D1-2’s joint business empire and close relationship 63 Friends and business partners. D1-2 are close friends, have been business partners for over thirty years, and hold the vast majority of their assets together. D1-2’s pleadings and witness statements in English proceedings brought against them by Victor Pinchuk (the “Pinchuk Proceedings”), describes their relationship as follows: D1: “I first met [D2] in April 1990. We have since become close friends and have also worked closely together in business. ...” {I3/11/3} (¶13)  D2: “It is not disputed that the Defendants … would describe themselves as ‘business partners’ …” {I3/4/3} (¶9) D2: “[D1] and I first went into business together shortly after meeting in the early 1990s and we have since worked together on many projects and investments. We quickly became close friends. We frequently socialise together and often go on vacations together with our families. [D1] and I have invested in many businesses together over the years, and we continue to cooperate very closely in relation to certain of our investments. …” {I3/13/3} (¶¶8-9)  D1: “… I could see that [D2] was about to reply angrily to Mr Pinchuk, so I kicked him on the leg to stop him from saying anything. I said, addressing Mr Pinchuk, that if there was a unanimous decision that KZhRK should be bought by us (meaning, [D2] and me), then we would buy it.” {I3/11/27} (¶92)  27  Maling11/¶29 {H3/14/8}, Elliss3/¶3(a) {H3/17/2}. 28  Enyo (13.12.22) {L/115}; Enyo (5.1.23) {L/118}. \nAA2/1/31\n 26 D2: “The idea that [D1] would have agreed to transfer the KZhRK shares to Mr Pinchuk, or declared that he was doing so, is unreal. In the first place, [D1] would have told me had he said anything of the sort; it was [D1’s] practice to update me on any material developments affecting KZhRK. [D1] never mentioned that he reached any sort of agreement or made any declaration conceding that our shares in KZhRK were held by us on behalf of Mr Pinchuk. ...” {I3/13/43} (¶95) 64 Their close relationship has been evident in their conduct of these proceedings. For example: (i) D2 outsourced the Primecap disclosure exercise to D1 and has recently said that he is willing to pay £6m to D1’s solicitors “in respect of work attributable to both [D1] and [D2] … Although there was no express agreement, [D2] believes that he has an obligation to pay his share towards costs that were incurred on his behalf. …” {L/150.1}; (ii) D2 has sought the Bank’s consent to lend €9.8m to D1 to pay D1’s legal fees (albeit that request was advanced on the demonstrably false basis that D1 was not able to pay his legal fees from other sources) {L/137.1}; and (iii) D2 has been content to rely on D1’s pleadings as to his own interests in various assets, including D2’s interests in the Transferred Assets and the Share Pledge companies. Indeed, D1 is represented in these proceedings by the same lead advocate who represented D2 in the Pinchuk Proceedings. 65 Joi"}

Indeed, D1 is represented in these proceedings by the same lead advocate who represented D2 in the Pinchuk Proceedings. 65 Joint assets. By 2018, when D1-2 gave their WFO asset disclosure (the “2018 Asset Disclosure”), they disclosed assets which they valued at US$5bn. The great majority by value are owned jointly. By way of illustration, D1-2’s five most valuable assets are: Disclosed asset D1-2 valuation 50% stake in the ‘Ferroalloy Holding’ US$1.25bn29 KZhRK Receivable (proceeds of the purported sale of KZhRK) c. US$1bn30 c. 80% holding in the Georgian American Alloys group c. US$820m31 c. 35% stake in the ‘Oil Transhipment Holding’ US$414m32 c. 13.5% stake in the Ukrainian oil and gas company Ukrtatnafta c. US$282m33 66 Both D1’s and D2’s asset disclosure is replete with complicated (or, as the Court has held, “byzantine” {A5/26/9}) ownership structures, involving several levels of offshore corporate entities and frequently ending in an “oral agreement” between D1-2 and their nominees, suggesting a high degree of trust on the part of D1-2 in those individuals. 67 Indeed, D2’s position is even worse: as the Court will recall from the 23.5.23 hearing, D2 (i)  29  D1 U/R, Assets 1-5 {J2/3/1-14}; D2 U/R, Assets 130-134 {J4/5/144-148}. 30  D1 U/R, Asset 112 {J2/3/121}; D2 U/R, Asset 5 {J4/5/2} (D1’s valuation is set out in the table).  31  D1 Non-U/R {J1/3/5}; D2 Non-U/R, Asset 54 {J3/4/18}.  32  D1 U/R, Assets 50-60 {J2/3/57-92}; D2 U/R, Assets 66-77 {J4/5/59-96}. 33  D1 U/R, Asset 61 {J2/3/92}; D2 U/R, Asset 3 {J4/5/2}. \nAA2/1/32\n 27 said, in January 2018, that three assets were held for him pursuant to “oral agreements” (e.g. {J4/3/42}), (ii) then said, in June 2019, that 109 assets, worth almost US$500m, were held for him pursuant to “oral agreements” {DD-1A/4/1-7}, (iii) then said, in February 2023, that he had not entered into any of those oral agreements personally, but through unidentified agents, and that he did not even know the names of his nominees before this litigation started {H3/23/2} (¶7), and (iv) has most recently said that there were no oral agreements at all, but merely “arrangements” which arose by “conduct and implication” {DD-1A/11/13} (¶6). On 23.5.23, the Court observed that “it really does … defy belief” that D2 claimed to be unable to get information necessary “to protect his own assets”; and D2 was ordered to provide further details of his most recent explanation. For economy, references to “oral agreements” below include unwritten arrangements now said to have been by conduct/implication. 68 Critically for the purpose of this case, the concealment and the deniability created by “oral agreements” has unravelled: D1-2 have also been forced to admit holding interests in 18 of the same Borrowers,34 10 of the same Intermediary Borrowers35 and 22 of the pledgor companies under the Share Pledges.36 The reality is that they had no option but to acknowledge their interest in these particular companies: see further ¶313 below. 69 Communications. To run their joint businesses, D1-2 needed to communicate regularly. Much of this is not documented: see above. Nonetheless, it is possible to infer the true nature of D1-2’s relationship from their belated and compelled disclosure of WhatsApp messages, including 2,434 messages D1-2 exchanged between 4.7.17 and 26.5.21, together with 928 attachments (624 messages and 238 attachments per year). They show that: (1) There is and was an extremely close personal relationship between the two men.

D1-2 communicate very informally, sharing jokes37 and often bawdy memes,38 political commentary/satire,39 and even health and reading recommendations.40  (2) D2 frequently permitted D1 to act on his behalf in relation to their joint assets or businesses. By way of example, during 2018 - 2019, D1 received near daily updates  34  AEF, Agroprom, Alfatrader, Cambel, Dorteks, Empire, Favore, Foxar, Gardera, Milorin, Ortika, Prado, Prominmet, Ribotto, Rudnex, Tekhspetmontazh, Uniks, Vialint: D1 RRFI {A2/30.1}, D2 RRFI {A2/33}, D2 RRFI {A2/37}. 35  Autotradeinvest, Amandoras, Centrostal, Letara, Mialis, Mitsar, Stimeks, Tinto, Vikor M and Vinibur: D1Def/Sch. 7 {A1/17.1} and Schedule to D2 RRFI {A2/39.4}.  36  D1Def/Sch. 6 {A1/17}, adopted by D2: see Enyo (22.6.22, 2nd) {L/76.1}, Hogan Lovells (6.7.22) {L/82} and Enyo (2.8.22, 2nd) {L/85}. 37  Examples are found at: {K5-A2/3/7}, {K5-A2/3/32}, {K5-A2/3/99}. 38  See {K5-A2/3/26}, {K5-A2/3/42} and{K5-A2/6/9}. 39  Examples are found at: {K5-A2/3/6}, {K5-A2/3/27}, {K5-A2/3/38} and {K5-A2/3/96}. 40  See {K5-A2/3/97} and {K5-A2/3/10}.  \nAA2/1/33\n 28 from a former bank employee, Marina Markova, as to the balances of at least 20 bank accounts maintained by various companies and individuals: {K5-A1/39} {K5-A1/40}. Importantly, D1 was provided with information in relation to: (i) three companies in which D1-2 have both disclosed an interest (Goiania, Stalmag and Unimain); (ii) three companies in which only D2 has disclosed an interest (Grizal, Libera and Transit); and (iii) two of D2’s personal bank accounts (Euro and Dollar accounts held with PrivatBank Latvia). (3) D1-2 cooperated closely in the aftermath of the Bank’s nationalisation, including by sharing leaked and confidential material with each other. For example, in a series of WhatsApp messages in late 2017, D1 sent D2 documents or information related to D1’s attempts to thwart the Bank bringing these claims: (i) on 2.12.17, D1 provided D2 with the text of a draft injunction that he was going to seek against Hogan Lovells a matter of weeks before this claim was brought {K5-A2/3/16} {K5-C1/28}; (ii) on 7.12.17, D1 provided D2 with a court order obtained by the Ukrainian General Prosecutor authorising a search of the Bank’s premises, together with a list of the locations of important Bank personnel (e.g. its CEO and security staff) {K5-A2/3/17} {K5-C1/29} {K5-C1/30}; and (iii) when D1 was seeking information about the Bank’s (confidential and privileged) decision to authorise this claim on 19.12.17, D2 anxiously chased him for updates (“What are they saying?”, “Why aren’t you calling?”) {K5-A2/3/19}. (4) In a further series of WhatsApp messages in late 2019, D1 updated D2 on his attempts to pressurise the NBU to abandon its banking reforms. D2, in turn, encouraged D1’s conduct and provided him with advice. Specifically: (a) Between 25.11.19 and 16.12.19, D1 sent D2 30 photographs and 26 videos of protests taking place outside the NBU: {K5-A2/6/31-45}. Many show banners being waved which say things like “Smoliy [sc., the NBU’s then Governor] and Rozhkova – criminals!” and “Smoliy and Rozhkova are the Bonnie and Clyde of the Ukrainian financial system”. (b) 15 of the photographs were sent on 16.12.19 alone, with one showing a coffin and wreaths {K5-A2/6/45} and four showing demonstrations in residential areas {K5-A2/6/44}. They were sent minutes after D2 sent D1 a link to an article reporting that demonstrations outside the NBU had been taking place for a month and had, in the NBU’s opinion, been paid for by \nAA2/1/34\n 29 former owners of nationalised banks – "}

(c) D1 messaged D2 at 13:27 on 16.12.19, having sent nine of the 15 photographs, saying “We’re working!” {K5-A2/6/43}. (d) At 14:08 and 14:37 that day, D2 sent D1 links to press articles which stated (i) “[i]n the event that the law on the functioning of the banking system … comes into force, [D1] will not be able to get the bank back” and (ii) “PrivatBank is being prepared for bankruptcy because of Kolomoisky’s trials” {K5-A2/6/45}. A minute after sending the second article, D2 said: “And it is important to pass the law before the court decision” {K5-A2/6/46}. 70 Litigation. D1-2 have been involved in litigation about aspects of their business empire, often in this jurisdiction and usually as co-defendants, for over a decade. This includes: Date Proceedings 2009 - 2011 The US Felman Proceedings 2013 - 2014 The JKX Proceedings (HC1302145HC) 2014 - January 2016 The Pinchuk Proceedings (Claim No. 2014 Folio 354) March 2016 - 2021 The Tatneft Proceedings (CL-2016-000172) 2017 The Shulman Proceedings (HC2017-001383) 2017 - 2023 The instant proceedings, though the Bank has also brought other claims against D1-2 in Delaware, Israel and Cyprus Since April 2019 FBI investigation into D1-2’s steel and mining interests in the US and Africa. Since August 2020 Four US Department of Justice civil money laundering / forfeiture complaints in the US District Court for Southern District of Florida. 71 These proceedings are significant for three main reasons: (i) they resulted in D1-2 or their representatives making relevant witness statements (e.g. Novikov’s 48-page statement in the Pinchuk Proceedings); (ii) there have been some important judicial findings (e.g. Mann J’s observation in the JKX Proceedings that Novikov is D1’s “right hand man”); and (iii) they provide the context against which D1-2’s disclosure in this case falls to be judged: D1-2 were required to preserve documents (such as instant messages) for the period 2013-15; but appear to have taken advantage of the small window between the conclusion of the Pinchuk Proceedings and the commencement of the Tatneft Proceedings to dispose of them, as \nAA2/1/35\n 30 explained in ¶178 below. C2 D1-2’s trusted lieutenants 72 In order to run their sprawling empire, D1-2 relied on key trusted lieutenants. In particular: (1) Novikov: First Deputy Chair of the Bank’s Management Board, head of its Investment Business, and de facto managing director of Primecap. (2) Dubilet: Chair of the Management Board and the ECC, who signed 115 of the Relevant Loan agreements on behalf of the Bank.  (3) Gurieva: Deputy Chair of the Management Board and Head of BOK, the department which originated the loans to 46 of the Borrowers.  (4) Chmona: Deputy Chair of the Management Board and Head of the Budgeting Business, who provided D1-2 with detailed financial information about their assets.  (5) Anischenko: D2’s personal assistant, administrator of his assets, and head of his private office, whom D2 entrusted with keeping track of his asset holdings and making trust and other arrangements on his behalf.  (1) Novikov 73 Novikov has exceptionally close ties to D1-2. As for his relationship with D1, Mann J described Novikov as D1’s “right hand man” in the JKX Proceedings.41 Furthermore, in the Pinchuk Proceedings, D1 accepted in his Defence that Novikov had, as early as 2004-2006, acted as his ‘representative’ an"}

I would say that my role throughout the period relevant to these proceedings was that of a subordinate required to act on the instructions of [D1] and/or [D2]; my role was not that of a business partner or equal. … I mainly liaised with, and received instructions from, [D1] as he was more involved in the various corporate matters than [D2]. … Instructions were mainly communicated over the phone, by text message or in person. We never corresponded by email.” {I3/12/3}(¶¶9-10) Novikov: “My primary role in the formation of the Ferroalloy Holding was operational in nature. I devised and implemented the corporate structure, negotiated … the terms of the various legal documents necessary to form the structure, … and generally ensured that [D1’s]  41  [2013] EWHC 2631 (Ch) at [13], [30] {I3/3/8}.  42  D1’s Defence in the Pinchuk Proceedings {I3/5/1}, ¶¶50(e)(iii), 50(f)(iii), 73(c), 74(j). \nAA2/1/36\n 31 instructions were reflected in the documentation” {I3/12/38} (¶136)43 D1: “In the course of August 2004, I learned from Mr Novikov that Mr Pinchuk’s companies had placed two large deposits with PrivatBank ....” {I3/11/29} (¶97)  Koltyarenko (a Bank and later Primecap employee): “I received instructions directly from Mr Timur Novikov, who has a close working relationship with both Defendants. I have known Mr Novikov for many years and have a close personal and working relationship with him. However, I was not privy to the details of his discussions with either of the Defendants. Information was only relayed to me if it was deemed necessary in order for me to progress my work.” {I3/16/2} (¶¶6-7) 74 Novikov and D1 exchanged 1,471 WhatsApp messages (plus 345 attachments) between 2.2.17 to 30.9.17 and 22.12.17 to 15.1.19, an average of over two a day. They reveal that: (1) D1 and Novikov were clearly friends: (i) they congratulate each other on their birthdays, New Year and other holidays;44 (ii) they exchange jokes and political satire;45 and (iii) Novikov is happy asking D1 for the occasional favour (e.g. “Can I pick up my parents from Dnipro on an airplane that is with me now? …”).46 (2) Novikov was involved in all aspects of D1’s business and also managed the structures by which D1’s assets were held (including assets held jointly with D2).  (3) Novikov’s role was extremely wide-ranging: around 290 messages have been redacted because they are said to reveal details of confidential and irrelevant “business projects”, “commercial interests” or similar.  (4) Novikov provided direct assistance in these proceedings. For example:  (a) On 4.5.17, Novikov provided information to D1 about a letter recently received by the Bank from the NBU, together with minutes of an NBU meeting reflecting a decision to pursue the guarantors of the Bank’s NBU refinancing loans (i.e. D1-2) in Court, and to conduct further investigations at the Cyprus branch {K5-A1/47/9}, {K5-B12/12} and {K5-B12/13}. Novikov then included a “Quote”, presumably from his source within the Bank, that stated “we are fucked” (ibid.); and he shared information on steps taken by Galyna Pakhachuk, then a member of the Bank’s Management Board (and a Bank witness) with respect to the Bank’s deposits an"}

(c) On 7.2.18, Novikov asked D1 whether he should send him an NBU inspection report regarding the Bank, and D1 responded “yes”. Novikov also offered to send the report to D2 and Dubilet {K5-A1/50/17-18}. The report (by the NBU team led by Shekmar, a Bank witness) is dated 30.1.18, labelled as subject to banking secrecy law (i.e. confidential to the Bank and the NBU) and addresses (inter alia) transactions executed immediately before nationalisation for the apparent benefit of D1-2 {K5-B12/102}. (d) In total, Novikov and D1 exchanged over 130 messages during the return date hearing (redacted on privilege grounds) {K5-A1/50/69-70}. Indeed, D1 has disclosed a copy of the Gurieva Spreadsheet of which Novikov is identified as the custodian. The metadata shows that it was “last modified” by Novikov on Sat. 28.7.18, the day after the Bank’s counsel first showed the Court a copy of the Gurieva Spreadsheet on Fri. 27.7.18 {E18/235.4M}. 75 Novikov and D2 exchanged 849 WhatsApp messages between 26.4.18 and 20.5.21, an average of 280 a year, together with 119 attachments. They show that: (1) D2 and Novikov are also clearly friends. For example: (i) on 21.1.13 D2 sent Novikov a picture of Novikov and his wife on holiday with the subject line “one year ago” (to which Novikov responds “Unforgettable experience. Thank you! Be happy!” {E1/239.1}, {E1/239.2.1}); (ii) D2 sent Novikov a video invitation to his birthday in Israel in 2019,47 invited Novikov to a gala dinner to celebrate his birthday in 2020, and they wished each other a happy birthday the next year;48 (iii) the two men shared jokes;49 and (iv) D2 gave Novikov tips on the latest technology.50 (2) Novikov provided D2 with updates on transfers, payments and bank balances (or  47  The video is found at {K5-C5/9L}. Counsel for D2 previously suggested that the fact there was “no birthday message in 2019 … does seem to suggest there must have been a fracture in the relationship…” {G3/41/50} (p.196:1-2).

However, D2’s sporadic disclosure of emails and telephone records show a long-standing relationship. For example:  (1) 27.10.11: Novikov emailed D2 with details of D2’s investment in Hotel Split in Croatia {E1/116/1} {E1/116.1}. Later, in March 2013 and May 2015, Novikov corresponded with D2 about refinancing the hotel’s debts with Sberbank and with one of D2’s business associates about the hotel’s potential sale: {E1/266.1}, {E10/34.1} and {E9/214.2}.  (2) 21.2.13: Novikov explained to D2 that over UAH 1.2bn (c. US$150m) had been “withdrawn from the deposit accounts of PBC companies” in December 2012 for “KSW  51  See {K5-A2/15/3}; {K5-A2/15/4}; {K5-A2/15/6}; {K5-A2/15/8}; {K5-A2/15/19}; {K5-A2/15/20}; {K5-A2/15/24}. 52  For example: {K5-A2/15/4}, {K5-C5/2}; {K5-A2/15/7}. 53 {K5-A2/15/55}, {K5-A2/15/57}, {K5-A2/15/58-59} and {K5-A2/15/68}. 54  {K5-A2/15/62}. The attached document {K5-C5/21} makes it clear that this request related to the Bank.  \nAA2/1/39\n 34 Liabilities” {E1/254.1/1}.55 Later, on 13.3.13, Novikov sent an email to D2 briefing him on a problem with a real estate investment in Kharkiv. He asked D2 whether five companies – including two Borrowers (Dorteks and Uniks) and one Intermediary Borrower (Floreks-Indastriz) – should seek to renew leases of land: the local council had indicated it would not renew the leases and one company’s lease had been terminated by court decision. D2’s brief response was “we won’t fight”. Importantly, Novikov explained that the five entities were “PBC companies” {E1/273}. The significance of D2’s knowledge of PBC’s role is addressed in ¶¶82 -  92 below.   (3) Between 8.2.14 and 30.5.14, D2’s disclosed call records (which do not include WhatsApp calls or conversations on ‘the Black’) demonstrate he and Novikov spoke regularly by telephone.56 (4) 1.7.16: Novikov arranged, via Anischenko, for D2’s signature on a letter to the Bank’s auditors, confirming the completeness of related party lists for the Bank’s 2015 accounts.57  (2) Dubilet, Gurieva and Chmona 77 In order to exercise control over the Bank, D1-2 made use of Novikov, and also a series of other key senior Bank executives – in particular, Dubilet, Gurieva and Chmona.

D1-2’s use of these executives, and the adverse inferences to be drawn in respect of D1-2’s failure to adduce evidence from them, is addressed in Sections D and E below. (3) Anischenko 78 In the Shulman Proceedings, D2 described Anischenko as “the person who assists me in relation to my personal arrangements and finances” and “responsible for running my private office” {I3/22/23, 35} (¶¶56(c)(ii), 68). Anischenko’s own evidence explained that he: (i) worked for the Bank between 2000-08 and came to know D2 as a result; (ii) was recruited by D2 in early 2008 and moved with him to London in September 2008; (iii) moved with D2 to Geneva in April 2017; and (iv) sees D2 “almost every day”  when the two men are in Geneva {I1/23} (¶¶3, 9). 79 Anischenko exchanged 157 messages with Novikov between 21.6.17 and 18.1.22 and D2,  55  ‘KSW’ refers to PJSC Kremenchug Steel Works, of which D1-2 were the UBOs in 2017 {K3-A6/130.1}. 56  {K5-E/4}, {K5-E/5}, {K5-E/6} and {K5-E/7} (Novikov’s phone numbers are +44754077807, +41792002618 and +41794831582). D2 also disclosed call records related to a particular mobile number from 10.12.16 to 26.1.17, which show that D2 spoke with Novikov on 10.12.16 and 17.1.17 {K5-E/8/2}.  57  {E14/264}. Novikov also emailed D2 directly to procure his signature of a similar letter for the first three quarters of 2012 on 24.12.12 {E1/229}, and Anischenko appears again to have provided Novikov with a similar letter signed by D2 for 2014 on 13.5.15 {E9/195.1}, {E9/195.2/3}. \nAA2/1/40\n 35 Novikov and Anischenko exchanged a number of emails relating to personal and business matters. Anischenko moved to Geneva in 2016 in order to continue his work as D2’s “personal assistant” {H3/3/8}; WhatsApp messages show Novikov joined them there.58  80 The role performed by Anischenko for D2 included: (1) Managing assets for D2. The WhatsApps show Anischenko managing D2’s bank accounts, private jet and various other assets: e.g. {DAD-A/1/14}. See also Novikov’s email to Anischenko of 29.1.16, asking for his comments on a list of D2’s “Real Estate Projects”: {E12/215}, {E12/216}.  (2) Maintaining asset lists for D2. Anischenko produced assets lists for D2’s (and D1’s) assets in 2007 and 2008, fragments of which are available to the Court: {E1/11P}; {E1/12P}; {E18/173P}. (3) Operating D2’s ‘trusts’. D2 made extensive use of purported offshore trusts to hold his assets, including in many cases his share of assets held jointly with D1. D2 settled at least 74 holding companies into at least 25 purported Jersey discretionary trusts around March 2009.59 They included interests in the valuable ‘Ferroalloy Holding’, Ukrnafta, Eclairs Group, GM Georgian Manganese and the ‘Optima’ companies. But D2 continued to control the assets in the trusts, via (inter alios) Anischenko. Indeed, when some of the trusts were re-domiciled to Cyprus in late 2015, Anischenko administered the move (describing D2 as his “CEO” {E12/53/4}); and, from March 2016 onwards, he procured the transfer of assets out of the trusts to the Bank as part of the Asset Transfer (e.g. {E13/206} {E13/253} {E13/289}). See further Schedule 9. 81 D2 has not tendered Anischenko as a witness and has not disclosed a single written communication with him from his own devices between 2013 and 2016.60 Again, the adverse inferences to be drawn are addressed in Section E below.   58  On 19.6.18, Novikov asked D2 “Can you tell me if you will be in the office soon?”, and D2 responded “15 minutes” {K5-A2/15/5}; on 15.1.19, Novikov messaged Anischenko and suggested that they meet “in the office” to discuss his upcoming trip to Israel {K5-A3/13/30}; on 25.2.20, Anischenko messaged Novikov saying “Timur, s"}

Its offices were in the same building in Dnipro as the Investment Business.61 PBC’s employees were intimately involved in the affairs of D1-2’s companies, acting as nominee shareholders / directors and facilitating their entry into transactions (including the Misappropriation). (1) D1-2’s ownership and control of PBC 83 As to D1-2’s ownership and/or control of PBC: (1) PBC’s original name of ‘Privat Business Centre’ is important evidence of its true ownership. D1-2’s corporate empire/companies are informally known as the “Privat group” and “Privat companies”: {I3/44/2} (¶9); {E1/11P} (tab ‘Introduction’). It is not realistic to think that D1-2 would have allowed a third party to start a business, trading from the same building as their bank, which used their group’s name. (2) The earliest available record on the Ukrainian corporate register (as at 28 July 2004) identifies PBC’s shareholders as five Ukrainian companies, including a Borrower, Rapit. Rapit’s Structure Chart is at {K4-B3/35} – it is held by eight of D1-2’s regular nominees. Rapit was also listed in D2’s 2007 asset list prepared by Anischenko as one of D1-2’s companies: {E1/11P/4}. (3) D1 has advanced an unbelievable account about how he accidentally acquired a 24.79% interest in PBC between September 2013 and February 2014, squarely in the middle of the Misappropriation (“[D1] had no intention to acquire an interest in PBC but did so as follows…”).62 And D2 admits to holding a (separate) interest of 3.54% to 11.08% in PBC between November 2013 and April 2015, but claims he never knew about this interest.63 These suggestions are incredible.  84 PBC has at all times been owned via companies controlled by D1-2 (including Share Pledgors and companies which provided their bank statements to D1 as part of the Lafferty Spreadsheet exercise) and individuals who act as nominees for D1-2.  85 Further, PBC employees hold assets for D1 and D2 valued at hundreds of millions of US$ (for just a subset, see {A1/26} and {A1/27}. It is unreal that D1-2 would have permitted such an arrangement unless they owned/controlled PBC and staffed it with their confidantes who they could trust not to make off with their assets in the absence of any written proof  61  Lozytska/¶38 {B1/6/10-11}.  62  D1Def/¶10C(2)(d) {A1/8/8}, D1 RRFI/¶7 {A2/31.1/5} . 63  D2Def/¶18C(2)(c) {A1/18/9}, App. B {A1/19.1}. \nAA2/1/42\n 37 of their nominee status.

But D1-2 did not reveal that these individuals were employed by PBC. Remarkably, D2 pleads that he “is not acquainted with any of the individuals identified in Schedule 6 [POC]64 (save for Sergiy Melnyk)…” and he does not know whether any of them (except Melnyk) works for PBC.65 (2) D1-2 identified the many other corporate service providers in their disclosure review documents. But PBC was absent. Instead, D1-2 only started to make half-hearted efforts to obtain PBC documents when the Bank raised the issue in correspondence in December 2021 {TR1-C2/5/3} (¶¶13-15).  (3) D1-2 have not tendered Melnyk as a witness, even though he is one of their admitted oral nominees. 87 Since 2018, D1-2 have periodically sought the Bank’s consent under the WFO to pay CPSs’ fees. Yet neither have ever sought consent to make a payment to PBC, despite the ubiquitous use of PBC nominees to hold their assets. The Bank infers that PBC does not charge D1-2 for this service, because PBC is owned by D1-2. (2) D1-2’s use of PBC Nominees 88 D1-2 admit that they hold assets in deliberately opaque corporate structures.66 Many of them involve the use of PBC employees as nominees who act as purported beneficial owners. For example, D1-2’s interest in PJSC Dniproazot was held as follows:67       64  A list of PBC employees/officers and their roles at the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers {A1/7.1/1}.  65  D2Def/¶18C(3)(a)-(c) {A1/18/9}. 66  See e.g. Waugh6/¶37 {KZhRK-1E/31/8} and D2’s “oral agreements”. 67  D1 U/R, Asset 68 {J2/3/94} (and 14.2.18 {J2/4/4} and 13.7.18 {J2/7/4} updates); D2 U/R, Asset 122 {J4/5/139}.  \nAA2/1/43\n 38          89 The top-level nominees identified in the diagram above are all PBC employees who also acted as purported beneficial owners of Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers in these proceedings. Melnyk, Trykyluch and Yesipova were also purported beneficial owners of D3-5 and D8: see the Nominee Charts for Hayvoronska {K4-A/10}, Yesipova {K4-A/33}, Trykyluch {K4-A/29} and Melnyk {K4-A/19}. They all hold their interests for D1-2 under “oral agreements”, evidencing a high degree of trust between them and D1-2.  90 In total, D1’s asset disclosure identifies that 36 of his Ukrainian assets, in which his interests are valued at c. US$1bn, are held via structures involving PBC employees; and D2’s asset disclosure identifies that 79 of his Ukrainian assets, in which his interests are valued at US$470m, are held via structures involving PBC employees. This use of PBC employees as ‘nominee UBOs’ (a contradiction in terms) is long-standing: D2’s 2007 and 2008 asset lists identify PBC employees as the “nominal beneficial owners” or “intermediate beneficial owners” of D1-2 assets {E1/29P}. It is also “inherently dishonest and deceptive”, aimed at rendering “opaque” the link between the company in question and its true owner: NBT, supra, [514] per Bryan J {M1/22/182}. (3) The role of Sergei Melnyk  91 Melnyk, the individual who ran PBC for D1-2, has a particularly pervasive role: (1) He held 11 assets for D1 with a combined value of c. US$183m and 19 assets for D2 with a combined value of c. US$116m,68 pursuant to oral agreements.  68  D1 U/R Assets 42, 43, 45, 49, 65, 68, 69, 70, 82 {J2/3} (Melnyk was belatedly identified in the 14.2.18 {J2/4} and 13.7.18 {J2/7} Updates); D1 Non U/R {J1/3/12} and Update {J1/4/1}; D2 U/R, Assets 4, 17, 22, 30, 33, 41, 42, 46, 47, 48, 53, 54, 81, 99, 115, 119, 122, 127 and 129 {J4/5/2}. \nAA2/1/44\n 39 (2) He was a purporte"}

(3) He was the sole purported beneficial owner of D4 until 2016 and a purported UBO of D3 and D5, along with four other PBC nominees.  (4) He arranged for documents to be executed (and backdated) by companies involved in the Misappropriation and other D1-2 companies: e.g. {E3/184}, {E10/66}. He played a key role in co-ordinating the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings, requesting loans from the Bank to the Borrowers to pay their legal fees: {E6/81}, {E6/82P}. And he had extensive involvement in the Asset Transfer: see ¶392 below.  (5) He had his own extension number on ‘the Black’ {K5-E/3/8}; and D1 has his WhatsApp number {H2/60/3} (¶13). (6) He supposedly loaned c. £1.3m to D3-5 for their legal fees in these proceedings. He did not do so from his own resources: there is no evidence that he had any substantial assets or wealth. (4) PBC’s role in the Misappropriation 92 As set out in greater detail in Sections F and G below: (1) PBC employees were used by D1-2 as the purported beneficial owners of the vast majority of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers;  (2) PBC employees were also used as nominee directors of many of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers; they could be replaced if or when it suited D1-2’s interests to do so (as is clear from the Luchaninov and Rokoman Emails: ¶284ff);  (3) PBC employees (Melnyk, Pugach, Yesipova, Trykulych and Ivlev) were used by D1-2 as the purported beneficial owners of D3-5 and D8; and (4) PBC employees (and in particular Konstantin Barsuk) regularly liaised with BOK regarding (i) the grant, execution, extension and other aspects of the Relevant and Intermediary Loans, (ii) the preparation of the Relevant Supply Agreements, and (iii) the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings. C4 Primecap 93 Primecap is a Cypriot company incorporated in July 2010. It was managed by Novikov who, though notionally a “senior consultant” entitled to a £205,000 salary for 27.5 hours a week \nAA2/1/45\n 40 {E1/294.1/3}, was its “boss” (his email was invboss@primecap.com.cy – standing for ‘investment boss’). According to its filed accounts, Primecap had c. 45 employees in the period 2013-16. (1) D1-2’s ownership and control of Primecap 94 D1-2 admit to having owned stakes in Primecap until c. May 2011 at which point they contend that the ultimate ownership of Primecap passed to its senior employees: D1Def/¶10B {A1/8/7}; D2Def/¶18B {A1/18/8}. In fact, D1-2 continued to own and/or control Primecap:  (1) In April to July 2013, steps were taken to disguise D1-2’s ownership of Primecap by transferring nominal beneficial ownership to Novikov and 11 other Primecap employees (nine of whom are admitted nominees of D1-2).69 However, no dividends were paid to Primecap’s purported employee shareholders in 2013-2016,70 and there is no evidence that this purported transfer constituted some kind of management buy-out or that there was any real alteration to D1-2’s ownership of Primecap.  The reality is that Novikov and the other Primecap employees hold their interests in Primecap for D1-2. (2) In keeping with their attempt to disguise D1-2’s ownership from 2013, Primecap appeared in the Bank’s IFRS related party disclosure lists (required to be signed by D1 and D2) for 2011 and 2012 {E1/122} {E1/232} and NBU related party lists prior to July 2013 {K3-D/4"}

One message, sent to D1 by a Bank employee named Svetlana Melnikova, asked for D1 to confirm that she could make various payments. They included a payment of US$630,000 pursuant to a “request from Timur [Novikov]” made on 20.10.16 in respect of “business aviation, Primecap taxes and social insur, lease of Geneva office …” {K5-A1/42/4}. D1 responded “OK” {K5-A1/42/5}, and not “why am I paying taxes and social insurance in relation to Timur’s company?”  This is compelling evidence of D1-2’s continued ownership of Primecap.   69  This structure, in which no one individual would hold 10% of more of Primecap, appears to have been chosen so that Primecap could be removed from the Bank’s “related parties list”: see {E2/60}. 70  Primecap’s accounts show that it was profit-making (2013: turnover €7.2m, net profit €1m; 2014: turnover €8.2m, net profit €0.8m; 2015: turnover €9.7m, net profit €1.2m; 2016: turnover €9.5m, net profit €1.1m) but that no dividends were paid. See {E4/127.1/4, 7}, {E11/264.1/4, 7}, {E17/229.1/4, 7}, {E17/180.11/4, 7}. \nAA2/1/46\n 41 (2) Primecap’s role: administration of D1-2’s companies 95 Primecap’s employees were individuals transferred over from the Bank (predominantly Novikov’s Investment Department). The available documents show that those individuals continued to perform the same roles they had done while they were at the Bank, administering D1-2’s companies.71 To perform this role, Primecap employees: (1) Maintained close relationships with their former colleagues at the Bank. Primecap staff were able, in effect, to instruct Bank staff to make loans to the companies they administered for D1-2 {E3/93} {E3/94} {E3/95}. Indeed, senior Primecap and Bank management (amongst them Novikov) went on holidays together in October 2016 {E16/33.3}. (2) Liaised directly with Anischenko (D2’s asset administrator), updating him on the companies they were administering and in respect of which they were taking instructions: see e.g. {E1/69} {E1/260.2} {E3/315} {E17/254/1}. 96 Primecap employees also held interests in assets for D1-2. With two exceptions (Gninenko and Armashova), the employees to whom the shares in Primecap were transferred in 2013 hold large numbers of assets as D1-2’s nominees. By way of example, each of Petr Novikov, Dolmatov and Masko appear repeatedly D1-2’s combined 2018 Asset Disclosure invariably holding interests for them pursuant to oral agreements: {J2/3} {J4/5}. (3) Primecap’s role in the Misappropriation 97 As set out in Section F and G below, Primecap: (1) Administered the Cypriot Borrowers (Fiastra, Celastrina and Densitron). (2) Administered D3-8 both before and during the Misappropriation, including by giving numerous instructions for D3-8 to execute (and backdate) RSAs. (3) Administered the Alleged Principals of D3-5 and procured them to execute sham and backdated ‘instructions’ to D3-5 to mislead the latter’s accountants/HMRC.72 (4) Directed the participation of D3-8 in the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings, including by giving instructions for D3-8 to execute sham correspondence and agreements  71  For example, when Nikolai Kravets (Cyprus branch) asked the Primecap, and former Bank, employee Yuliya Prykhodko on 25.11.11: “who are you and what are you working on?”, Prykhodko r"}

(5) Arranged the transfer of D1-2’s assets to the Bank during the Asset Transfer. While D1-2’s disclosure is manifestly deficient here, it is apparent that Primecap ultimately reported to D1-2 in relation to these entities. See Section H below. (6) Operated the generic email addresses used by numerous of D1-2’s non-Ukrainian companies. In 2020 Primecap exchanged emails with Simplex, a Cypriot internet services company, in which Simplex offered to continue to provide the domain names of hundreds of Primecap-controlled companies, including those for D3-8, the Cypriot Borrowers, the Alleged Principals and hundreds of other D1-2 companies.73 C5 Cypriot CSPs used by D1-2 98 D1-2 also used a relatively small number of CSPs, located predominantly in Cyprus, to work alongside PBC and Primecap. These CSPs incorporated (non-Ukrainian) companies for D1-2’s structures and populated them with nominee shareholders and directors. The principal Cypriot CSPs (each of which was also a law firm) were as follows:  (1) Marangos & Hadjipapa (“M&H”), which had a long-standing relationship with D1-274 and had offices in the same building in Limassol as the Bank’s Cyprus branch and Primecap. Marangos acted as a shareholder and director of D5 (Collyer); Marangos and his partner Amalia Hadjipapa acted as directors of D1-2’s companies: e.g. both were directors of Sim Lim Trust Company, the corporate trustee of at least 21 of D2’s trusts which were redomiciled from Jersey to Cyprus in late 2015. Marangos even had his own extension on ‘the Black’ {K5-E/3}. (2) Andreas M Sofocleous & Co LLC (“Sofocleous”), for whom Marangos worked before founding M&H, also has a long-standing relationship with D1-2, providing nominee shareholders/directors to their companies, including D3, D5 and D6-8.  (3) Michalis Tsitsekkos & Associates (“Tsitsekkos & Co”) provided nominees to D1-2 companies for many years, with Michalis Tsitsekkos acting as a director of D3 (Teamtrend) and as a director and shareholder of D4 (Trade Point). Tsitsekkos was a defendant (with D1) to the Shahar Proceedings in 2003, a dispute concerning the ownership and control of D3 (see ¶328 below).   73  {E17/285.1}, {E17/285.2}. 74  See references to Marangos acting for D1-2 in 2006 {I3/12/28} (¶99-101, 134). \nAA2/1/48\n 43 (4) Kyriakides, Savvides & Associates and SK Law (Symeou & Konnaris) are further Cypriot law firms which provided corporate services to D1-2’s companies. 99 As set out in the Bank’s Structure Charts, employees of these Cypriot CSPs acted as the shareholders in the offshore companies which held interests in the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers: see Section G below.    \nAA2/1/49\n 44 D D1-2’S CONTROL OF THE BANK 100 D1-2 owned 90%+ of the Bank’s shares and exercised control over (at least) its Supervisory and Management Boards and those departments involved in the Misappropriation (in particular, Gurieva’s BOK and Novikov’s Investment Business).

Specifically: (1) D1-2 used their shareholdings in the Bank and positions on the Supervisory Board to install their key lieutenants, including Novikov, Dubilet, Yatsenko and Gurieva, onto the Management Board and into other key positions, heading BOK (Gurieva), the Investment Business (Novikov), and the Corporate VIP Business (Yatsenko).  (2) Those lieutenants acted on D1-2’s instructions. And more junior Bank employees did what they were told, even where instructions were obviously contrary to Ukrainian law and/or the Bank’s interests, because they wanted to keep their jobs.  D1 D1-2’s shareholdings in the Bank and associated rights  101 D1-2 admit that, at all relevant times, they collectively owned 90%+ of the Bank’s shares.75 These shareholdings are important for two reasons. 102 First, as a matter of law, it meant that D1-2 controlled decisions made at general shareholders’ meetings.76 As provided by clause 9.2.1 of the Bank’s articles of association (the “Charter”) and Art. 38 of the Law on Banks:  Article 38(1):77 “The supreme management body of the bank is the general meeting of participants.” Article 38(2):78 “The competence of the general meeting of the bank includes making decisions on: (1) determination of the main directions of the bank’s activities and approval of reports on their implementation […] (4) appointment and dismissal of chairmen and members of the supervisory board of the bank, the audit commission […] The powers defined by [sub-]paragraphs 1 to 7 of this article are within the exclusive competence of the general meeting of participants. […]” Charter/¶9.2.1(11){C1/211/4}: “[Shareholders are required to approve in general meeting] internal regulations ‘on the supervisory board’, [and] ‘on the management board’ …” 103 Second, as a matter of reality, everyone working in the Bank knew who its owners were, not least because they are high-profile oligarchs with reputations as aggressive businessmen. The prospect that Bank employees would do anything other than implement D1-2’s instructions  75  D1Def/¶6(3) {A1/8/3}. See to similar effect D2Def/¶14 {A1/18/6}. Of the remaining c. 10%, Dubilet held 2.75%, Novikov 1.36%, Yatsenko 0.32%, and Gurieva and Chmona 0.2422% each: see {K1/224}. 76  See clause 9.2.1 of the Bank’s Charter adopted on 12.2.13 {C1/211/3}. 77  {C9.3/2/9} was in force between 1.1.13 and 10.1.15, after which the same was provided for in Art. 37(1){C1/25/9}. 78  {C9.3/2/9-10} (in force between 1.1.13 and 10.1.15); its amended version is at {C1/25/10}. \nAA2/1/50\n 45 (as relayed by their lieutenants) was non-existent. As the Bank’s witnesses observe: “The primary function of BOK was to provide banking services (such as loans) to the Bank’s so-called ‘strategic clients’, which I understood at the time were companies within [D1] and [D2’s] wider business group. … The Head of BOK was Tatiana Gurieva …. Because of her senior position … my assumption at the time was that Ms Gurieva would have received instructions directly from the Bank’s former owners, [D1] and [D2].” (Luchaninov/¶¶13-14 {B1/3/5}) “At the time of the above emails, I suspected it was probably the case that the changes to the corporate structures and tasks requested in those emails were able to be requested by the Bank because, in reality the companies in question were ultimately beneficially owned or controlled by [D1] and [D2] who were also the shareholders of the Bank. … It was not my job to raise suspicions or start investigations in respect of companies which, on the face of their docum"}

Had I refused to perform a task which I had been ordered to do, I was sure that I would have lost my job. …” (Pogorelaya/¶22 {B1/8/7} (In a meeting between D1 and Rozhkova) “… [D1] was at pains to make clear he would be able to reach us even from Israel, saying ‘I have very long arms’. After Ms Gontareva left the meeting to attend to other matters, [D1] looked at me, touching his stomach, and said that he was a ‘hungry tiger in a cage, but the door is open – so you can leave’ and repeated what he had said earlier about having long arms, but going further this time and saying that he would be able to find me anywhere. I had (and continue to have) no doubt that this was a physical threat he was making against me.” (Rozhkova/¶218 {B1/5/54}) “I am aware that the Bank has alleged that at least some existing Bank employees were ‘loyal’ to [D1 and D2], and therefore not loyal to the new management team. I entirely agree with that description. I would also like to emphasise that it was common for the Bank’s staff to have been in place for many years and for a lot of them, - their entire employment period. […] Moreover, by the second half of 2017, [D1 and D2] had begun to challenge the legality of the Bank’s nationalisation and my impression at the time was that this reinforced the belief amongst the Bank’s staff that they would regain control over the Bank.” (Pakhachuk/¶18 {B1/1/6}). 104 D1-2’s omnipresence and omnipotence are reflected in a number of disclosed documents. See, e.g., the following Skype and email exchanges involving BOK employees: Kazantsev (BOK), complaining to another Bank employee: “The company [Tekhspets, a Borrower] is a strategic client, the director of which is [Akimova], they could not sign a loan agreement under the program initiated by the shareholder of the bank due to the situation yesterday. … Please be sure to correct the [Unified Client Database] for the specified customer; the lack of correct data jeopardises the timely implementation of the shareholder programme.” Kazantsev email of 26.6.13 {E2/40.1}  Gubanova (BOK) “IV [the initials of a BOK employee], is P-25 with Ukrneft working properly??” Scherbakova (BOK) “I ASSOCIATE IV ONLY WITH ONE IV [sc.

Until late April 2015, i.e. during the period of the Misappropriation, D2 was Chair of that board, whose other members were D1 and Martynov.  106 At a shareholders’ meeting held on 27-30.4.15, D1-2 voted to appoint a five-member Supervisory Board. This change was, according to the minutes, required by a recent amendment to the Law on Banks: {E9/95/31} (agenda items 19-20). Stelmakh was elected Chair,79 though any notion that he would provide rigorous independence to the Board can be swiftly discounted. See, e.g., Stelmakh’s message to D1 of 7.6.18: “Very respected Igor Valeryevich, I kindly ask you to spend 15-20 minutes of your precious time for our meeting. We really need your advice. Appoint a day and place to meet. …” {K5-A1/59/2}. 107 D1-2’s membership of, and control over, the Supervisory Board is significant given its wide-ranging powers. By Art. 37(3) of the Law on Banks, the Supervisory Board is charged with monitoring the activities of the Management Board and protecting the rights of depositors, other creditors and shareholders {C1/25/9}. The powers granted by Art. 39(5) of the Law on Banks {C1/25/11} include approving a bank’s development strategy, budget, lending policy, organisational structure, and internal regulations. More importantly still, it includes: “(11) appointment and dismissal of the chairman and members of the [management board]....” “(12) exercising control over, and proposing improvements to, the activities of the [management board]” “(18) approving the terms and conditions of any civil or employment contracts to be entered into with members of the [management board] … and determining the amount of their remuneration ...” 108 These functions were reflected in, and supplemented by, clause 9.3.3 of the Bank’s Charter and clause 3.1 of the regulations of the Supervisory Board (the “SB Regulations”).80 Additional responsibilities contained in the SB Regulations were:  79  Though D2 continued to act as Chair until 2.6.16: {K1/98} (18.5.16), {K1/99} (19.5.16), {K1/100} (25.5.16) and {K1/101} (2.6.16). 80  See the SB Regulations adopted by the Bank’s shareholders on 8.8.11 {C1/215/2}, 25.4.14 {C1/216/2} and {C1/217/2} (on 27-30.4.15). \nAA2/1/52\n 47 “decision-making on … transactions with related parties where the market value of services is over USD 500,000 (five hundred thousand) (or equivalent)” (¶3.1.45) (from 30.4.15) “approval of the procedure for related party transactions” (¶3.1.59) “defining and approving risk management strategies and policies, risk management procedures, and the list of risks and limit levels” (¶3.1.48) “monitoring the effectiveness of the risk management system” (¶3.1.50) 109 The power to appoint (and dismiss) the Chair and members of the Bank’s Management Board is particularly important. As explained below, D1-2 stacked that board with executives – including Dubilet, Novikov, Yatsenko and Gurieva – who would do as they were told. (2) The Supervisory Board in practice 110 D1-2 seek to downplay their roles on the Supervisory Board. D1, for example, pleads that the Supervisory Board “did not manage the Bank on a day to day basis”, and that many significant decisions were made “by executive officers of the Bank without [his] involvement” {A1/8/5} (¶7(2)(b)). And D2 says that the Supervisory Board had “only a high level general supervisory role” and that in June 2014 he “decided to reduce his limited role on the Supervisory Board” {A1/18/11} (¶¶25-26). These are very considerable understatements.  111 First, D2’s CVs from 2011-2016 emphasised that D2’s position as Chair/Member of the Supervisory Board was D2’s most important business role (and that the Bank was one of his most important businesses).

For example, the first entry in D2’s June 2016 CV said: “Privatbank – member of the Supervisory Board, interest in the capital (41.5769% share as of 01.06.2016). PrivatBank is one of the largest financial institutions in Ukraine having nationwide network of approximately 2,350 branches and offices and own capital of UAH 21.2 billion (US$ 0.8 billion). PrivatBank also has subsidiary bank in Latvia and branch in Cyprus.”81 112 Second, D2’s involvement with the Supervisory Board actually increased over the course of 2013-16: the Supervisory Board held 27 meetings in 2013, 37 meetings in 2014, 54 meetings in 2015, and 81 meetings in 2016.82  113 Third, until 30.4.15 only D2 and Martynov ever attended or voted on Supervisory Board resolutions, with D2 as Chair. They approved a range of resolutions, including: (i) internal regulations/codes, such as a corporate ethics code for the Privatbank group on 31.1.13 {K1/9};  the procedure for remunerating the Bank’s senior management on 21.10.13 {K1/29}; and the Bank’s corporate governance system on 19.3.15 {K1/85}; (ii) commercial initiatives, such as: the purchase of new shares in Privatbank (Moscow) {K1/14},  81  {E12/168.1}.

Such messages evidence both (i) the nature of the relationship established between D1-2 and Management Board members prior to nationalisation; and (ii) the fact that D1-2 remain close with these individuals, notwithstanding that they were responsible for approving the fraudulent transactions at the heart of these proceedings, of which D1-2 deny any knowledge and, indeed, paint themselves as the victims.  83  See, e,g, {K1/24}, {K1/36} (promoting Gorokhovsky to First Deputy Chair), {K1/93}, and {K1/96}.  \nAA2/1/54\n 49 (1) Dubilet (Chair of the Management Board) 117 D1 has disclosed only one pre-nationalisation WhatsApp message with Dubilet.84 But the following examples from the hundreds of post-nationalisation WhatsApp messages show that Dubilet is a man who regularly followed D1’s instructions, in breach of Ukrainian law, and against the Bank’s best interests: (1) Dubilet provided D1 with confidential information from within the Bank. On 9.3.17, shortly after nationalisation, Dubilet sent D1 a message informing him that the Ukrainian President was to hold a meeting at 3pm that day to discuss “fulfilment of obligations by [the Bank’s] shareholders” {K5-A1/17/3}. The participants were, Dubilet said, Gontareva (Governor of the NBU), Volodymyr Groysman (Prime Minister), Oleksandr Danilyuk (Minister of Finance), and Oleksandr Shlapak (the Bank’s post-nationalisation Chair). The next day, Dubilet sent D1 a letter that had been drafted by Shlapak to the President: {K5-A1/17/3-4} and {K5-B5/1}. The letter explained that the Bank’s loan book had performed badly in the months after nationalisation, and invited the President to arrange a meeting between D1, D2, the NBU, the Ministry of Finance and the Bank. Importantly, the letter was in draft – it must have been obtained by Dubilet from Bank employees who remained loyal to him and D1, acting against the Bank’s post-nationalisation management.  (2) Information regarding the Bank’s audit position. On 15.3.17, Dubilet messaged D1 to say: “Good news – PWC is not recalling the 2015 PB audit after internal investigation”. D1 responded with \n👍. Dubilet then added: “The information is presented by Volkova [a senior PwC audit manager] in the presence of a PWC employee, albeit verbally, but formally, during a conversation with Shmalchenko at the PWC office”. To this D1 sent a ‘v’ for victory emoji (\n✌). The next day, Dubilet added  that his source was “Shcherbakova” (seemingly Svitlana Shcherbakova, a BOK employee) {K5-A1/17/4}. Again, Dubilet was leveraging his relationships with Bank employees who were acting against the interests of its new management.85  (3) Dubilet obtained information from within the Bank about the Asset Transfer. On 3.5.17, Dubilet messaged D1 about the Bank’s main office building in Kyiv known  84  Dated 23.12.15, it reads “They [sc. possibly the NBU] confirmed the meeting at 11:00am” {K5-A1/16/2}. This message had been deleted from D1’s phone and had to be recovered.  85  There are other examples. Thus on 28.7.17 Dubilet sent D1 the following message: “Today, Dreling [sc. Oleksandr Dreling, a member of the Bank’s post-nationalisation Management Board] … passed on information that the [NBU] was seriously discussing the liquidation of Privatbank with the IMF” {K5-A1/17/25}. \nAA2/1/55\n 50 as 10 Museum Alley, transferred as part of the Asset Transfer {K5-A1/17/9}: Dubilet “Museinyi is on the Bank’s balance sheet” D1 “For how much?” Dubilet “I can find out tomorrow morning.” D1 “OK” Dubilet (3 days later) “5631 sq m – UAH 321,000,000.” (4) Dubilet and D1 procure"}

On 25.7.19, Dubilet told D1 at 9:59 “… we need the team of Glukhoverya – the head of police in the region [sc. the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast] – to question [Petr] Krumphanzl [sc. the Bank’s then CEO] tomorrow” {K5-A1/19/8}. Six hours later, Dubilet sent another message to D1, saying “Thank you!!!! three police officers told Bolotin [sc. the Bank’s Head of Security] that if Krumphanzl doesn’t come in, they will bring him in forcibly” (ibid.). D1’s ability to use the local police to pressurise the Bank’s new CEO is a chilling example of the sway he held even after nationalisation; and amply demonstrates that Bank employees would do whatever they were told if they thought the instructions came from the Bank’s shareholders.  118 D1 and Dubilet maintained a close relationship post-nationalisation. For example, Dubilet – and his family – were often permitted to travel on D1’s private jets;86 and Dubilet worked in Geneva, alongside D1-2, as shown by the post-April 2017 Black directory {K5-E/3/2}. 119 Turning to D2, he was in frequent contact with Dubilet prior to nationalisation: D2’s telephone records show that he spoke with Dubilet 108 times (for a total of 457 minutes) between 3.2.14 and 28.5.14 on the normal cellular network (i.e. not including ‘the Black’ or WhatsApp).87 Notwithstanding the deficiencies in D2’s disclosure, examples of what the two men discussed are as follows: (1) Dubilet updated and took instructions from D2 regarding D1-2’s asset empire. On 26.2.13, Dubilet sent D2 an email asking for “guidance on limits for 2013”. He was seeking D2’s approval for the grant of loan facilities to seven senior managers in  86  Thus on 29.5.17 Dubilet sent D1 his own passport number together with the passport numbers of six other people – including at least two relatives {K5-A1/17/11}. D1 was arranging for Dubilet and others to travel to Cyprus on his private jet: see Dubilet’s message to D1 of 1.6.17 (“Everyone had a great flight. Thank you! Timur [Novikov] handed over the keys. Checked into the apartment” {K5-A1/17/12}). A similar holiday took place over Christmas 2018, with four members of Dubilet’s family being flown to Tel Aviv and Dubilet and one other going on to Verona {K5-A1/18/3}. And again in June and August 2019: {K5-A1/19/5} {K5-A1/19/10}. On the latter occasion, Dubilet told D1: “They arrived in Dnipro. Thank you for a great holiday! ...” (ibid). 87  {K5-E/4}, {K5-E/5}, {K5-E/6} and {K5-E/7}.  Telephone numbers used by Dubilet were +380675223030 and +972548031691. \nAA2/1/56\n 51 D1-2’s asset empire.88 On 7.11.13 Dubilet emailed D2 to say “Chmona said that you gave the command to increase the funding limit to 17.5 thousand per month. Please acknowledge it” {E2/190}. And on 17.12.13, Dubilet sent D2 an email containing information on the performance of D1-2’s jointly owned agriculture business {E2/223.1}. (2) D2 instructed Dubilet when he had identified new business opportunities for the Bank. As explained below, on 11.3.15 D2 forwarded to Dubilet a request received in relation to whether the Bank could make a €3 million transfer to Cuba {E8/75}. Later, on 1.9.16, D2 sent Dubilet an email with the subject line “They are proposing this structure” {E15/131.1} with an attachment setting out the proposed structure and security (over two business centres in central Kyiv) for a commercial transaction {E15/131.2}.

As explained below, on 11.3.15 D2 forwarded to Dubilet a request received in relation to whether the Bank could make a €3 million transfer to Cuba {E8/75}. Later, on 1.9.16, D2 sent Dubilet an email with the subject line “They are proposing this structure” {E15/131.1} with an attachment setting out the proposed structure and security (over two business centres in central Kyiv) for a commercial transaction {E15/131.2}.  (3) D2 discussed assets with Dubilet in the context of the Asset Transfer. On 2.9.16, D2 received an email from Sergei Distergov (the chair of, and a minority shareholder in, the company operating Hotel Split). It explained issues relating to Hotel Split (seemingly connected with the Asset Transfer). D2 forwarded the email to Dubilet within half an hour of receipt, asking “What should be done?” {E15/132.1}. It is inevitable that D2 would also have discussed other Asset Transfer issues with Dubilet (see e.g. an email sent to him on 6.7.16 explaining that certain transferred assets were significantly overvalued {E14/303.1}).  120 The nature of D2’s relationship with Dubilet is evident from the following: (i) on 4.1.13, Dubilet sent D2 various videos and photographs taken at Dubilet’s October 2012 birthday party {E1/236.01} {E1/236.02}; (ii) the two men shared health tips on 21.8.13 and 11.6.14 {E2/86.1} {E4/16.1}; and (iii) Dubilet often helped D2 with administrative matters well below the pay grade of the Bank’s CEO.89 (2) Gurieva (Member of the Management Board; Head of BOK) 121 D1’s disclosure of his WhatsApp messages with Gurieva, though substantially incomplete,  88  {E1/259}. Maksimenko, for example, has been described by D1’s solicitors as a long-time employee of Privat Intertrading, holding the position of the head of the ferroalloy department: Fieldfisher (2.12.22, 4th) {L/113/2} (¶5.6). His 2013 facility limit was US$1.02m. Volokovoy regularly sent D2 emails in relation to the payment of dividends by D1-2’s companies: {E1/238}. His facility limit was US$1.374m. And Dubinin was in 2013 Chair of the Board of PJSC Dniproazot, a large chemicals company in which D1-2 had a significant stake: {J2/3/94} and {J4/5/139}. He was granted a facility of US$180,000. D2 and Dubilet exchanged further emails on this topic in December 2013: {E2/247/1} and {E2/248P/1}. 89  He provided an analysis of D2’s card payments on 23.1.13 {E1/239.3}, helped D2 with a mobile-phone related query on 11.11.13 {E2/194.1/1}, sought on 13.11.13 to arrange a Viber text message system to update D2 on his bank account balances {E2/200.1/1}, and provided D2 with bank card details on 9.10.13 and 17.1.14 {E3/18.1}. \nAA2/1/57\n 52 demonstrates that she acted on his instructions. Prior to nationalisation, Gurieva regularly sought D1’s permission to make business-related payments for D1-2 companies. E.g.:  Gurieva “Dear Igor Valeryevich, there are taxes from SD UN [which the Bank understands to be a reference to Ukrnafta, a D1-2 company] (confirmed by Uri) for approval: 1. Excise duty on liquid gas – 15.7 million, 2. Target gas allowance 2% surcharge – 7.4 million, 3. Other minor – 7.0 million.” D1 “OK” D1 WhatsApp exchange with Gurieva on 29.7.15 {K5-A1/27/2}90 122 In addition to procuring payment approvals, Gurieva arranged financing for D1-2’s assets/companies through BOK. For example, on 3.2.11 Novikov emailed Gurieva and Melnyk budgets for the “Privatland program” that had already been agreed by D2. Novikov asked Gurieva to determine the size of the credit line. Within an hour, Gurieva had set one of her team, Alexey Ponomarev, to work. Significantly, the Privatland companies included three Borrowers, four Intermediary Borrowers, an Asset Transferor and a Share Pledge company.91 Similarly, on 20.3.12, Gurieva forwarded a request for lending from “Gennad[i]y Borisovich’s Academ[y] Club” (which request appears to bear his signature and the manuscript note ‘Agreed’) to Ponomarev “for processing” {E1/142.1} {E1/142.2}. 123 Guri"}

Gurieva was working hard on this task in January 2018, messaging D1 to say “Good afternoon, I am in the office” on 5.1.18, and asking whether she could still work in D1’s office on (Saturday) 13.1.18 even though D1 wouldn’t be coming in (“the secretaries gave me the key …”) {K5-A1/32/3}. Other messages from this period show D1 giving Gurieva instructions (e.g. “Send it to DAV [sc. Dubilet]” on 28.11.17 {K5-A1/32/2}), and wishing Gurieva happy new year/birthday {K5-A1/32/2} {K5-A1/32/4} {K5-A1/33/2}. As late as 7.6.19, Gurieva messaged D1 to say “I’m here, thank you very much! I will be in the office Monday, I look forward to  receiving the tasks” {K5-A1/34/2}.  90  Similar requests for permission were made on 19.6.15, 30.7.15, 2.10.15, 22.3.16, 23.3.16: {K5-A1/27/2} and {K5-A1/30}.  91  {E1/83.1}, {E1/83.2}, {E1/83.3}; Borrowers: Investgroup, Dorteks, Uniks; Intermediary Borrowers: Florex-Industries, Lazurnii Bereg, Mondial, Vinibur; Asset Transferor: Agroaviadnepr; Share Pledge company: Derling. \nAA2/1/58\n 53 125 Given that Gurieva was the Head of BOK and that she would do as D1-2 instructed, it follows that D1-2 controlled BOK. Further: (i) D1 procured two former BOK employees – Koryak and Kazantsev – to give evidence for him in this litigation in 2018: see ¶168 below; and (ii) in addition to Gurieva, five former members of BOK helped to prepare the Lafferty Spreadsheets {H2/52/3}: Gubanova, Taranenko, Liliya Kurasova, Inna Demidchenko and Artem Myakenkyi: {E2/79} and {E10/271}. (3) Lyubov Chmona (Management Board Member; Head of Budgeting Department) 126 Chmona regularly sought and received D1’s consent for the making of payments around D1-2’s asset empire both before and after nationalisation: {K5-A1/11/2}; {K5-A1/12/2}; {K5-A1/13/2}; {K5-A1/14/2}. By way of example, on 21.10.15 Chmona sought and received D1’s consent for numerous payments relating to D1-2’s industrial assets: Chmona “Igor Valerievich, payments for 21.10.2015: NZF: UAH 14,631.7 thous … including: coke 9,663.4; forwarding 2,000.0l coal 1,464.0; PPE powder 706.5; … lime 251.3; [detailed information is then given in relation to D1-2’s ZZF, OGOK, MGOK, TGOK, Azot and KZhRK assets].” D1 “OK” D1 WhatsApp exchange with Chmona on 21.10.15 {K5-A1/11/3} 127 Other messages of note show that (i) Chmona performed a wide-ranging role for D1, attending to licensing issues with the KZhRK mine {K5-A1/13/10} and a street lighting problem that had been raised with D1 by a Rabbi {K5-A1/13/3}; (ii) Chmona worked in D1-2’s offices in Geneva in 2018 (“Igor …, can I work in Riga on Monday – Tuesday? Will be in the office on Wednesday morning” {K5-A1/13/9}); and (iii) D1 and Chmona have a relationship of some familiarity, exchanging New Year wishes {K5-A1/13/2} {K5-A1/13/10}. Indeed, Chmona had various extensions on the Black – initially in Dnipro and Cyprus {K5-E/2/5}, later adding extensions in Geneva and Riga {K5-E/3/6}.  128 Standing back, the fact that a member of the Bank’s executive management spent her time sending detailed text messages seeking consent for the making of on occasion de minimis payments "}

Indeed, Chmona had various extensions on the Black – initially in Dnipro and Cyprus {K5-E/2/5}, later adding extensions in Geneva and Riga {K5-E/3/6}.  128 Standing back, the fact that a member of the Bank’s executive management spent her time sending detailed text messages seeking consent for the making of on occasion de minimis payments around D1-2’s corporate empire is a striking indication of the control that D1-2 exercised over the Bank. Hundreds of further messages were sent by Melnikova, an employee of the Budgeting Department, and Markova, an employee of the Cyprus branch (see ¶¶137-138 below). These messages bear out Luchaninov’s observation that “[a]s with BOK, the purpose of the Budgeting Business was to keep [D1-2’s] businesses operating” {B1/3/6} (¶18). \nAA2/1/59\n 54 (4) Volodymyr Yatsenko 129 Yatsenko – First Deputy Chair, Head of the Corporate VIP Business – acted on D1-2’s instructions pre- and post-nationalisation. For example: (1) In March 2015, it was Yatsenko, Novikov and Pikush who asked Luchaninov to work out a plan for eliminating connections between D1-2 and 42 BOK clients (all Borrowers) identified by the NBU: see below.   (2) In October-November 2016 Yatsenko was responsible for sending the various iterations of the Transformation Plan to the NBU, and for answering questions the NBU’s inspectors raised in relation to the same {E16/28} {E16/65} {E16/205}. (3) In early February 2018, Yatsenko travelled to Geneva with an unidentified companion to meet D1, D2, Novikov, Gorokhovsky and (it is to be inferred) Gurieva and Dubilet (who were in Geneva at the time).92 The meetings were held at an unidentified location on 13.2.18 (probably D1-2’s Geneva office), and later at the Michelin-starred Restaurant La Chaumiere, just outside Geneva. They were doubtless convened by D1-2 and these ex-Bank employees to discuss D1-2’s response to these proceedings (the WFO was served on 21.12.17 and D1-2’s jurisdiction challenges were to be served on 9.3.18) (the “Geneva Meetings”). (4) On 12.9.18, D1 sent Yatsenko five documents by WhatsApp {K5-A1/62/3}. They were draft requests for mutual legal assistance sent by the Ukrainian authorities in relation to an alleged fraud on the Bank to the Austrian, British, BVI, Cypriot and Luxembourgian authorities: {K5-B17/1} to {K5-B17/5}.  (5) Yatsenko provided a trial witness statement on behalf of D1. (5) Yuriy Pikush 130 Pikush, the Management Board’s General Deputy Chair, was heavily implicated in concealing and eliminating connections between D1-2 and BOK’s customers. For example: (1) In February 2014, having received an email from Luchaninov informing him that the NBU had complained of a “violation” in respect of “a failure to provide supporting documents and information on the customers of the Cyprus branch” to its auditors {E3/63}, Pikush wrote to Dubilet noting that “there’ll be problems regarding the concentration of related borrowers (Novikov is aware of this issue).  I suggested having Morgachov bring the ‘right’  92  {K5-A2/3/32} (D1 message to D2 at 12.37 on 14.2.18); {K5-A1/50/22} (D1 message to Novikov at 12:42); {K5-A1/62/2} (D1 message to Yatsenko, also at 12:42), {K5-A1/65/4} (D1 message to Gorokovsky, also at 12:42).  \nAA2/1/60\n 55 documents in Donetsk and show them to the auditors and then get out” {E3/65}; he sent a similar email to Novikov, again reiterating the need for “the drafting of the ‘right’ documents on the beneficiaries of the subordinated loans”{E3/66/2}. (2) In February 2015, following the publication of the NashiGroshi article alleging that D1-2 companies had misappropriated US$1.8bn from the Bank (as to which see further ¶284ff below), Pikush was responsible for “investigat[ing] the facts of disclosure that led to publication of bank secrets related to transactions of bank customers” {E7/309.1"}

(2) In February 2015, following the publication of the NashiGroshi article alleging that D1-2 companies had misappropriated US$1.8bn from the Bank (as to which see further ¶284ff below), Pikush was responsible for “investigat[ing] the facts of disclosure that led to publication of bank secrets related to transactions of bank customers” {E7/309.1/2}; he was also one of those who instructed Luchaninov to consider how “connections” between D1-2 and BOK’s clients could be “removed”,93 and was a recipient of the Luchaninov Email.94 (3) In addition, Pikush (i) was an ECC member, authorised 129 Relevant Loans, and signed 15 Relevant Loans; (ii) was party to internal correspondence referring to “loan agreements for foreign currencies” pursuant to which, “[a]ccording to the agreed procedure, customers were given loans in domestic and foreign currency and then the funds were transferred as advance payments under foreign trade agreements” {E8/143}; and (iii) in relation to the Transformation, was party to discussions within the Bank about the “lack of acceptable collateral” for the New Loans {E17/16} and about the NBU’s concerns that the New Borrowers had “non-transport ownership structure; lack of company cash flows; [and] small staff sizes” {E17/31}. (6) Oleg Gorokhovsky 131 Gorokhovsky’s role was primarily in the retail division of the Bank, although he was also a member of the ECC that approved the Relevant Loans.  D1 belatedly disclosed a series of WhatsApp messages with Gorokhovsky that show a close relationship between the two men. For example, on 4.2.18 Gorokhovsky told D1 “Happy Birthday :) Destroy all enemies and never change. You are a wonderful person!” {K5-A1/65/4}; on 28.6.18, D1 and Gorokovsky exchanged messages regarding football {K5-A1/65/9}; D1 sent Gorokhovsky various memes, comic videos and festive messages throughout the chat {K5-A1/65/9, 15, 18}; and on 3.6.19, Dubilet appears to have arranged to fly to Dnipro with Gorokhovsky on D1’s private jet {K5-A1/19/5}.  132 Most significantly, Gorokhovsky:  93  Luchaninov1/¶52 {B1/3/13}. 94  {E8/160}; Luchaninov1/¶57 {B1/3/14}.  \nAA2/1/61\n 56 (1) Attended the Geneva Meetings on 13.2.18 - 14.2.18; (2) Provided an “Analytical Note” to D1 on 12.7.18 entitled ‘Status of Processing Capacities of [the Bank] at July 2018’ that had been “compiled based on the results of the expedited audit of, and investigation into, the causes of massive interruptions of customer service on 9.07.2018” {K5-A1/65/10} {K5-B18/20}; and (3) Provided D1 with regular updates about IT difficulties being faced by the Bank (e.g. “They tried to update the Cisco routers for the third time and failed again. … Incompetent idiots” {K5-A1/65/11}; “They have been preparing cashbacks for cards for six months. Then I wrote a post and they cancelled the project. They are like blind kittens …”; “They are very stormy all the time. It is like cancer stage 3. A little more and the chemistry will stop helping” – D1 enquired a week later “How is the cancer patient?” {K5-A1/65/17}). (7) Quid pro quo 133 In return, and aside from their remuneration from the Bank, D1-2’s other companies and/or Primecap, D1-2’s lieutenants obtained shares in the Bank: as of 31.3.16, D1-2’s combined interest in the Bank was 91.55%; of the remaining 8.45%, Dubilet held 2.75%, Novikov 1.36%, Yatsenko 0.32%; and Gurieva and Chmona 0.2422% each: see {K1/224}. D4 Other Bank employees 134 As a matter of reality, there was zero chance that rank-and-file Bank employees would do anything other than comply with D1-2’s instructions. Two examples are given below.

That consent is almost always forthcoming. For example:  Melnikova “Igor Valeryevich, payments as of 02.12.2015: MGOK: 4 766.2 thousand UAH (electricity). KZRK: 13795,5 thousand UAH, including: salary 6291,0; switchgear 1628.9; GSM 1621.6 (scratch cards, Avias); PPE 814.2; explosives 807.8; railway 768,6 salary to imported equipment 572,3; cement 380 …” D1 “OK” D1 exchange with Melnikova on 2.12.15 {K5-A1/41/24} (2) The messages were sent on a near daily basis between 17.9.15 and 6.1.16, and related to a large number of D1-2’s businesses (e.g. TGOK, NGOK, OGOK, KZhRK). \nAA2/1/62\n 57 136 As has already been set out at ¶94(3) above, D1 also approved Melnikova’s request to make a payment of “630t[housand] request from Timur [Novikov] (business aviation; Primecap taxes and social insur., lease of Geneva office …) …” {K5-A1/42/4}.  (2) Marina Markova 137 The only pre-nationalisation text messages disclosed by D2 comprise a string of 31 messages exchanged with Markova between 14.4.11 and 23.4.12. As with Melnikova’s messages with D1, they show Markova asking D2 for his consent for the making of payments around his and D1’s corporate empire. The following is a simple example: Markova “At 11/07 from Uri 3,3 million doles [sic] at Euro Tires, Romania. Including 2,3 – investment budget and 1,0 – operational budget for the Romanian bus project. Agreed with KIV [sc. D1].” D2 “OK” D2 SMS exchange with Markova on 11.7.12 {E18/176P} 138 Further:  (1) D2 was in regular communication with Markova around the time of the Bank’s nationalisation: D2 sent her two texts on 13.12.16, two more texts on 14.12.16 and 15.12.16 (plus a short call), with further texts on 23.12.16 and 17.1.17.95  (2) D2 has disclosed 39 WhatsApp messages he exchanged with Markova between 7.7.20 and 12.5.21. Though heavily redacted, they confirm that Markova was still carrying out a treasury function for him (and D1) years after nationalisation {K5-A2/14/4}. (3) In 2018-19, D1 received messages from Markova which included the bank balances of over 20 companies/individuals, and D1 authorised Markova to make payments (presumably from those accounts) including by Sanderlyn and Versala (which funded D6-8’s legal fees in these proceedings).

D5 The Fraudulent New Loan Claims 139 In September and October 2017, the Bank commenced proceedings to enforce three of the  95  {K5-E/8/2}, {K5-E/8/3}, {K5-E/8/8}. 96  See, e.g., {K5-A1/40/19}: Markova: “… Latvia (PNB): … Dilorsano [redacted amount] € + [redacted amount, presumably in US$] … 400,000 dollars from Dilorsano (PNB) repayment of loan and % to Cyprus branch”; D1: “OK.” \nAA2/1/63\n 58 New Borrowers’ loans.97 Those claims were issued pursuant to the Bank’s routine – almost automated – processes for dealing with delinquent borrowers.98 Shortly after the third claim was issued on 19.10.17, and in the light of investigations which were being undertaken in relation to this claim, an instruction was given within the Bank: no further claims were to be issued against the New Borrowers (the “Stop Instruction”).99  140 Despite this instruction, 40 sets of claims seeking to enforce the New Loans were issued, having purportedly been signed by in-house Bank "}

Five of the six claims purportedly signed by Bondarenko were against the same New Borrowers as the 17 prior claims that had purportedly been signed by Hyrn. In each case the ‘Bondarenko’ claim was signed about 2-3 weeks after the ‘Hyrn’ claim. It is unclear why this was done, though one obvious possibility is that the perpetrator(s) of this scheme became concerned that the first wave of claims had been rejected. In relation to the claim against Start-N LLC, it appears that only one claim was issued, which was purportedly signed by Bondarenko.  101  Hryn/¶27(c) {B1/16/8}; Bondarenko/¶25 {B1/11/6}. 102  Hryn/¶¶24, 27(b) {B1/16/7}. \nAA2/1/64\n 59 amended; (iv) the dates on which demands for payment were sent; and (v) the calculation of the interest due. The claims also annexed copies of various documents from the Bank’s files, including the relevant New Loans themselves.  (2) A comparison between (i) the draft claim documents103 prepared within the Bank before the Stop Instruction was given; and (ii) the Fraudulent New Loan Claims as issued, shows that the two sets of documents are materially identical (save for minor formatting changes and revisions to the list of exhibits). In other words, the draft documents on the Bank’s files must have been used by or leaked to whomever instituted the claims. 143 Further, the Fraudulent New Loan Claims can only have been procured by D1-2. D1 has disclosed WhatsApp messages which show that he was obtaining secret information from within the Bank about the Stop Instruction. On 14.11.17 (i.e. about a week before 11 of the Fraudulent New Loan Claims were issued), D1 said this to Arsen Avakov (Ukraine’s Minister of Internal Affairs): D1 “Info from the Bank – to fend off prosecutors for not filing the claims w.r.t. 36 [sc. the 36 New"}

Nobody else had a plausible motive, or the practical ability, to procure the institution of the Fraudulent New Loan Claims.  D6 Privileged information about this claim 145 Hogan Lovells were instructed in August 2017 and took unusual precautions to ensure the secrecy of their work, and in particular the Bank’s proposed WFO application: Oleksiyenko/¶¶55-62 {B1/10/14}. That application was filed late on Friday 15.12.17. On Monday 18.12.17, Chris Hardman of Hogan Lovells attended a Supervisory Board meeting to obtain final instructions to move the application. Extensive measures were taken to  103  The draft claim documents in relation to the Fraudulent New Loan Claims found on the Bank’s systems can be found at {I1/46.1} to {I1/46.19}. A comparison between the English translation of the draft claim against Prom Garant Plus and the Fraudulent New Loan Claim which was filed is at {H1/10.13.1}. 104  Seemingly a reference to the issue fee.  \nAA2/1/65\n 60 ensure confidentiality of the meeting and the board’s decision (ibid.). Those measures failed. 146 At 11.48 on Tuesday 19.12.17, when the Bank’s Counsel were making the without notice application before Nugee J, D1 and Granovsky had this exchange: Granovsky “I’m there … Not one …. I’m waiting.” D1 “Chris left with an instruction to submit [the instant claim]. Yesterday the Supervisory Board held a meeting.” Granovsky “Read it… Fuck … I’ll clarify now.” D1 “Instruction: Full ahead! All the members of the Supervisory Board were unanimous … Clarification required.” Granovsky “I’m trying to find out” 105 D1 WhatsApp exchange with Granovsky on 19.12.12 {K5-A1/23/18} 147 The fact that the Supervisory Board’s decision was leaked to D1 within a day is a vivid illustration of the control D1 continued to wield over the Bank post-nationalisation.  D7 The Lafferty Spreadsheets 148 Another such illustration is found in the way the Lafferty Spreadsheets were compiled. Lafferty2, also relied upon by D2 ({G2/23/9}, ¶21 and fn 37-39), said as follows: Since service of the WFO on 20.12.17, D1 and “... a team put together by him have been working hard to establish where the money which is alleged by the Bank to have been misappropriated went (ie the Tracing Exercise). ... that has been a very substantial exercise indeed, and has required the assistance of many individuals.” (¶17; see to similar effect ¶30) D1 and “his representatives” had been in contact with “former employees and clients of the Bank”, who had “provided them with the Bank’s transactional data, relevant information and explanations. Those sources are unwilling to be identified.” (¶18) The transactional data had been “analysed by teams of people engaged by [D1] with relevant IT and bank administration experience.” (¶19) The “teams” included “former employees of the Bank, who were aware of the transaction patterns described below and the companies involved in the Scheme. Those team members were thus able to identify the relevant subset of companies fro"}

Those sources are unwilling to be identified.” (¶18) The transactional data had been “analysed by teams of people engaged by [D1] with relevant IT and bank administration experience.” (¶19) The “teams” included “former employees of the Bank, who were aware of the transaction patterns described below and the companies involved in the Scheme. Those team members were thus able to identify the relevant subset of companies from those for whom data was obtained to conduct the Tracing Exercise effectively.” (¶20) In some cases, the “teams” were only able to conduct the exercise by identifying types of transactions “from their own knowledge (in the case of ex-Bank employees) or from conversations with others in the teams.” (¶21) “In light of the complexity of some of the routes by which the money was returned to the Bank ... it would not have been possible for the person who put the chain together to recall each transaction they put together. ... those Chains have been identified by a process of reconstruction – that is, the teams have identified each chain based on their understanding of the generic way the Scheme operated and the data they have.” (¶24) Extracts from Lafferty2 about D1’s team {H2/8}  105  D1 and Granovsky proceeded to exchange a further 21 messages, most of which are redacted, before the WFO was served on D1 at 17:47 on 20.12.17: Wales1/¶23 {H1/12/6}. \nAA2/1/66\n 61 149 Three key points should be noted:  150 First, D1 did not identify the members of his ‘team’ in Lafferty2, when he gave disclosure in the claim, or when he filed his trial witness statements. He successfully resisted an order that he do so at the 2nd CMC, when he was instead ordered to disclose any documents used to compile the Lafferty Spreadsheets: {A5/15/11} ([37]-[38]). That order produced a nil return, and on 29.3.22 D1 was ordered to provide “the names of the team who prepared the Lafferty Spreadsheets”: {A6/79/3}. When the information was provided, it came as no surprise that Gurieva was the first name on the team sheet {H2/52/3}. As noted above, she was assisted by five former BOK employees. Of the remaining three team members, two were from Primecap. 151 Second, D1 knew exactly whom to approach, viz. those who were “aware of the transaction patterns … and the companies involved in the Scheme” and who “put the chain[s]” together. 152 Third, D1’s team used the Bank’s – stolen – transactional data to compile the Lafferty Spreadsheets. This is what Mr Lafferty says: “… [D1] and his representatives have been in contact with former employees and clients of the Bank who have provided them with the Bank’s transactional data, relevant information and explanations” {H2/8/5} (¶18). D1’s subsequent attempts to claim that the Bank’s transactional data was not used are hopeless and have already been doubted by the Court: {A5/15/11} (¶37). But this is a telling lie. Aside from the criminal offence committed,106 it is further evidence that – post-nationalisation – D1 was able to procure the Bank’s employees to do his bidding.    \n 106  See Beketov8/¶508ff {C1/1/171}; Beketov11/¶265(d) {C9.2/1/102}. \nAA2/1/67\n 62 E WITNESSES AND DISCLOSURE 153 In this Section, the Bank (i) introduces the ten witnesses it will call to give evidence at trial; (ii) addresses the adverse inferences the Court should draw as against the Defendants for their failure to call any factual witness evidence; and (iii) explains in outline D1-2’s failure to give proper disclosure, and the adverse inferences that should be drawn therefrom.

E1 The Bank’s witnesses 154 The Bank’s witnesses are introduced, and their evidence briefly summarised, below. Kateryna Rozhkova Rozhkova is a senior banker with more than 20 years’ experience in public and private institutions in the Ukrainian banking sector.  She joined the NBU in June 2015 as the director of its banking supervision unit, was promoted to Acting Deputy Governor in January 2016, and is now the NBU’s First Deputy Governor.  Rozhkova has produced two statements ({B1/5} and {B1/18}) which (i) explain the reforms to Ukraine’s banking laws and regulations – often mandated by the IMF – between 2014-16, and how those reforms were implemented across the Ukrainian banking sector; (ii) explain how the NBU supervised the Bank over that period (in particular in respect of the Restructuring Plan, Asset Transfer and Transformation); and (iii) reject D1’s allegation that the Bank was nationalised as a result of a political campaign.  Rozhkova’s evidence is that the NBU did all it could to avoid the Bank’s nationalisation and that, when this became a real possibility, D1 started acting in a threatening manner towards her (¶¶215-219). Olena Pogorelaya Pogorelaya is a Bank employee who, prior to nationalisation, worked in the Corporate VIP Business loan department.  Her 13-page statement {B1/8/2} explains that alongside her day to day work she (i) assisted the Bank’s Cyprus branch by finalising and executing loan documentation (typically by providing missing information and then leaving the documents, which were often to be backdated, with Yatsenko’s secretary to arrange for execution by the Bank and/or the purported customer) (¶¶11-26), (ii) was asked to prepare letters on behalf of clients (e.g. purporting to explain why they had failed to repay loans) (¶¶24-27), (iii) was paid to act as a director of one Bank client (the unnamed UBOs of which were said to be based in Cyprus), and (iv) often acted as a shareholder of other bank clients (but did not attend or vote at any of the shareholders’ meetings that were purportedly held by those clients) (¶¶37-51).   She also confirms that she felt she would have lost her job if she had refused to perform a task she had been asked to do, and she could not afford to take that risk (¶22). Dmitry Luchaninov Luchaninov was the head of the Bank’s compliance department. His 20-page witness statement {B1/3/2} explains how (i) certain departments of the Bank were organised pre-nationalisation (¶¶12-18), and (ii) he was given instructions by the Bank’s pre-nationalisation management (including Dubilet, Yatsenko, \nAA2/1/68\n 63 Novikov and Gurieva) to hide the Bank’s affiliations with many of its borrowers (¶¶43-92). The Luchaninov Email has already been mentioned; it is addressed further in ¶284ff below. Marina Lozytska Lozytska was the deputy head of the client banking service department within BOK for 12 years before the Bank’s nationalisation. She remains a Bank employee, albeit in a different department.  Lozytska’s 12-page witness statement {B1/6/2} explains that (i) BOK operated as a segregated division within the Bank, and that its clients were also treated differently (¶¶12-20), (ii) her role included accepting formal documents for the opening of client files, and maintaining those files thereafter (¶¶21-29), and (iii) PBC would often send individuals (including Melnyk) to BOK to provide or sign documentation, with the same individual often attending BOK’s offices in relation to a number of different borrowers (¶¶23, 28, 30-42). Ruslana Domashenko Domashenko was the Bank’s curator from February 2015 onwards. Her 15-page witness statement {B1/14/2} (i) explains her main function as curator (viz. the daily reporting of information to the NBU’s oversight department) (¶¶19-20); (ii) explains that her role was not to instruct or direct the Bank on how to conduct its operations, an"}

Ruslana Domashenko Domashenko was the Bank’s curator from February 2015 onwards. Her 15-page witness statement {B1/14/2} (i) explains her main function as curator (viz. the daily reporting of information to the NBU’s oversight department) (¶¶19-20); (ii) explains that her role was not to instruct or direct the Bank on how to conduct its operations, and nor did she seek to do so (¶¶26-27; 55); (iii) explains her real practical difficulties in interrogating the Bank’s transactions (e.g. because she did not have access to certain basic information from within the Cypriot branch) (¶¶28-39); and (iv) rejects D1’s allegation that she “supervised and controlled” the Transformation (¶¶54-57). Mykhailo Shekmar Shekmar conducted a scheduled inspection of the Bank between 8.2.16 and 1.7.16 and an unscheduled inspection of the Bank between 17.10.16 and 31.12.16. He has more than 17 years’ experience of inspecting Ukrainian banks, and has been involved in more than 100 such inspections in all.  His 21-page witness statement {B1/12/2} (i) explains the manifold problems identified by the scheduled 2016 inspection, including in relation to collateral purportedly provided by supply agreements (¶¶28-38); (ii) rejects D1’s allegation that the Transformation was “supervised and controlled” by Shekmar or his team (¶¶45-61); and (iii) explains that the results of the unscheduled inspection, which was hampered by the Bank’s failure to provide information (e.g. about D1’s withdrawal of UAH6bn from the Bank during 2016 (¶69)), demonstrated the Bank’s insolvency (¶¶62-67). Sergiy Oleksiyenko Oleksiyenko is an experienced financial services professional appointed to the Bank’s Supervisory Board upon nationalisation, a position he continues to hold.  His 17-page statement {B1/10} explains, from a Supervisory Board perspective, (i) the many pressures faced by the Bank in the first half of 2017 (¶¶8-34), (ii) why potential claims against D1-2 started to be investigated seriously in c. August 2017 (¶¶35-58), and (iii) how the decision to institute these proceedings was taken, with an extra degree of security to prevent information leakage (which still failed to prevent the decision being leaked to D1 within c. 24 hours) (¶¶59-62). Galyna Pakhachuk is a former banker who was appointed to the Bank’s Management \nAA2/1/69\n 64 Pakhachuk Board five days after nationalisation, a position she held until 31.8.21. Her 17-page witness statement {B1/1} explains that: (i) the Bank’s new management team had a hugely complex and difficult role to perform in the months after nationalisation (e.g. avoiding a run on the Bank, overcoming the absence/destruction of important documents, building a new organisational structure, dealing with employees who remained loyal to D1-2, investigating wrongdoing, etc.) (¶¶13-44); and (ii) the Bank’s claim was instituted as soon as reasonably practicable (¶¶36-57). Iryna Hryn and Valerii Bondarenko Hryn was, and Bondarenko is, a lawyer in the Bank’s legal department. The purpose of their short evidence, found at {B1/16} and {B1/11}, is to explain that their signatures were forged on 23 unauthorised and fraudulent claims instituted in the name of the Bank in 2017.  E2 The Defendants’ (lack of) trial evidence 155 A key feature of these proceedings is the Defendants’ now complete failure to provide any evidential response to the case against them. Not only have the Defendants failed to serve even written evidence from any of their key associates who were at the very heart of the transactions and events which are in issue in the case (Novikov, Gurieva and Dubilet, to name but a few), but they have now entirely abandoned the written trial evidence that was previously served.

Not only have the Defendants failed to serve even written evidence from any of their key associates who were at the very heart of the transactions and events which are in issue in the case (Novikov, Gurieva and Dubilet, to name but a few), but they have now entirely abandoned the written trial evidence that was previously served. No witness at all will be proffered by them. There will be no attempt to explain the transactions.  Nor will there be any evidence from D1-2’s numerous admitted associates and nominees that they were acting for anyone other than D1-2 throughout. It is instructive to recall how this remarkable situation has arisen: 156 D1-2’s original position during the jurisdictional challenge was that they could provide an exculpatory explanation for what had happened.  Thus D1 (in a position adopted by D2) professed to have knowledge of the “Scheme”, and sought to portray it as a form of ‘no harm done’ loan recycling via the now abandoned Lafferty Spreadsheets. They promised that all that would be explained at trial: {G3/12/8} (28:2-5).  157 When they filed their original Defences in early 2020, D1-2 continued to advance a positive case, based on the Lafferty Spreadsheets, that the Bank had suffered no loss. But they did so with considerable diffidence: while relying on the ‘Scheme’ set out in the Lafferty Spreadsheets, they nevertheless denied any knowledge of the transactions comprising the fraud and made only limited concessions of ownership.107  107  D1Def/¶8(4) {A1/8/7}, ¶14 {A1/8/11}, ¶¶19-19A {A1/8/14}, ¶20 {A1/8/15}, ¶25 {A1/8/19}, ¶30 {A1/8/20}, ¶55C {A1/8/30};  D2Def/¶¶29-30 {A1/18/13-14}, ¶67 {A1/18/31}. \nAA2/1/70\n 65 158 Then came D1-2’s witness statements for trial back in 2021. That evidence was always threadbare (D1’s trial witness statement was only 17 pages, remarkably short for a case of this nature). D1-2 made no attempt to explain or justify the Scheme set out in the Lafferty Spreadsheets (despite D1 having worked hard for months in early 2018 to produce those spreadsheets), or offer any other explanation of their own. However, an (alternative) explanation of sorts was attempted through the remarkable first witness statement of D1-2’s associate Yatsenko.108 This statement, which expressly said that it was “duly authorised … on behalf of [D1]” {B2/4/1} (¶1) purported to explain that under D1-2’s control the Bank routinely used “mock supply agreements”, under which “no supply of goods was expected” to justify the provision of “technical loans” as part of a “service to [the Bank’s] clients which circumvented the requirements to repatriate foreign currency within a specified period of time” {B2/4/6} (¶¶37-47). 159 In March 2022, shortly before the original trial date, D1 served a draft amended Defence which abandoned any reliance on the Lafferty Spreadsheets. When asked to explain his position, he said “[D1] no longer places any reliance on the Lafferty Spreadsheets. In none of his statements of case, nor in his evidence for trial does [D1] describe the features of, or advance any positive case of, the existence of any scheme” {A2/31.7/2} (¶1). 160 At the March 2023 PTR, D2’s Leading Counsel announced that D2 would not be giving evidence at trial {G3/43/3} (6:9-11); that revelation came despite repeated confirmations in 2022 that D2 intended to give evidence in person, and despite D2 relying upon this intention in support of the Defendants’ (successful) application to adjourn the trial in March 2022.109 D1, for his part, hedged his bets as to whether or not he intended to give evidence,110 keeping that option alive as recently as the March 2023 PTR, when he applied (and was granted) permission to give evidence by video link. He maintained that position until 18.5.23, less than three weeks before the start of trial, when he abruptly announced that he would tender no evidence. 161 D1-2 have proffered no explanation for their decisions to withdraw all evidence.

He maintained that position until 18.5.23, less than three weeks before the start of trial, when he abruptly announced that he would tender no evidence. 161 D1-2 have proffered no explanation for their decisions to withdraw all evidence.  However, the reasons are obvious: disclosure extracted from D1-2 over the past 15 months reveals that their attempts to distance themselves from the Misappropriation, from the individuals and vehicles that participated in it, and from the operations of the Bank are all false.  Had they given evidence, D1 would have had to explain basic information such as his case on  108  D1 also provided short statements from Medvedev (who worked under Novikov in the Bank’s Investment Business department) and Zavadetskyi (a lawyer who was head of a ‘Special Monitoring Unit’ at the NBU). 109  See, for example, {PTR-A/5/10} (¶23(1)(b); Enyo (23.9.22) {L/102/1} (¶3).  110  See, for example, {PTR-A/4/17} (¶¶39, 54(4)); Lafferty16/¶58(b) {PTR-B4/3/12}.  \nAA2/1/71\n 66 the commercial rationale of the “Scheme” which his solicitor addressed in detail in March 2018{H2/8/1} (¶¶11, 13, 17-21), and D2 why he professed to have little involvement with the running of the Bank despite attending nearly 200 Supervisory Board meetings between 2013-16 and being in frequent contact with Dubilet, the Chair of the Management Board.  Yatsenko, for his part, would have had to explain his role in approving the Relevant Loans; his evidence that the Bank routinely granted “technical” (sc. sham) loans; and his admission that the Bank’s customers (sc. D1-2) used “mock supply agreements” to circumvent restrictions on the movement of foreign currency (as to which see ¶229 below).  (1) Adverse inferences to be drawn from D1-2’s refusal to give evidence and withdrawal of their witness statement for trial 162 The leading judgment on the drawing of adverse inferences from the absence of a witness is that of Lord Leggatt JSC in Efobi v Royal Mail Group Ltd [2021] 1 WLR 3863 at [41]: “The question whether an adverse inference may be drawn from the absence of a witness is sometimes treated as a matter governed by legal criteria …. … I think there is a risk of making overly legal and technical what really is or ought to be just a matter of ordinary rationality. So far as possible, tribunals should be free to draw, or to decline to draw, inferences from the facts of the case before them using their common sense without the need to consult law books when doing so. Whether any positive significance should be attached to the fact that a person has not given evidence depends entirely on the context and particular circumstances. Relevant considerations will naturally include [1] such matters as whether the witness was available to give evidence, [2] what relevant evidence it is reasonable to expect that the witness would have been able to give, [3] what other relevant evidence there was bearing on the point(s) on which the witness could potentially have given relevant evidence, and [4] the significance of those points in the context of the case as a whole.

{"start": 199500, "text": "s.” 163 In this case, as a matter of “common sense” it is quite clear that D1-2 have chosen to deprive the Bank of the opportunity to cross-examine them (and their associates) because D1-2 would be exposed as liars and fraudsters, and the Bank’s case that they perpetrated the Misappropriation though their associates and owned and controlled all the companies involved in it through their nominees would have been confirmed.  164 As to Lord Leggatt’s four criteria, and dealing first with D1-2 themselves: (1) Both D1 and D2 were plainly able to give evidence. D2 told the Court that he would do so in 2022, and nothing has changed. As for D1, at the March 2023 PTR he applied for, and was granted, permission to give evidence by video link; he subsequently gave a witness statement confirmed his “willing[ness] to travel to the Fairmont Grand Hotel in Kyiv … to give my evidence at Trial” {H2/62/7} (¶7(a)). (2) D1-2’s evidence should have covered all aspects of the claim made against them (such as their control over the Bank, their ownership and control over (inter alia) the \nAA2/1/72\n 67 Borrowers and D3-8, and their knowledge of and involvement in the Misappropriation). It was obviously reasonable to expect D1-2 to address these issues. Indeed, innocent men would typically be anxious to give their side of the story to clear their name.  (3) The other evidence bearing on D1-2’s liability is addressed across these opening submissions and presents an overwhelming inferential case. But should the Court have any doubts on particular issues, perhaps as a result of D1-2s deficient disclosure of material from 2013-2014 (see below), it should draw appropriate adverse inferences against D1-2.  (4) The points on which D1-2 could have given evidence are of obvious significance to the case against them.  165 Adverse inferences should also be drawn against D1 for his failure to call Yatsenko, Medvedev and Zavadetskyi, despite filing trial witness statements from all three. The four criteria are also plainly satisfied for these withdrawn witnesses: (1) No suggestion has been made that any one of them was unable to give evidence. Indeed, as late as 10.3.23, D1 confirmed in correspondence that all three were “able to travel to the UK, subject only to obtaining the necessary visas”{PTR2-F1/23/1}. No problem in obtaining such visas has been identified and all of the Bank’s witnesses have been able to obtain visas to allow them to the travel to the UK. (2) Yatsenko, as a former member of the Bank’s Management Board and ECC, a recipient of the Luchaninov Email and a key lieutenant of D1-2, could reasonably have been expected to give evidence covering, inter alia, the approval and grant of the Relevant Loans, D1-2’s control of the Bank’s operations, the Bank’s approach to concealing related party lending, the Asset Transfer, the Transformation and (as noted above) his suggestion that sham supply agreements were used to circumvent restrictions on the movement of foreign currency.  Medvedev, as a former employee of the Investment Business and deputy to Novikov, could have given evidence on the operations of that department and its interactions with PBC; Zavadetskyi as to the conduct of the NBU in 2015 and D1’s allegation that the Bank, under D1-2’s ownership, was treated differently to others (which allegation has been thoroughly rebutted by the Bank’s witnesses). (3) The other evidence bearing on these issues is addressed throughout these submissions. Once again, it overwhelmingly supports the Bank’s case on all of these \nAA2/1/73\n 68 topics; but insofar as there is any room for doubt, the Court should draw adverse inferences against D1. (4) The points on which Yatsenko, Medvedev and Zavadetskyi could have given evidence are, again, of obvious significance.   (2) D1-2 have failed to adduce witness evidence from key lieutenants 166 Further adverse inferences should also be drawn against D1-2 given their failure to adduce evidence from any of the key lieutenan"}

(4) The points on which Yatsenko, Medvedev and Zavadetskyi could have given evidence are, again, of obvious significance.   (2) D1-2 have failed to adduce witness evidence from key lieutenants 166 Further adverse inferences should also be drawn against D1-2 given their failure to adduce evidence from any of the key lieutenants they used to organise and perpetrate the Misappropriation, notwithstanding D1-2’s ongoing relationship with such lieutenants and (for some) their deployment at earlier stages of the litigation. In particular: Oleksandr Dubilet Dubilet’s relevance, and D1-2’s ability to call him, is obvious: (1) He was the pre-nationalisation Chair of the Management Board.  (2) Dubilet was the person who D1 says was responsible for “the decisions made by the Bank to grant loans”, “the terms of the loans, including the security to be required for them”, “the compilation of the Bank’s lists of related parties” and the approval of the Transformation Plan {A1/8/4} (¶7(2)(i), (iv), (vi)). D2 pleads that the Bank was controlled by the Management Board and “[Dubilet] had specific authority to act on behalf of the Bank and carry out operational management of the Management Board’s activities” {A1/18/10} (¶¶20, 22).  (3) Dubilet signed 115 of the Relevant Loan agreements and chaired the ECC at which each of the Relevant Loans was authorised. (4) See further ¶117ff above. Timur Novikov Novikov’s importance and close relationship with D1-2 has already been addressed at ¶73ff above. It should further be noted that Novikov has previously been willing and available to give evidence for D1 e.g. in the Pinchuk Proceedings (Terry6/¶9(a) {I3/15/3}).   Tatiana Gurieva Again, Gurieva is of obvious importance: see ¶121ff above. She was the Head of BOK, from which the loans to 46 of the Borrowers originated, and she approved 129 of the Relevant Loans as a member of the ECC. The eponymous spreadsheet was found on Gurieva’s laptop. And she led the team who prepared the Lafferty Spreadsheets. Slava Anischenko and Sergei Melnyk  See ¶78ff and ¶91ff respectively. 167 This quintet could also have all given highly relevant evidence about the Misappropriation and D1-2’s involvement in it. The Court should draw the inference that they have been kept away from the witness box because their answers in cross-examination would have supported the Bank’s case as to D1-2’s ownership and control of the Bank and other \nAA2/1/74\n 69 relevant entities and involvement in the Misappropriation. 168 The same is true for individuals who worked at the Bank and were willing to give evidence on D1’s behalf in these proceedings in 2018 (safe in the knowledge that the Bank would not have an opportunity to test that evidence in cross-examination at that stage). They include: Alexey Kazantsev Kazantsev worked at the Bank from 2002 until 4.4.18. He was an employee of BOK at the time of the Bank’s nationalisation, holding the position of Deputy Head of the Customer Credit Department. He gave written evidence in 2018 {H2/10}. The relevance of Kazantsev’s evidence, in a case involving sham lending from BOK which was not repaid, is obvious, but it is doubly relevant when one considers that he was also the keeper of the Kazantsev Spreadsheets, by which the outstanding prepayments were tracked on a daily basis. Olga Koryak Koryak was another long-serving employee of BOK (2003-16) where she was head of the legal support department and “co-ordinator for matters relating to inspections and enquiries”: Koryak1/¶1.2 {H2/7/2}. But D1 has not called her to give evidence about how BOK worked in practice or why the Relevant Loans were granted. Maxim Pugach Pugach worked at the Bank from 2001 until 31.3.17 and was the Bank’s Deputy Head of Information Technology from 2015, responsible for “reporting systems, department m"}

But D1 has not called her to give evidence about how BOK worked in practice or why the Relevant Loans were granted. Maxim Pugach Pugach worked at the Bank from 2001 until 31.3.17 and was the Bank’s Deputy Head of Information Technology from 2015, responsible for “reporting systems, department management and data administration”: Pugach1/¶¶1.1-1.2 {H2/6/1-2}. Pugach1 provided a detailed rebuttal to the Bank’s allegation of document destruction – which has hampered the Bank’s ability to investigate the Misappropriation – in support of D1-2’s WFO set-aside and jurisdiction applications {H2/6}, but he has not been tendered as a witness at trial. Notably, D2, who expressly relied upon evidence filed on behalf of D1 in 2018 {G2/23/2} (¶4), now seeks to resile from it in support of his eleventh-hour attempt to suggest that the Bank's transactional data may have been tampered with (Pugach having described the relevant database as being “read-only”: {H2/6/7} (¶12.2.1)). (3) D3-D8’s failure to adduce any witness evidence  169 Section G(2) below outlines the overwhelming evidence that demonstrates that D3-8 were and are owned and controlled by D1-2. An adverse inference should be drawn against D3-8 as well as D1-2, given that they have failed to adduce evidence from any witness whatsoever.  This is particularly revealing for the following reasons: 170 First, D3-5 claim that Melnyk is their UBO. 171 Second, D3-5 claim that their UBOs are funding this litigation, to the tune of tens of millions of pounds. But none of those supposed UBOs is prepared to come forward and explain why D3-5 entered into the Supply Agreements, why D3-8 brought the Defamation Proceedings (defined and discussed at ¶335ff below) in Ukraine in 2017, or why they are spending so much money defending companies who seemingly have no business or assets. \nAA2/1/75\n 70 The reality, of course, as the Sanderlyn and Versala WhatsApp messages lay bare (¶349 below), is that the money is coming from D1-2.  172 Third, highly conveniently, the directors of D3-8 at the time of the Misappropriation all resigned following the Court of Appeal’s decision allowing the Bank’s claim to proceed in England. Tsitsekkos, a director of D4 since 27.4.07, was the first to go; his resignation on 10.10.19 came the day after the Court of Appeal’s decision was circulated in draft. The other directors followed suit in March 2020. The result was that D3-8’s disclosure certificates are so hedged with qualifications that they are practically meaningless. They each say:111 “I am the appropriate person to sign this certificate as I am the only statutory director of [the relevant] Defendant. However, in so signing I cannot confirm that I have received all the confirmations envisaged in the text above this box, for the reasons set out herein below.” “I became Company’s director on [5][18] March 2020. I therefore do not have direct knowledge of the subject matter of these proceedings or of the circumstances in which relevant documents may have been originally created, sent or received.” 173 Fourth, D6-8’s case is that they are owned by Kiperman, Romanovsky and Trykulych respectively; they entered the RSAs on “an arm’s length and commercial basis” on the basis they would supply/procure the supply of oil; and they were “active in the oil markets in 2012-2016”.112 Yet nobody is prepared to come to Court and explain any of that on their behalf. E3 D1-2’s deficient disclosure 174 The Court has recently observed that: “[t]here has been much about [D1’s] approach to disclosure which the bank would be justified in describing as akin to squeezing blood out of a stone and is far removed from compliance with [D1’s] obligations to co-operate with the court in furthering the overriding objective” {A5/27/13} (¶42). That d"}

E3 D1-2’s deficient disclosure 174 The Court has recently observed that: “[t]here has been much about [D1’s] approach to disclosure which the bank would be justified in describing as akin to squeezing blood out of a stone and is far removed from compliance with [D1’s] obligations to co-operate with the court in furthering the overriding objective” {A5/27/13} (¶42). That description applies with equal force to both D1 and D2. The Court has made five specific disclosure orders against D1 since 25.6.21 and it has also made three such orders against D2 (for a summary, see Schedule 1). In addition, three of the D1 orders relate to the joint D1-2 Primecap disclosure exercise, the glacial progress of which is set out in Schedule 2). Even now, D1 has produced not a single document from his own sources covering the key 2013-14 period; D2 has only produced 164. As explained below, there is no plausible justification for this, given that D1-2 have been involved in English litigation for more than a decade. 175 D1’s modus operandi. D1 is a man who, by his own admission, “consciously and actively restrict[s] the volume of documents he has created and handled”, has not “used his desktop computers to store or create  111  See {A4/34/3, 5}, {A4/36/3, 5}, {A4/38/3, 5}, {A4/40/3, 5}, {A4/42/3, 5} and {A4/44/3, 5}. 112  D3-8Def/¶19 {A1/20/11}; D3-8 RRFI/¶11(b) {A2/40/11}. \nAA2/1/76\n 71 any electronic documents”, does not use (“and has never used”) a personal email account because he “does not consider email to be a safe and reliable method of communication”, and whose “practice” has been to dispose of hard copy documents “immediately or once any action points have been completed”.113  176 But D1’s own account of his restrictive approach to generating documents does not tell the whole story. Despite his purported aversion to email, D1 was a prolific user of instant messages, having disclosed over 2,000 messages from the year following nationalisation. However, for the three years prior to nationalisation, he has disclosed nothing like that number (and those that have been disclosed are heavy with redactions); and there is nothing from 2013-14. Even the post-nationalisation instant message chats that D1 has disclosed are demonstrably incomplete, including in respect of important messages disclosed by D2 but not by D1. D1’s solicitors are unable to offer any explanation for these gaps.114 177 D2’s modus operandi. D2’s disclosure certificate reveals that he too took steps to limit the documentary records he generated and kept. And his disclosure of what remains (especially instant messages) has been similarly late, piecemeal and materially incomplete. One key reason for this dearth of material is found in D2’s statement that “Except for his current iPhone, [D2] no longer has any previously used phones in his possession …. [D2’s] long-standing practice is to get a new iPhone every time a new model is released and to give his old iPhone away. … It is understood that [D2’s] current iPhone (an iPhone 12 Pro Max) holds data … dating back to July 2017”.115 Another, as is explained below, is D2’s remarkable (claimed) inability to access his own email accounts. 178 Litigation hold.116 D1-2 have been involved in English litigation since early 2013 and have been under an obligation to preserve all potentially relevant documents (save between January 2016, when the Pinchuk Proceedings ended, and 22.3.16, when the Tatneft Proceedings commenced).117 As to this: (1) D1 cynically took advantage of the 2-month hiatus between the Pinchuk and Tatneft Proceedings to procure his solicitors, on 9.3.16, to “… provide a deletion instruction to  113  Schedule to D1’s Disclosure Certificate {A4/22/10} (¶¶2.1.4, 2.2.16, 2.3.1, 2.4.1). 114  Fieldfisher (28.10.22, 3rd) {L/108/5} stated that “[o]ur client is not a technical expert and cannot offer any in"}

Before the introduction of PD51U in 2019, it was contained in PD31B/¶7.  117  The Pinchuk Proceedings were instituted against D1-2 around the start of April 2013 {I3/13/51}and settled in January 2016 {A4/33/11} (¶2.2.12). The Tatneft Proceedings were instituted on or around 22.3.16 {I3/36/2}and went to trial in late 2020. And the Shulman Proceedings were issued against D1-2 on 12.5.17 and continued until at least February 2018: [2018] EWHC 160 (Ch). \nAA2/1/77\n 72 AlixPartners [his disclosure provider in the Pinchuk Proceedings]” {A4/22/11} (¶2.2.13). This had the effect of deleting material from (inter alia) two of D1’s mobile phones which had been imaged in about June 2014 (ibid., ¶2.2.8). (2) If D2 replaced his iPhone each time a new model was released, D2 must have disposed of at least four mobile phones during periods when litigation holds should have been in place: in 2016 (i.e. during the Tatneft Proceedings); in 2017 (i.e. when Tatneft and Shulman Proceedings were pending); in 2018 and in 2019 (i.e. when the Tatneft Proceedings and the current claim were pending). D2’s iPhone 12 Pro Max, the device searched for his disclosure exercise, was released in autumn 2020.118  Having failed to mention it in his Section 2 DRD or Disclosure Certificates, when questioned, D2 has also recently confirmed that he disposed of an HTC device that he had used in 2014 prior to his document collection in the Tatneft Proceedings.119 179 Instant messages. D1-2 are prolific users of WhatsApp. However, D1-2’s disclosure of instant messages has been anything but straightforward. As for D1: 18.6.21 D1 disclosed 26 chains of WhatsApp messages. Three of them – containing messages with NBU officials – were entirely unredacted (because D1 seems to think they help his case). Of the remaining 23 chains, comprising c. 6,209 messages, only 272 messages were unredacted. In addition, no information was given in five cases as to the identity of D1’s correspondent (initially, even D2’s identity was not disclosed); and in another 12 cases, the correspondent was pseudonymous/unclear (e.g. “Gold”, “Mini Me”). 2.12.21 D1’s solicitors said in correspondence: “As we have said now on numerous occasions, all relevant and disclosable messages have been disclosed” {PTR-B1/4.1/50}). 16.2.22 The Bank issued a specific disclosure application in relation to D1’s application of redactions to WhatsApp messages {G1/63}. 8.3.22 D1’s solicitors (following a re-review) disclosed an additional 150 WhatsApp messages in whole or in part {PTR-B1/7/2}. 11.4.22 The Court ordered D1’s solicitors to conduct a further re-review of D1’s WhatsApp messages. It observed that D1’s solicitors had “adopted an approach to relevance which was too narrow”, that it was “surprising” that over 99.5% of D1’s messages with Novikov were “said not to relate to any issue in the proceedings”, and that there “has or may have been a failure adequately to comply with an order for extended disclosure” {A5/20} (¶¶18, 32, 34). 10.6.22 D1 produced or re-produced 55 WhatsApp chats, including 39 previously undisclosed chats, including (i) five chats bet"}

In total, over 3,200 messages were unredacted or disclosed for the first time, an increase of c. 2,800 messages. Further detail is found in Wales18/¶6 {CMC-B2/3/2}. 180 D2’s disclosure of instant messages has been no better. D2 initially disclosed no WhatsApp messages whatsoever {PTR-B1/11/8} (¶25). After the Bank’s 16.2.22 application was made, D2’s solicitors accepted that this was as a result of an “unduly restrictive” approach, for which they apologised {PTR-B1/13/10} (¶¶27, 29). The upshot, after a further four extensions of time {CMC-B2/3/2} (¶5), was D2’s disclosure of nine WhatsApp chats with D1 (1,342 fully unredacted messages); an 82-page chat with Mr Novikov (352 fully unredacted messages); and five other shorter chats. In addition, hundreds of pages of chats between D2 and Anischenko (598 unredacted messages), together with many hundreds more pages of messages between Anischenko and Novikov, Marangos, Markova and Burkhan (PBC) were also disclosed. 181 ‘The Black’. D1-2 have admitted to using a secure VoIP phone line for sensitive communications – referred to in their instant messages as ‘the Black’ (e.g. {K5-A1/7/37}). According to both D1-2, ‘the Black’ does not produce disclosable records (such as a list of all calls placed on it). This leaves a substantial body of communication between D1-2, and by D1-2 with their inner circle, outside the scope of documentary evidence. 182 On 14.12.22, D2 disclosed a directory for ‘the Black’ dated 27.1.13 {K5-E/2}, with a further undated but later directory emerging on 7.3.23 {K5-E/3}, despite D2’s solicitors having given evidence that the first was “the only phone directory for the IP phone system within his possession” {H3/22/14} (¶75). The directories are significant documents: (1) Novikov, Dubilet, Gurieva, Chmona and Anischenko have entries on both lists;  the second list includes Marangos and Melnyk, and also the purported UBOs of D6-8 (Romanovskyi and Kiperman).  (2) The second list also includes various references to a “new office” in Geneva. Importantly, D1 and D2 both have extension numbers for “Geneva work, new office” {K5-E/3/1-2}. Given that this list dates from (at the earliest) April 2017,120 this is strong evidence that D1-2 established a shared office in Geneva in around 2016. This is further supported by Novikov’s 20.10.16 request for approval of a payment  120  Anischenko has a Geneva “work” extension number {K5-E/3/4}. His evidence in the Shulman Proceedings was that he moved to Geneva with D2 in April 2017 {I3/23/2} (¶3).  \nAA2/1/79\n 74 in respect of “… Primecap taxes and social insur., lease of Geneva office” {K5-A1/42/4}. (3) The second (post-April 2017) list includes extension numbers for Dubilet, Novikov, Anischenko and Chmona in Geneva (there are no equivalent entries in the 27.1.13 list). They went there to work with D1-2, probably after the Bank’s nationalisation.   (4) Remarkably, evidence given on D2’s behalf for an interlocutory hearing states that Kiperman, his “friend” and the purported UBO of D7, created this system but has “refused to provide [D2] with any information about [it]” {H3/22/14} (¶78).  183 D1 has not disclosed an"}

His continued failure to disclose directories for a telephone system set up to allow him and D2 to communicate with their inner sanctum is extraordinary; it simply cannot be the case, as was suggested in January 2023 {G3/41/43} (168:25ff), that D1 was provided with the relevant extension number every time he wanted to place a call.  184 D2’s email accounts. D2’s disclosure statement does not identify the names of any of D2’s email accounts, but does refer to “[t]wo Google Mail accounts” imaged for the purpose of the Pinchuk Proceedings on 26.6.14 {A4/32/6} and “[t]wo old Google Mail accounts” which were not imaged in 2014 (because “the passwords were not known to [D2]” {A4/32/9}). The Bank’s considerable attempts to obtain disclosure from the “[t]wo Google Mail accounts”, and indeed from two further initially undisclosed accounts, have met with limited success. D2 has adopted an obstructive stance and repeatedly made false statements as to his use of and ability to recollect login details for his emails. In summary:  (1) D2 claimed to have forgotten his passwords to the “[t]wo Google Mail accounts” but did not seek assistance from Google: {H3/11/10} (¶37). The Court therefore directed D2 to execute a mandate directing Google to provide D2’s solicitors with relevant emails, so that the Bank could apply for an order against Google (¶8) {A6/63/3}. Google subsequently provided 1,197 emails from the gbb2001@gmail.com account spanning 12.10.11 to 30.8.21, and 8,152 emails from the gennadiy.bb@gmail.com account spanning 25.2.16 to 27.9.21 {L/52}.  (2) The absence of any emails pre-dating 25.2.16 from the gennadiy.bb@gmail.com account, the main account used by D2 over this period, suggests intentional deletion: (i) the Bank has 44 examples of emails from that account (obtained from other sources) pre-dating 25.2.16; and (ii) the 25.2.16 start date falls in the hiatus between the end of the Pinchuk Proceedings and the start of the Tatneft Proceedings (i.e. the \nAA2/1/80\n 75 same window D1 used to give deletion instructions to AlixPartners).  (3) A remarkable feature of this exercise, which cannot now be explored in evidence with D2, is how D2 forgot all of his log-in details to four sets of Gmail accounts. Indeed, the position in relation to the gennadiy.bb@gmail.com account is farcical: (i) in 2018 and 2019, D2 and Anischenko were using this address and included it in an agency agreement with Primecap: {E17/246} {E17/267} {E17/268/6}; (ii) the account contains 2,654 emails from 2019-20 (i.e.  it was still in active use years after these proceedings started); (iii) D2 registered a new phone number to the account in June 2017; and (iv) D2 is known to have logged onto the account (presumably using his password) in January and February 2019 {L/64/2}.  (4) Further still, recovery information provided by Google for gennadiy.bb@gmail.com shows that D2 had given gennadiy.bb@gbbmail.com as the recovery email address. This address had never been mentioned by D2 and, when asked about it, he said that (i) it had been created by Primecap for him to “facilitate secure communication between [D2] and his legal team during the Pinchuk Proceedings” and was of “limited usage”; (ii) he ceased using it by mid-2016 when the Pinchuk proceedings ended; (iii) no backu"}

(5) But that explanation does not withstand even cursory analysis: (a) If gennadiy.bb@gbbmail.com served such a limited purpose, why did D2 give it to Google as the “recovery email” for gennadiy.bb@gmail.com? (b) On 11.3.15, an Allen Green sent a message to D2’s gbbmail.com address. Headed “URGENT TRANSFER TO CUBA”, Mr Green sought D2’s help in arranging the transfer of €3m, because the “Americans … are scaring away all banks doing business with Cuba” {E8/75}. D2 forwarded the email to Dubilet within an hour of receipt, who made the necessary enquiries of Morgachov.121 This is all entirely unrelated to the Pinchuk Proceedings. (c) On 21.4.17, i.e. 15 months after the Pinchuk Proceedings concluded, D2 received an email from Distergov to his gbbmail.com address with the  121  It appears Mr Green made further requests for payments to Cuba later in 2015 at which point the individual making the request was described as “Singapore-based Kolomoisky’s partner who wants to pay to Cuba” and “he can never be ignored, he is not a bad guy, but his boss, Allen Green, is untouchable”: {K6/9/1}. \nAA2/1/81\n 76 subject line “Holiday Apartments Split”.122 Another email was sent to D2’s gbbmail.com address on 12.5.17, this time from a Cypriot CSP, relating to the potential sale of Olbia/Hotel Split.123 (6) A yet further address (gbb2001@mail.ru) was also identified as a “recovery email”{PTR-B6/2/479}. When pressed, it was initially said by D2’s solicitors that “The email gbb2001@mail.ru was identified during the document collection process, however it was only available in the following redacted form: gb*****@ma**.**. Inquiries were made of [D2] at that time and he was unable to recall the address in full.” {PTR-B6/2/479}. But D2 then changed his stance, brazenly asserting that “It also appears that [the gbb2001@mail.ru address] never existed” {L/65} (¶5) and “… [D2] does not recall why he included these details in the subscriber information” {L/75.1/2} (¶2.4). This is nonsense: if the address did not exist, it would not have been provided to Google, D2 would not have been asked about it earlier in his disclosure exercise, and D2 would not have responded that “he was unable to recall the address in full”. (7) D2’s forgetfulness is not limited to his six email accounts. He first said that he was unable to access his Apple iCloud account because he “could not remember the device nor phone number to which the account was associated” before stating that he had never used iCloud.124 It beggars belief that a successful businessman could forget so many accounts, passwords and email addresses.  185 Primecap. The Court is familiar with the extraordinarily protracted disclosure exercise carried out by D1 (for himself and D2)125 over Primecap’s documents. A short chronology, which amply bears out the Court’s ‘blood from a stone’ observation, is in Schedule 2.  186 PBC. Neither D1 nor D2 proposed PBC as a custodian in their DRD or mentioned PBC in their early Disclosure Certificates, although as explained at Section E(3) above, it must have been clear to both of them that PBC held relevant documents. It was instead the Bank, once it had figured out the central role PBC played, which raised disclosure of its documents on  122  {E17/153.1}, attaching {E17/153"}

The email was copied to Distergov, Novikov and Balu Chainrai. 124  See Enyo (16.6.22) {L/75.1/3} (¶2.8, “both Ankura and Mr Bogolyubov made several attempts to access our client’s iCloud account, but these were unsuccessful”), Hogan Lovells (19.7.22) {L/83.1/3} (¶2.6), Enyo 26.9.22 {L/98.1/2} (¶5, “our client has confirmed that he never knowingly used iCloud”), Enyo (16.11.22) {L/110.1/3} (¶4.2, “our client does not have an iCloud account associated with his device”). 125  When challenged by the Bank’s solicitors whether, in the face of D1’s glacial progress in completing aspects of D2’s disclosure on his behalf, D2 continued to be comfortable delegating all that he has delegated to D1 {L/71.2/7} (¶6.15(a)), D2’s solicitors simply stated that “the joint approach taken by the First and Second Defendant was and continues to be the most efficient and proportionate” {L/75.1/4} (¶5.3).  Almost a year later, D1 continues to disclose documents held by Primecap on D2’s behalf, most recently 2,069 documents on 12 May 2023. \nAA2/1/82\n 77 23.12.21 {TR1-C2/6/5}. That led to D1’s solicitors writing to PBC to request documents on 7.2.22, to which no substantive response was received until 28.7.22: Wright5/¶14 {TR1-C2/5/3}.  187 Even allowing for the Russian invasion, this is further dilatory and unacceptable conduct: (i) PBC, as the employer of D1-2’s agents who hold assets for them, should have been issued with a litigation hold instruction after the proceedings started; (ii) it should have been approached in 2020, in time for the 9.4.21 disclosure deadline; and (iii) when the Bank identified the significance of PBC in December 2021, D1-2 should personally have contacted Melnyk and insisted he produce the documents in short order.  188 D1 belatedly gave some disclosure of PBC documents in late 2022: Wright5/¶15 {H2/54.2/3}. But the disclosure has been limited: the same company that operates Primecap’s IT systems and hosts the domains for hundreds of D1-2 companies – also responsible for deleting D2’s gbbmail.com domain – has explained that “PBC’s entire email server along with its backup copies no longer exist” {H4/34/5}. 189 Selective disclosure. The only unredacted WhatsApp messages that were initially disclosed by D1 were those he exchanged with NBU officials, doubtless in an attempt to support his political conspiracy case. It is symptomatic of a more general self-serving and selective approach to disclosure.  For example, on 24.11.21, the Bank’s valuation expert filed a report concluding that the petrol stations transferred as part of the Asset Transfer were overvalued and the fuel volume data (produced to valuers in 2016) was unreliable.126 On 20.1.22 and 20.2.22, D1 disclosed for the first time 245 single-page images of spreadsheets from 50 identified custodians which are said to contain reliable monthly sales volumes for the petrol stations (see ¶600 below). D1’s valuation expert filed his report a day after the second tranche was disclosed, on 21.2.22, and relied on these spreadsheets to support far higher valuations of the petrol stations.127 Remarkably, the spreadsheets (i) contained no original metadata; and (ii) were produced by custodians from which no other documents had previously, or have subsequently, been disclosed (save for two exceptions).128 190 The Court was right to describe D1’s disclosure efforts as akin to drawing blood out of a stone.

D1-2’s conduct is deserving of an adverse inference being drawn against them:129 they knew perfectly well about the Misappropriation which was being carried out by their lieutenants, at their behest and for their benefit, and their approach to disclosure was designed to frustrate the ability of the Bank – and of the Court – to ascertain the role they played in it.    \n 129  See further Matthews and Malek on Disclosure (5th ed.), ¶17.38. \nAA2/1/84\n 79 F THE MISAPPROPRIATION 191 The essential nature and key features of the Misappropriation have already been outlined in Section A above. In this Section, the Bank explains in further detail how the core components of the Misappropriation operated.  F1 The Relevant Loans 192 Between 3.4.13 and 21.8.14, the Bank entered into a total of 134 Relevant Loans with 50 Borrowers.130 Approval for each of them was given by the Bank’s ECC, and the loan agreements were signed on behalf of the Bank by one of Dubilet (in the majority of instances), Pikush, Yatsenko or Morgachov. The Borrowers called upon those Relevant Loans – which purported to be revolving credit facilities granted in either US$ or UAH, ranging in value from c. US$3.7m to US$59.5m – to make 270 Relevant Drawdowns, totalling US$2.33bn (UAH 8.8bn and US$1.5bn).131 193 None of the Relevant Loans constituted genuine or proper lending. Rather, each was a sham, designed to facilitate the extraction of monies from the Bank under the guise of an apparently legitimate transaction; the Borrowers were all shell companies, under the ownership and/or control of D1-2, used to obtain and launder the funds; and the loans were granted on terms that were patently uncommercial, pursuant to a process designed to rubber stamp, and not scrutinise, the proposed lending. 194 As particularised in detail in the Borrower SOFs {F1/2} to {F1/51}, the Relevant Loans possessed the following common features: (1) Borrowers’ lack of substance   195 None of the 50 Borrowers had any proper credit or trading history, or business activities that would allow them to service (let alone repay) loans worth many millions of US$. For example, the contemporaneous documents show that: (1) The Borrowers’ financial statements record that (i) 31 Borrowers were balance sheet insolvent at all times, (ii) nine Borrowers were balance sheet insolvent in one or more trading periods,132 and (iii) eight Borrowers which were not balance sheet insolvent nevertheless recorded net losses in some or all of the periods covered.133 Financial statements have not been located in respect of the two remaining  130  For a list of the Relevant Loans, see Thompson1/App. 3-3-6 {D1/105}. 131  See PoC ¶¶17(a), 17A(a) {A1/2/7}; Thompson1/¶3.2 {D1/1/27}, ¶3.21 {D1/1/38}; Table 3-1 {D1/1/38}. 132  Faboris, Mastein, Milorin, Nautis-Trade, Orbela, Ortika, Ribotto, Saltiz and Viitella. 133  Celastrina, Elsis Time, Empire, Esmola, Fiastra, Intorno, Tamersa and Uniks. \nAA2/1/85\n 80 Borrowers.134  (2) 36 of th"}

And where information was provided, it was usually meaningless (e.g. Tseris recorded its sales as “3000” without indicating the currency; Vegatorg similarly recorded its sales as “20,665”).136  (4) 42 of the 50 Borrowers were recorded as having just one employee, seven as having two employees,137 and one provided no employee information at all.138  (5) The Borrowers almost universally described their business activities in generic and indistinct terms, a typical example being “non-specialised wholesale trade”.139  (6) The purpose for which the Relevant Loan was sought was often not specified. Where a purpose was given, it was almost always said to be the generic “[f]inancing of the Company’s current activities”.140  Similarly, where the “source of repayment” was specified (which was not always the case), it was almost always said to be from the company’s “main activity”.141 (7) Where “Technical and Economic Feasibility Studies” (i.e. business plans) have been found in relation to Borrowers, those documents predicted estimated sales revenue that bore no relation to their financial statements at the time lending was granted.  For example, Esmola’s business plan estimated that the company would have sales revenue of UAH 295m in 2014, 29,500 times the revenue of UAH 10,000 recorded in its financial statement for Q1-Q4 of 2013.142  134  Cambel and Real-Standart.

In summary:  (1) The 32 purported beneficial owners of the Borrowers were – with only five exceptions143 – PBC or Bank employees who are admitted nominees for D1-2.  Further, the directors of 35 of the Borrowers were PBC employees and admitted D1-2 nominees.  (2) The Luchaninov and Rokoman Emails (and similar documents addressed at ¶283ff below) demonstrate that the PBC nominees acted as a fungible pool of individuals who could be (and were) removed and replaced at the instigation of individuals at the Bank: the only credible explanation for this is that the Borrowers and the Bank were under common owne"}

(3) The Borrowers were given instructions by Bank employees (typically within BOK), PBC and Primecap, each of which was owned and controlled by D1-2. (4) D1-2 have been forced to admit ownership of an increasingly large number of Borrowers: they now admit interests in 21 (D1) and 19 (D2) of the 50 Borrowers.144 (5) The Borrowers were all under common ownership/control and participated in the Misappropriation in a uniform manner; the Relevant Loans (all concluded on very similar terms) were secured by purported Share Pledges granted by and over D1-2’s companies; and the vast majority of the Relevant Loans were purportedly repaid by further D1-2 companies/assets (via the Intermediary Loans, Asset Transfer or New Loans).  (3) The role of D1-2’s inner circle in arranging and approving the Relevant Loans 197 Members of the Management Board who acted on D1-2’s instructions played key roles at all stages of the arrangement and approval of the Relevant Loans. In particular: (1) 130 of the 134 Relevant Loans “originated” from, were “initiated” by, and had their risk profile assessed by “expert analysis” within Gurieva’s BOK145.  (2) Of the remaining four Relevant Loans, three (to the Cypriot Borrowers) originated from Novikov’s Investment Business, and the remaining loan came from the “credit  143  Aboyan, Khomutov, Svyatchenko, Tymshyn and Zasimenko. 144  D1 RRFI {A2/30.1}, D2 RRFI {A2/33}, D2 RRFI {A2/37}. 145  See Section A3(6)(b) or (c) and (7)(e) or (f) of the Borrower SOFs.  For example: {F1/2/4} (AEF), {F1/3/3} (Agroprom), {F1/4/4} (Alfatrader). \nAA2/1/87\n 82 experts division”.146  (3) Dubilet chaired each ECC meeting at which Relevant Loans were approved; he signed the corresponding minutes for 131 of the 134 Relevant Loans (minutes have not been located for the remaining three).  (4) Dubilet signed the agreements for 115 Relevant Loans. The remaining 19 Relevant Loan agreements were signed by Pikush (15), Morgachov (3), and Yatsenko (1).147 (5) Novikov approved 127 Relevant Loans as a member of the ECC.148   (6) Gurieva approved 129 Relevant Loans as a member of the ECC,149 held a copy of the eponymous spreadsheet on her laptop, and was admittedly “familiar” with the “Scheme” (see ¶121ff above).  (7) In addition to Dubilet, Novikov, and Gurieva, at least 4 other members of the 12-person ECC who approved the Relevant Loans can be demonstrated to be loyal to D1-2, having extensions on ‘the Black’ or other clear personal connections: Chmona (126 Relevant Loans), Yatsenko (129 Relevant Loans), Pikush (129 Relevant Loans) and Gorokhovskiy (129 Relevant Loans).  (8) Other members of the ECC who approved the Relevant Loans did not hold Management Board positions at all: for example, Ponomarev (a member of Gurieva’s team within BOK) approved 125 Relevant Loans. It is inconceivable, given the chain-of-command culture in the Bank, that these members would have gone against the wishes of Dubilet, Novikov, Gurieva et al.  (9) Kazantsev was a custodian of the other eponymous spreadsheet, and was involved in (i) initiating loans on behalf of Borrowers (often at Gurieva’s request) (e.g. {E3/86}, {E7/9}, {E7/11}, {E7/13}, {E7/15}); (ii) backdating relevant documentation (e.g. {E12/111}150); (iii) initiating amendments to Relevant Loans to postpone repayment of capital and interest (e.g. {E7/304} and {E7/311}); and (iv)  146  See {F1/6/3} (Celestrina), {F1/8/2} (Denistron), {F1/15/2} (Fiastra) (originating from the Investment Busines"}

(4) No genuine approval process 198 The Relevant Loans were not subjected to any proper scrutiny by the ECC; rather the so-called approval process was simply a rubber-stamping exercise.  In particular:   (1) Although the ECC minutes gave the appearance of an actual meeting having taken place (referring, for example, to “Attendees”151), the reality was that votes were collected electronically via the Bank’s internal software, with no discussion – or, it would appear, any member of the ECC ever objecting – to the approval of any of the Relevant Loans.   (2) When it was carried out at all,152 the so-called ‘expert analysis’ that was conducted (mostly by employees of BOK) was also transparently a rubber-stamping exercise, that simply ignored the poor financial prospects of the Borrowers. For example: (a) Esmola was granted two Relevant Loans worth UAH 180m and UAH 320m on 12.2.14 and 19.2.14. However, Esmola’s financial statements for the same period – as the expert analysis itself noted – recorded revenue of UAH 10,000, and assets of UAH 19,700 {F1/12/2}. Nevertheless, the expert analysis graded the loan quality in both instances as “II (moderate risk)”, and stated that “[f]uture revenue from commercial activities can serve as sources for repayment”{F1/12/9}{F1/12/13}. (b) Vegatorg was granted a Relevant Loan worth US$54m on 15.10.13, despite recording income of only UAH 28,300 (of which only UAH 2,700 was revenue) over the same period {F1/47/2}. The expert analysis once again suggested that the loan quality was “II (moderate risk)”, and that “[r]evenue from commercial activities and available working capital can serve as sources for repayment” {F1/47/9}. (3) Unsurprisingly, given this creative approach to expert analysis, a significant majority (105 of 134) of the Relevant Loans were graded as only “II (moderate risk)” in the expert analysis (on an ascending scale of “I (low risk)” to “IV (high risk)),153 in spite  151  See e.g. the ECC minutes which approved Relevant Loan 4А13197Д {F2/13/1}. 152  No expert analysis has been found for the Relevant Loans to Celastrina {F1/6/9}, Fiastra {F1/15/7} and Denistron {F1/8/7}, nor for Relevant Loan 4R13347D to Rapit {F1/36/3}.  153  See section A3(6)(e) or (f) of the Borrower SOFs.

(4) Moreover, the financial information put before the ECC was in some instances materially inconsistent on its face, such that the Relevant Loans could not possibly have been properly approved.154 (5) The documents needed for drawdowns (Relevant Loans and RSAs) do not generally appear to have been backdated – loan and supply agreement numbers had to be included in the narrative supplied for the transfer of funds. However, other documents required to be placed on the Bank’s files as support for the loans were in many cases demonstrably prepared later and back-dated so as to appear to have been in existence when the loans were agreed.  For example:  (a) There are examples of ‘technical and economic feasibility studies’ and credit committee presentations being drawn up after the loan agreements had been signed: see e.g. the Uniks study at {F46/7}, produced on 14.8.14, a fortnight after the Relevant Loan was granted. (b) Minutes of the Borrowers’ shareholders approving the Relevant Loans were required by the Bank’s lending manual.155 However, these minutes – where they were produced at all – were drawn up long after the Relevant Loans were approved, between 20.4.15 and 7.7.15. By way of example, Relevant Loan 4R13347D to Rapit was dated 6.6.13, but the minutes of Rapit’s shareholders purportedly approving Rapit’s entry into the loan were signed and backdated nearly two years later on 14.5.15: {E9/202} {E9/206}. For examples, see Schedule 4. (c) There are even instances of loan applications only being drawn up (by the Bank, at the request of Primecap) after the ECC had given its approval for that loan: the ECC minutes approving the Relevant Loans to Densitron and  154  Two expert analyses in respect of the Relevant Loans granted to Agroprom, dated 18.2.14 and 19.2.14, stated that Agroprom had assets of c. UAH 124.9m and “highly liquid assets (cash)” of just UAH 99,100 {F1/3/12} {F1/3/17}. This figure lies in contrast to the financial information set out in the ‘technical and economic feasibility studies’ purportedly prepared by Agroprom dated on 17.2.14 and 18.2.14.  Those feasibility studies record that Agroprom had funds available to it of UAH 555.5m {F1/3/11} {F1/3/16}. Notwithstanding the discrepancy, Agroprom was granted Relevant Loans worth UAH 100m and UAH 390m {F1/3/1}. 155  Section 5.5 of the Lending Procedures Manual {E2/192/10} (11.11.13) and {E2/256/12} (30.8.15): “[t]he legal analysis of documents provided by the potential borrower for compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian regulatory legal acts and internal regulations of the Bank includes: … legitimacy of the minutes of the owner’s decision to take the loan …”. \nAA2/1/90\n 85 Fiastra are dated 25.2.14 {F1/8/7} {F1/15/7}; however, the loan applications were only drawn up a week later.  (6) The great majority of loans were granted within two business days of a loan application having been initiated.156 The speed with which the loan approval process was apparently conducted, despite the Relevant Loans being worth many millions of US$, again gives lie to the notion that the loan applications were properly scrutinised (or, indeed, scrutinised at all).  (5) The role of Primecap and PBC in the Misappropriation 199 If the Relevant Loans had been bona fide lending to independent third parties, the Bank would have negotiated the lending with, and obtained the execution of relevant documents from, those arm’s length borrowers.

(5) The role of Primecap and PBC in the Misappropriation 199 If the Relevant Loans had been bona fide lending to independent third parties, the Bank would have negotiated the lending with, and obtained the execution of relevant documents from, those arm’s length borrowers. What in fact happened was that BOK and PBC (in respect of the Ukrainian Borrowers) and Primecap (in respect of the Cypriot Borrowers) organised the drafting, execution and frequent amendment of all of the Relevant Loans. For example: (1) On 3-4.12.13, Saltiz executed Relevant Loan 4S13774D for US$31m and Relevant Loan 4S13775D for US$28m {F1/40}. The use of Saltiz as a Borrower was initially proposed by Melnyk (PBC), in an email to Gubanova (BOK) dated 29.11.13 {E2/212/2}. On 2.12.13, Gubanova instructed Kazantsev (BOK) that “We are immediately opening a credit line in dollars and hryvnia. We will pay USD59 million … The deadline is December 6” {E2/212}. The “expert analysis” for loan 4С13774D was conducted, ECC approval given, and the loan executed, on that same day: {F1/40/15}, {F1/40}; for Relevant Loan 4С13775D, those same steps took place on 4.12.13: {F1/40/19}, {F1/40}.  (2) On 29.7.14, Uniks executed Relevant Loan 4U14262D for US$37m {F1/46}. The use of Uniks as a Borrower was initially proposed by Travkhina (BOK) in a Skype message to Barsuk (PBC) dated 28.7.14: “… we are now opening a new agreement for Uniks LLC. $37 million, Please send … the financial statements for 2013 and for Q1-Q2 2014. …” {K6/41/10}. Travkhina chased Barsuk the next morning: (at 8:10am) “… Can you tell me what’s going on with EDS157 for Unix? Today is PPB’s158 last day, then on vacation.  156  In the case of 38 Relevant Loans, the purported date of the loan application and date of the approval of the loan by the ECC are both recorded.  In the case of 34 out of 38 of those Relevant Loans, approval was given within two business days of the date of the loan application. See Section A3(3)(a) of the Borrower SOFs (e.g. for Agroprom, {F1/3/2}. 157  A reference to the Bank’s ‘Electronic Document System’, used for signing documents.  158  ‘ППБ’ / ‘PPB’ – Председатель Правления Банка (‘Chair of the Management Board of the Bank’) – is a reference to Dubilet (see e.g.{E9/312/1}). \nAA2/1/91\n 86 Need to sign” and then (at 11.53am) “If we don’t sign today, Unix, there will be more headaches” {K6/41/12}. The loan was executed later that day {F1/46}. (3) As regards the Relevant Loans to the three Cypriot Borrowers, on 26.2.14, Dolmatov (Primecap) sent an email to Morgachev, Kravets and Gluschenko (from the Bank’s Cypriot branch), requesting that they “prepare the documents required for the issuance of” those loans {E3/93}. Dolmatov’s email stipulated not just the values of the loan agreements to be concluded, but also the interest rate, repayment schedule, and deadline by which the documentation had to be prepared.  On 5.3.14, Kravets returned to Dolmatov, for signature by the Cypriot Borrowers, not only three draft loan agreements (backdated to 3.3.14), but also completed loan applications (backdated two weeks to 18-21.2.14).159 Bank employees were thus completing loan applications, on Primecap’s instructions, on behalf of the Borrowers. (6) Worthless or illusory security 200 Despite lending billions of dollars to Borrowers who lacked any economic substance, the Bank did not obtain any genuine or sufficient security: see ¶243ff below.160 Furthermore, with a single exception, the Relevant Loans described the collateral to be provided by the Borrowers as simply a “pledge agreement”,161 without further specification as to the nature or identity of that pledge. No genuine lending (let alone lending running into millions of US$) would ever have been extended on such vague terms.

No genuine lending (let alone lending running into millions of US$) would ever have been extended on such vague terms.  (7) Interest rates 201 The 134 Relevant Loans were entered into between 3.4.13 and 21.8.14 and advanced at interest rates of between 10.3% and 12% per annum.162 Those rates were substantially below the then-prevailing interest rates in Ukraine, as evidenced by the fact that (i) the Bank borrowed UAH 5bn from the NBU on 4.3.14 at the rate of 19.5% {K1/3/86}; and (ii) the IMF’s ‘lending interest rate’ for Ukraine (the bank rate that usually meets the short and medium-term financing needs of the private sector) was 17.718% in 2014.163 It is obviously implausible that the Bank would have genuinely or legitimately granted the Borrowers – entities with no proper credit or trading history – loans at rates so substantially below  159  For Fiastra: {E3/102}, {E3/103}, {E3/104}; for Celastrina: {E3/107}, {E3/108}, {E3/109}; for Densitron:  {E3/112}, {E3/113}, {E3/114}.  160  POC/¶¶19(f), (g.1), 19A(a), 19B {A1/2/12}; Reply/¶¶5, 7 {A1/25/6, 10}.  161  See Section 8(g) of the Borrower SoFs.

For example: {F1/2/5} (AEF: 11%, 10.3%, 11.5%); {F1/4/5} (Alfatrader: 11.6%); {F1/4/5} (Alfatrader: 11.6%).  163  See {H1/10.01}; {A2/16/8}.  \nAA2/1/92\n 87 prevailing rates.   (8) Absence of Supervisory Board approval 202 Approval for the Relevant Loans was given in each case by the ECC, and not by the Supervisory Board.  That was a flagrant breach of a number of the rules and regulations to which the Bank was subject, most obviously that Supervisory Board approval was required (i) for any lending over US$2m {E4/58/9}; and (ii) for any related party lending exceeding US$500,000 {C1/211/15}: see further ¶432 below.164 For example, there is not a hint in the Supervisory Board minutes from meetings held in July/August 2014 of any consideration being given to whether it was appropriate for the Bank to lend UAH 270m and UAH 280m to Dorteks and US$37m to Uniks, despite D1-2 having admitted in these proceedings that they together held 100% interests in these companies. These omissions were no doubt deliberate – by sidestepping the Supervisory Board, D1-2’s fingerprints were kept off the loan approval documents.  (9) Improper and backdated amendments  203 Following their conclusion, each of the Relevant Loans to the Ukrainian Borrowers was subsequently amended; in particular, the date on which interest would be payable was postponed at least once, and sometimes up to 12 times.165 Those amendments only reinforce the conclusion that these were not genuine transactions that were intended to create enforceable obligations, but rather shams executed simply in order to facilitate the Misappropriation.  204 Further still the amendments – and the applications purportedly made by the Borrowers to effect them – were frequently backdated. For example, on 16.12.15, Kazantsev emailed Gozha, asking him to assist in obtaining signed copies of various attached documents relating to the Borrower Ortika {E12/111}, which had themselves been sent to Kazantsev by a BOK employee, Oksana Gudym.  The attachments comprised (i) unsigned addenda to four Ortika Relevant Loans, all dated 13.7.15, i.e. over five months earlier {E12/112} {E12/114} {E12/116} {E12/118}; and (ii) unsigned applications by Ortika seeking those amendments, with the “Filling-in date” said to be 9.7.15 {E12/113} {E12/115} {E12/117} {E12/119}.

The Relevant Loans clearly constituted related party lending, given the breadth of the definition of that term: see Beketov8/¶46ff {C1/1/14}. Even had the Supervisory Board been invited to approve the Relevant Loans, Art. 52 of the Law on Banks prohibited it from approving lending granted on preferential terms: Beketov8/¶46 {C1/1/14}. 165  POC/¶18(c)(i) {A1/2/9}. See Section A3(8) of the SOFs (e.g. for Agroprom {F1/3/4}). \nAA2/1/93\n 88 apparently completed the (backdated) loan amendment application on the Borrower’s behalf. (10) Other points 205 The nine points set out above are all further supported by the equally sham nature of the RSAs, and by the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings brought with the collusion of the Borrowers, D3-8 and the Bank, described below.  (11) Conclusion 206 In summary, the Relevant Loans were obviously improper and sham lending. The purported promises to repay were from worthless companies and the security was illusory; the Relevant Loans were simply a means of extracting money from the Bank. The consequences as a matter of Ukrainian law – as set out in detail in Sections I to K below – are that: (i) D1-2’s conduct in procuring the Relevant Loans to be issued breached the Civil Code, the JSC Law and the Law on Banks; and (ii) the Relevant Loans are void, being transactions contrary to public policy and/or shams. F2 The Relevant Supply Agreements  207 The next key set of documents that formed part of the Misappropriation are the RSAs. A chronology of example RSAs can be found in Schedule 5.  208 Between May and August 2014, 46 of the Borrowers entered into a total of 54 RSAs with D3-8.166 Pursuant to each RSA (i) the Borrower purportedly agreed to make a prepayment in respect of goods (either industrial equipment or commodities) in sums, all denominated in US$, ranging from US$5m to US$59m;167 and (ii) one of D3-8 purportedly agreed thereafter to deliver the goods within a specified period. The overwhelming majority of the RSAs (50 of the 54, with a face value of over US$1.8bn) were concluded with D3-5; the remaining four (with a face value of c. US$101.6m) with D6-8.168 209 The RSAs were not the only Supply Agreements the Borrowers entered into: between October 2013 and August 2014, they concluded at least 129 Supply Agreements (including the RSAs) with 35 different Suppliers (including D3-8), all of which similarly provided for the Borrowers to make prepayments in respect of goods to be delivered at a later date.169  166  The four Borrowers who did not enter into RSAs were Prominmet, Celestrina, Densitron and Fiastra. A list of the 54 RSAs is at POC/Sch. 2 {A1/4/1}. 167  See POC/Sch. 2 {A1/4/1}. 168  {F1/86/1-2} (D5 SOF); {F1/89/1-2} (D3 SOF); {F1/90/1} (D4 SOF); {F1/87/1} (D7 SOF); {F1/88/1} (D6 SOF); {F1/91/1} (D8 SOF). 169  A list of the 129 Supply Agreements relevant to the Bank’s case is at Thompson1/App. 3-3-7 {D1/106P/1}. \nAA2/1/94\n 89 210 None of the Suppliers ever delivered any goods to the Borrowers pursuant to these Supply Agreements. Furthermore:  (1) As discussed in further detail at ¶226ff below, in the case of the 75 non-RSAs, the prepayments made under them were returned to the Borrowers within c. 90 days; those repayments funded the Unreturned Prepayments made under the RSAs.

{"start": 259000, "text": " at Thompson1/App. 3-3-7 {D1/106P/1}. \nAA2/1/94\n 89 210 None of the Suppliers ever delivered any goods to the Borrowers pursuant to these Supply Agreements. Furthermore:  (1) As discussed in further detail at ¶226ff below, in the case of the 75 non-RSAs, the prepayments made under them were returned to the Borrowers within c. 90 days; those repayments funded the Unreturned Prepayments made under the RSAs. A contemporaneous record of this ‘recycling’ was kept within BOK in the form of the Kazantsev Spreadsheet: see ¶240ff below.   (2) The prepayments made under the RSAs were, in contrast, Unreturned Prepayments, i.e. they were never repaid by D3-8 to the Borrowers.170 The final page of the Kazantsev Spreadsheet records the Unreturned Prepayments; the Gurieva Spreadsheet then records that these Unreturned Prepayments were funded by the outstanding debt owed by Borrowers.  211 None of the Supply Agreements was a genuine contract; neither Borrower nor Supplier had any intention that the Supplier would ever deliver the specified goods, nor could they ever have done so given the vast and unrealistic quantities of commodities they purportedly agreed to provide. Rather, each was simply a sham, executed as part of the Misappropriation. As explained in the Defendant Supplier SOFs {F1/86} to {F1/91}, the RSAs possessed the following features:  (1) Commercially inexplicable terms  212 The terms of the RSAs were commercially ridiculous, destroying any suggestion that the contracts were genuine examples of trading activity. Two examples are set out below.  213 First, the quantities of commodities D3-8 agreed to supply are absurd. For example: Defendant Quantity contracted to be sold Problem D4 287,000 tons of PET (by contracts dated June to August 2014); delivery to Dnipro within one year {F1/90/1}. Only 137,000 tons of PET were imported into Ukraine over the whole of 2014 {H1/10.6}. 42,707.5 tons of apple juice concentrate (by contracts dated June to August 2014); delivery to Dnipro by 21.8.15 {F1/90/1}. Ukraine produced c. 70,000-90,000 tons of apple juice concentrate in 2014 and imported just 343 tons {H1/10.3/1}, {H1/10.4/3}. D5 2.431 million tons of Australian manganese ore (by contracts dated May (1) Ukraine only imported 87,417 tons of manganese products from Australia over the whole of 2014 {H1/10.1/2}.  170  Save in respect of four instances where prepayments were repaid in part, i.e. there was a partial Return of Prepayment – see Thompson1/¶¶3.32-3.33 {D1/1/41-42} and 3.160-3.165 {D1/1/93} and App. 3-3-10 {D1/109P/1}. \nAA2/1/95\n 90 to August 2014); delivery to Odessa by December 2014 {F1/86/2}.  (2) Australia’s total manganese ore production for 2014 was 7.7 million tons; the notion that D5 could ever have been expected to deliver 30% of this output in H2/2014 is ludicrous {F1/86/5}, {H1/10.2/2}. \n 214 Plainly, D1-2 (via their lieutenants on their behalf) worked out how much they wished to misappropriate for D1-2, and reverse engineered the quantities of commodities to be inserted into the RSAs, with absurd results. 215 Second, the RSAs: (i) required the Borrowers to prepay the entire contract price (usually tens of millions of US$) in advance of delivery without the use of a conventional trade payment mechanism (e.g. UCP documentary credit, demand guarantee, performance bond or standby credit) or any form of security; and (ii) provided, in spite of this exposure, for lengthy delivery periods of up to a year.171 (2) D3-8’s lack of substance 216 D3-8 were companies who had no commercial substance, still less the wherewithal to supply huge quantities of commodities and other industrial equipment. For example: (1) D3-5 described their business activities to Companies House in generic and indistinct terms: D3 said it provided “Other business activities” {F1/89/5}, D4 “Other service activities not elsewhere classified”  {F1/90/3}, and D5 “Other business support service activities not elsewhere classified” {F1/86/5}.  (2) In their “[a]c"}

(2) In their “[a]ccount fact sheet[s]” D4, D5 and D8 are recorded as having only one employee, with D3, D6 and D7 recorded as having two employees.172 (3) None of D3-8 had any office, website or other public presence: when completing their account fact sheets for the Bank’s Cypriot branch, D3-8 each responded to item 10 (“[w]ebsite of the company (if there is any)”) with either “n/a” or by leaving the field blank.173  (4) D3 – which concluded 14 RSAs with a total value of over US$500m between June and August 2014 {F1/89/1-2} – was registered as dormant in its accounts up to  171  This was the case in relation to 13 of D4’s RSAs: {F1/90/1}.

(5) D4 and D5 both also filed total exemption small company accounts during the period that they entered into RSAs purportedly worth (respectively) c.US$653m  {F1/90/2} and c. US$775m {F1/86/2}: D4’s accounts for year end 31.12.14 recorded assets of US$51,577 {F1/90/3}; D5’s accounts for year end 31.1.15 recorded assets of US$116,981 {F1/86/10}. (6) The Bank has been unable to find (in either Ds’ or its own disclosure) financial statements for D7 or D8 for 2014-16; D6’s financial statements for 2014 show revenue of US$459m purportedly from “sales of products” {E7/171.4/15}. However, the reality of D6-8’s purported business is revealed by their asset disclosure in these proceedings, in which they disclosed hundreds of millions of US$ worth of receivables,175 but went on to state that “the UBO has informed me that the only way in which value of any of the disclosed receivables is capable of being realized is by way of assignment … The way this would work is that a receivable would be used to discharge a corresponding liability which [D6-8] owes to a creditor.  In other words, [D6-8’s] UBO … would agree with a creditor to assign to that creditor a debt owed to [D6-8] in satisfaction of the creditor’s entitlement”.176 This asset position is not consistent with D6-8 engaging in arm’s length trading operations. Instead, it reveals that D6-8 were involved in a series of sham transactions with related companies designed to provide a paper trail for large movements of monies between offshore companies under D1-2’s common control.  In short, it is the epitome of a money-laundering operation. 217 D3-5’s response to these points as to their lack of substance has been to contend that each of them entered into the RSAs as agents for undisclosed principals, viz. the Alleged Principals: D3-8Def/¶¶16-17 {A1/20/5-6}.

There is no evidence of any negotiation between D6-8 and the Borrowers; no credible evidence that D6-8 were active purchasers or sellers of oil in 2014; D6-8 have not tendered a witness to defend the RSAs as genuine commercial agreements (or explain D6-8’s purported business activities); D6-8 immediately paid the funds they received under the RSAs on to third parties (D3-8Def/Annex D (entries 77-83) {A1/24/8}); and their asset disclosure in these proceedings shows that they were neck-deep in D1-2’s money laundering schemes (as to which see ¶216(6) above). (3) Borrowers’ lack of substance 219 The Borrowers’ lack of substance has already been addressed at ¶195ff above. How to respond to this point presents D3-5 with something of a quandary, because their purported beneficial owners (Melnyk, Yesipova, Pugach, Trykulych, Ivlev) were also purported beneficial owners of a number of the Borrowers: for example, when Faboris and D4 entered into RSA PT-23/06 dated 23.6.14 for D4 to supply PET worth $51m to Faboris, Melnyk was purportedly the beneficial owner of both D4 and Faboris {K4-B3/12/1}. 220 Faced with this dilemma, D3-5 initially pleaded that they had no knowledge that the Borrowers had no proper credit or trading history or were owned/controlled by D1-2: D3-8Def/¶14(3) {A1/20/5}. When pressed, however, they said that “knowledge that the Borrower had ‘no proper credit or trading history’…was not held by any individual who was a director or officer of [D3-8] at the time the [RSA] was concluded”: D3-8 RRFI/¶5(a) {A2/40/5}. That careful wording is a transparent attempt to avoid the fact that D3-5’s purported beneficial owners – all PBC employees – knew perfectly well that the Borrowers, of which they were also purported beneficial owners, were shell entities. Indeed, D3-5’s own case is that their purported beneficial owners were “the persons with power to control their respective companies”: D3-8 RRFI/¶1(3) {A2/46/2}. (4) D1-2 owned and/or controlled D3-8 221 As with the Borrowers, D3-8 were owned and/or controlled by D1-2: POC/¶26 {A1/2/19}.  This is addressed in detail in Section G2 below. But in summary:  (1) The purported beneficial owners of D3-8 are all D1-2 nominees.  Indeed, four of the seven acted as nominees for D1-2 pursuant to oral agreements.  Furthermore, \nAA2/1/98\n 93 the directors and shareholders of D3-8 in 2013-2019 were (with one exception) nominees who act for D1-2, and D3-8 were managed by Primecap. (2) D1-2 have long-standing connections with D3-5 (D1 brought proceedings in England relating to the ownership of D3 as long ago as 2003; D5 appears in D2’s asset lists prepared in 2008).

(4) D1-2 have funded D3-8’s legal expenses in these proceedings (including via Sanderlyn and Versala). (5) It is incredible to suppose that they were owned or controlled by anybody else. 222 This conclusion is fortified by the absence of any genuine communications between the Borrowers (as buyers) and D3-8 (as sellers): there are no documents negotiating the terms of the RSAs (including e.g. price or quantity); and there are no communications relating to the performance of these contracts. To the contrary, as explained at ¶263ff below, the only communications seen between the Borrowers and D3-8 are a set of sham exchanges relating to the non-performance of D3-8’s obligations created for the sole purpose of the Ukrainian Proceedings. (5) Role of associates of D1-2  223 BOK, PBC and Primecap administered this part of the Misappropriation as well, including by giving directions for D3-8’s directors (who signed anything sent to them by Primecap for execution) to sign the RSAs. For example, on 4.8.14, Primecap (Dolmatov) sent two batches of RSAs for signature (one set by D3, the other by D5) {E4/213}, including: (i) RSA TI-010814/3 between Intorno and D3 {E4/215}; and (ii) RSA 240714-TU/1 between Uniks and D3 {E4/214}. Executed copies of RSA TI-010814/3  and RSA 240714-TU/1 were returned by Sofocleous the same day {E4/224}{E4/225}{E4/226}. 224 Furthermore, BOK employees tracked the prepayments and returns of prepayments made under the Supply Agreements, in particular via the Kazantsev and Gurieva Spreadsheets.  This demonstrates not only that BOK had full knowledge of the Borrowers’ Prepayments and D3-8’s failure to supply goods, but also that they tracked all of those Prepayments together, as part of a single scheme.   (6) Lack of performance 225 Not only were no goods ever supplied under the RSAs, but there is no evidence that the \nAA2/1/99\n 94 Borrowers ever took any steps preparatory to their delivery (such as, for example, making arrangements for the receipt of the commodities/equipment or their onwards sale to third parties). This is particularly stark in light of the nature of the goods in question: for example, significant logistical arrangements (storage facilities, means of transport etc) would have been required to deliver millions of tonnes of manganese ore from Australia to Ukraine. F3 The Relevant Drawdowns, the recycling and the Unreturned Prepayments  (1) Steps in the Misappropriation  226 The Relevant Loans and Supply Agreements were used in combination to extract money from the Bank and then to move the proceeds into a network of non-Ukrainian companies owned and controlled by D1-2. The first step in the scheme was the use of the sham documents described above to procure Relevant Loans and Relevant Drawdowns.  At its simplest, almost immediately after money had been drawn down by a Borrower under a Relevant Loan, the funds were paid away to a non-Ukrainian company as a purported prepayment under a Supply Agreement.   227 In this way, the Borrowers acted as conduits to extract funds from the Bank and then to launder them through one or more Suppliers.  The Borrowers never held significant cash balances for any period of time, nor did they make any genuine use of the borrowed funds for themselves: they were a means of putting the funds at the disposal of the ‘Suppliers’. 228 The next step in the Misappropriation sc"}

The Borrowers never held significant cash balances for any period of time, nor did they make any genuine use of the borrowed funds for themselves: they were a means of putting the funds at the disposal of the ‘Suppliers’. 228 The next step in the Misappropriation scheme was, typically, the ‘recycling’ of the fraudulently obtained Relevant Drawdowns: this comprised the use of a drawdown to fund a prepayment under a Supply Agreement, which was then returned just under 90 days later, with the returned prepayment then being used to fund a second prepayment under another Supply Agreement. As well as providing a purported basis for transferring fraudulently obtained loan proceeds to further companies owned and controlled by D1-2, the use of Supply Agreements in this way met another need: circumventing Ukrainian currency controls.  During the relevant period, Ukrainian law restricted transactions which involved the export of foreign currency outside Ukraine. However, a resident company (e.g. a Borrower in Ukraine) could pay foreign currency (e.g. US$) to a non-resident (e.g. a Supplier based outside Ukraine) if it was making a prepayment for the supply of goods: Beketov8/¶¶359-360 {C1/1/120}.   229 In this way, the Supply Agreements enabled the funds which had been misappropriated from the Bank to be moved out of Ukraine and in the form of US$. This explains why the Supply Agreements were contemporaneously referred to as “currency contracts” {E6/82P/1}. \nAA2/1/100\n 95 Indeed, D1 has admitted that sham contracts were used in this way by his nominees at the Bank to evade currency restrictions: Yatsenko, in his now withdrawn witness statement (expressly stated to be authorised by D1 and made on D1’s behalf: see ¶1), admitted that the Bank used “mock supply agreements” (¶37), under which no goods were ever intended to be supplied, to evade currency control restrictions. He continued as follows: ¶39: “Until recently, Ukraine had very strict currency control regulations which restricted Ukrainian businesses’ purchase of foreign currency. The whole system was extremely bureaucratic and controlled by the NBU and the State and did not take into account or reflect the reality of international trade. Ukrainian businesses which traded with the outside world needed flexibility in being able to access foreign currency if they wanted to be competitive.” ¶46: “In Ukraine, there is a well-known concept of ‘service’ contracts. Often, to comply with a particular legal or regulatory requirement, a contract needed to include particular essential terms. The parties would enter into a contract which included these essential terms, even though it was understood that these did not reflect the commercial reality of the transaction. The Bank’s customers often used supply agreements as service contracts of this type. To justify the grant of new loans, supply agreements were documented although no supply of goods was expected and in effect the supplier simply borrowed an advance payment from the Bank’s customer until it was repaid.” Yatsenko1/¶¶39, 46 {B2/4/6-7} 230 The “currency control regulations” referred to in this passage are a reference to the Ukrainian law provisions which prescribed a maximum period between the advance payment of US$ to a foreign company and the date of the subsequent delivery of goods to Ukraine or the return of the prepayment. From 2013 to 2016, this period was 90 days: Beketov8/¶¶360-361 {C1/1/120}. Given that (as set out at ¶207ff above) there was no intention ever to perform the Supply Agreements, this meant that each prepayment had to be returned within 90 days in order to avoid a breach of these rules.177 This was critical because, in the event that a prepayment remained outstanding beyond the 90-day"}

From 2013 to 2016, this period was 90 days: Beketov8/¶¶360-361 {C1/1/120}. Given that (as set out at ¶207ff above) there was no intention ever to perform the Supply Agreements, this meant that each prepayment had to be returned within 90 days in order to avoid a breach of these rules.177 This was critical because, in the event that a prepayment remained outstanding beyond the 90-day deadline, the Ukrainian company would be charged interest at 0.3% per day (equivalent to 109% per annum),178 as well as potentially being exposed to additional special penalties, and attracting NBU attention. 231 Accordingly, if the scheme was to continue for more than 90 days, it was necessary, in order to avoid infringing this restriction (and incurring the risk of consequent detection), for the Supplier to return the prepayment to the Borrower, and then for the Borrower to make a new prepayment under a new Supply Agreement (either to the same or a different Supplier).   177  Unless an extension was granted by the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade: Beketov8/¶¶364-365 {C1/1/122}. 178  Beketov8/¶¶366-369 {C1/1/123}. The Bank has identified four sets of Ukrainian proceedings pursuant to which four Borrowers were fined because prepayments they had made had not been returned within 90 days: see (i) claim no. 804/1318/15 in relation to Faboris {I1/82}; (ii) claim no. 804/3352/15 in relation to Rapit {I1/84}; (iii) claim no. 804/6301/15 in relation to Real-Standard {I1/86}; and (iv) claim no. 804/464/15 in relation to Tamersa {I1/88}. \nAA2/1/101\n 96 The new prepayment was almost invariably made on the same day as the return of the previous prepayment.  By cycling prepayments in this way, the 90-day clock could essentially be reset. This process could be repeated every 90 days for as long as the fraudsters desired, thus achieving purported compliance with currency control rules. In practice, as recorded in the Kazantsev Spreadsheet, the practice adopted was to recycle shortly before the 90-day period elapsed in each case. 232 Mr Thompson has provided a diagram (Figure 3-2 in Thompson1 {D1/1/35}, also set out in Section A, at ¶2(3) above) illustrating these steps in the scheme. In summary, and by reference to the steps shown in that diagram, the fraud operated in the following manner:179 (1) Once a Relevant Loan had been obtained, the Borrower made a Relevant Drawdown (either in UAH or US$) [Step 1]. (2) If the Relevant Drawdown had been made in UAH, it was converted by the Bank at the request of the Borrower to US$ within a matter of hours expressly for the purposes of making a prepayment under an identified Supply Agreement (the purported intention to use the funds to purchase goods meant that the conversion satisfied currency control requirements) [Step 1a].  (3) The funds held by the Borrower (always in US$ by this stage) were then paid to Supplier #1 by way of a prepayment under Supply Agreement #1 [Step 2]. (4) Just less than 90 days later, the prepayment was returned by Supplier #1 to the Borrower under Supply Agreement #1 [Step 4], such return of prepayment being necessary to avoid breaching rules regarding the maximum period (of 90 days) between the advance payment and the date of the subsequent delivery.  (5) Upon the prepayment being returned (in US$), currency control regulations required the Borrower to convert 50% and later 100% {C1/1/126} of such funds from US$ to UAH; the Borrower would then tend to convert at least some of those UAH back into US$ in order to make the next prepayment (and would make additional drawdowns to cover losses arising from: (i) the payment of a compulsory national pension insurance fee payable when purchasing foreign currency; and (ii) the application of different FX rates – such additional drawdowns being known as “FX  179  Whilst this diagram is a helpful illustration, it should be emphasis"}

In particular, the number of cycles may have been fewer (e.g. in some cases, only Steps 1 and 2 took place, such that Step 2 was the Unreturned Prepayment) or there may have been no repayments or further drawdowns (e.g. no equivalents of Steps 3, 5 and 8). \nAA2/1/102\n 97 Top-ups”) [Steps 4a and 7a]. The conversion of UAH back to US$ was recorded as being for the purpose of making a further prepayment under a new supply agreement (Supply Agreement #2).  (6) A new prepayment would then be made to either the same Supplier (Supplier #1) or a new Supplier (Supplier #2) under Supply Agreement #2 [Step 6].  On some occasions, the new prepayment under Supply Agreement #2 would be funded entirely from the return of prepayment under Supply Agreement #1; on others, part of the return of prepayment under Supply Agreement #1 would be used to repay capital and/or service interest on a loan [Step 5], with a further Relevant Drawdown being made to provide the additional funds required to make the next prepayment [Step 3]. (7) If necessary, that cycle could be repeated, with the prepayment under Supply Agreement #2 returned after a further 90 days and then a further prepayment made under Supply Agreement #3 [Step 7].  And so forth.  (2) The end of the recycling   233 The above paragraphs describe what generally180 took place for so long as the scheme remained in the active phase of its operation – monies were taken from the Bank through drawdowns under loans which were fraudulently obtained using sham documents, and the funds were recycled so as to avoid a breach of currency restrictions and detection.  234 However, for each of the Relevant Loans which are the subject of these proceedings, there came a point – between August and November 2014 – when the Supplier to which the extracted monies had been recycled (viz. D3-8) failed to return the prepayment it had received. The prepayments thus became the Unreturned Prepayments. 235 The end of the scheme appears to have been brought about by increasing scrutiny from the NBU. In particular: (i) on 29.8.14, the NBU passed Resolution 540, which set out how the NBU would start to examine documents submitted by banks seeking to convert UAH to US$ to prevent “unfair practices of foreign exchange transactions, in particular the purchase of foreign currency under fictitious agreements” {E4/366/4}; (ii) on 1.9.14, the NBU wrote to the Bank setting out how requests to purchase foreign currency would need to be submitted to the NBU in a register, together with supporting documents {E4/367}; (iii) on 4.9.14, the NBU  180  There are certain cases which are much simpler (where the Relevant Drawdown directly funded the Unreturned Prepayment without any intermediate 90-day loops) and some which more complex (e.g. the Alfatrader-Collyer Unreturned Prepayment funded by the Relevant Drawdowns by the Cypriot Borrowers). For six examples – from simple to complex – see Thompson1/¶¶3.37-3.170 {D1/1/43}. \nAA2/1/103\n 98 rejected the Bank’s attempts to purchase US$ for Raneya, Karinda, Milorin and Alfatrader (each a Borrower).

At this point, the only way for the Borrowers to avoid substantial penalties under currency laws was for them (i.e. the purported purchasers) to bring claims and obtain judgments against the ‘defaulting’ Supplier: Beketov8/¶¶370-371 {C1/1/124}. The need to avoid such penalties was undoubtedly one of the drivers for the collusive 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings: see ¶263ff below. 238 Mr Thompson has analysed the Bank’s transactional data to identify all Relevant Drawdowns and Unreturned Prepayments, and to confirm that the Unreturned Prepayments were (as alleged by the Bank) in fact funded by the Relevant Drawdowns. He has confirmed the accuracy and completeness of the Bank’s case: Thompson1/¶¶3.15-3.17 {D1/1/36-37}.  In short: (1) The 50 Borrowers made 270 Relevant Drawdowns under the 134 Relevant Loans totalling US$2.34bn (Thompson1/¶¶3.21-3.22 {D1/1/38}); (2) 82 Unreturned Prepayments were made under 54 RSAs (95% by value of which were paid to D3-5). The net Unreturned Prepayments, after deducting partial returns of prepayment, total US$1,911,877,385 (Thompson1/¶¶3.160-3.168 {D1/1/93-95}); and (3) The Unreturned Prepayments were funded by the Relevant Drawdowns (Thompson1/¶¶3.17-3.22 {D1/1/37-38} and 3.164 {D1/1/95}). \nAA2/1/104\n 99 (3) The Kazantsev and Gurieva Spreadsheets  239 The above is not only the product of the expert analysis by Mr Thompson of the Bank’s transactional data, but it also reflects what two key D1-2 lieutenants within BOK, who were tasked with implementing the scheme, recorded in contemporaneous documents. In this regard, there are two key documents: the Kazantsev and Gurieva Spreadsheets. 240 The Kazantsev Spreadsheet {E7/39P} consists of a series of c. twice weekly worksheets, produced between 30.12.13 and 1.9.14, which were used by BOK to keep track of the prepayments, returns of prepayments, and the Unreturned Prepayments.  On its final worksheet (dated 1.9.14), the Kazantsev Spreadsheet shows outstanding unreturned prepayments of US$1,911,877,385. Mr Thompson has confirmed that the Kazantsev Spreadsheet is, save for a small number of immaterial errors, consistent with the Bank’s transactional data: Thompson1/¶¶3.200-3.202 {D1/1/107-108}. 241 The Kazantsev Spreadsheet is a significant contemporaneous document which strongly supports the Bank’s case, because it (i) identifies the amount of the prepayments which had not been returned (i.e. remained “repayable”) in the same amount as the Unreturned Prepayments (i.e. US$1,911,877,385); (ii) identifies the same Unreturned Prepayments as the Bank has identified as being involved in the Misappropriation; (iii) demonstrates that BOK employees linked prepayments to returns of prepayment by reference to Supply Agreement numbers; (iv) lists the same companies (i.e. Borrowers and D3-8) as the Bank has identified as bein"}

A further copy of this document was held by Novikov.182 As with the Kazantsev Spreadsheets, the data in the Gurieva Spreadsheet relating to the Borrowers’ loans and the Unreturned Prepayments is almost entirely consistent with the Bank’s transactional data: Thompson1/¶¶3.206-3.220 {D1/1/109}. In terms of substance, the Gurieva Spreadsheet is an important document for the Bank’s case because: (i) it identifies  181  Save only that, in respect of the Cypriot Borrowers and Prominmet, the Kazantsev Spreadsheet identifies the immediate source of the prepayment (i.e. Paradiz and Foxar) rather than the Relevant Borrower which received the funds from the Bank and, via other companies, provided it to the company making the prepayment.  182  {E18/235.4M}, bearing the original filename “КП трейдеров и предоплата c корп правами.xls” (i.e. “CP of traders and prepayment with corporate rights”) used in 2014 (see {K6/53.6.1/1}).  \nAA2/1/105\n 100 the total amount of the outstanding prepayments as US$1,911,877,385, consistent with the Bank’s case on Unreturned Prepayments; (ii) it identifies the total amount outstanding under the Borrowers’ loans as at 19.11.14 as UAH 28bn (equivalent to US$1.8bn), made up of UAH 11.7bn and US$1.21bn;183 (iii) it links the Borrowers’ outstanding loan balances to the Unreturned Prepayments made by the Borrowers to D3-8; (iv) it links the Unreturned Prepayments to previous returns of prepayment in the same way as does the Bank in its analysis of the scheme. This demonstrates that BOK – including the head of that department, Gurieva – contemporaneously used the same analysis as that on which the Bank relies as part of its factual case in these proceedings. Little wonder, then, that D1 has declined to tender Gurieva as a witness for trial. F4 Purported security for the Relevant Loans 243 The Relevant Loans were purportedly secured in three ways, namely by (i) pledges over the RSAs; (ii) pledges over a further class of Supply Agreement, the “Loan File Supply Agreements” or “LFSAs”; and (iii) ‘Share Pledges’ granted over certain D1-2 companies. None of these forms of security was genuine or provided the remotest protection for the Bank against the Borrowers’ inevitable default. They were put in place to mislead, were never called upon, and (in the case of the Share Pledges) were released prior to the Bank’s nationalisation.  Indeed, the contemporaneous emails indicate that PBC routinely produced contracts for the purpose of creating sham security upon BOK’s request: see, for example, {E5/199}, {E9/241}, {E10/289.1}, {E12/52.1}. (1) Pledges over the RSAs 244 The bottom-right corner of the Gurieva Spreadsheet says “The NBU took charge over contractual receivables under contracts with non-resident companies as loan security” {E18/213P}. In the case of the Relevant Loans, the purported security consisted of pledges over the contractual rights purportedly created by the RSAs.  Given that the RSAs were worthless shams (see ¶207ff above), this security was obviously worthless to"}

In the case of the Relevant Loans, the purported security consisted of pledges over the contractual rights purportedly created by the RSAs.  Given that the RSAs were worthless shams (see ¶207ff above), this security was obviously worthless too.  In addition to the RSA Pledges, the Bank (via BOK) also entered, at around the same time, into agreements with Borrowers entitling the Bank to take over the Borrowers’ rights as against D3-8 under the RSAs: see, for example, {E3/274.1}, {E4/46.01}, {E4/75.01}, {E4/205.1}, {E4/242.1}. In theory, that would have entitled the Bank to take over and enforce the 2014 Ukrainian Judgment debts of US$1.9bn against D3-8. But in reality these assignment agreements were worthless, and  183  It also explains that the Borrowers owed the Bank a further c. UAH 4.9bn in ‘indexed commission fees’ which tied the value of UAH loans to their US$ value on the date of drawdown. The total owed by the Borrowers including principal, interest and fees is recorded as UAH 33bn (US$2.1bn). See Section O below.  \nAA2/1/106\n 101 they were subsequently terminated in 2015 {E7/264.1}, {E7/264.2}, {E7/264.3}, {E7/267.5}, {E7/269.1.1}. (2) Purported security for the Relevant Loans: the LFSAs and LFSA Pledges  245 In addition to pledges over the RSAs, the Relevant Loans were purportedly secured by pledges (the “LFSA Pledges”) over a further set of sham agreements, the LFSAs (identified in POC/Sch1 {A1/3}). These LFSAs were materially similar to the RSAs, save for one fundamental difference: this second set of supply agreements provided for payment upon supply of the goods, rather than prepayment in advance.   246 The LFSAs were yet further shams. They were not, and were never intended to be, performed in any respect whatsoever.  Rather, the purpose of the LFSAs was simply to sit on the Bank’s files, to make it appear as though the Bank’s lending was adequately secured; consistently with this role, no payments were ever made from Borrower to Supplier under them. 247 As set out in POC/Sch1 {A1/3}, at least 78 further sham LFSAs were purportedly entered into between 5.9.13 and 22.10.15 by 44 of the Borrowers to secure Relevant Loans; in 37 instances, those LFSAs were concluded with one of D3-5.  Those LFSAs exhibited the same absurdities as the RSAs, such as improbable volumes of commodities or goods. For the reasons set out at ¶211ff above in relation to the RSAs, there was simply no prospect of D3-5 ever being able to deliver the goods and commodities they undertook to supply under the LFSAs (which, implausibly, allowed for delivery 14 to 30 months in the future), and none were in fact provided.  248 The reason for the generation of so many LFSAs and LFSA Pledges becomes apparent when one considers the point in time when a great number of these documents were produced: at least 31 of the LFSAs and LFSA Pledges were executed in late 2014 or early 2015. At this point in time, the active phase of the Misappropriation had come to a halt, and the programme of commencing the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings, leading to findings by Ukrainian courts/arbitral tribunals that D3-8 had defaulted on their obligations and failed to deliver any goods under the RSAs, was well underway (as to which see further ¶263ff below).  249 These events had side-effects for the Relevant Loans’ security. For as long as the Borrowers made prepayments under Supply Agreements, and had (at least on the face of the documents) the right to receive goods from the Suppliers in return, the Bank had (ostensibly) good security over the Relevant Loans in the form of the RSA Pledges. However, from late \nAA2/1/107\n 102 2014 onwards, those purported rights disappeared: the Borrowers’ rights under the RSAs were replaced "}

For as long as the Borrowers made prepayments under Supply Agreements, and had (at least on the face of the documents) the right to receive goods from the Suppliers in return, the Bank had (ostensibly) good security over the Relevant Loans in the form of the RSA Pledges. However, from late \nAA2/1/107\n 102 2014 onwards, those purported rights disappeared: the Borrowers’ rights under the RSAs were replaced with judgments requiring the Suppliers to return the prepayments they had received under the RSAs (see e.g. {F122/22/8}). Since the Borrowers no longer had any right to receive goods under the RSAs, the RSAs and RSA Pledges were thus (even on their face) worthless security, as the Borrowers no longer had any contractual rights to pledge. In order to plug this gap, new sham documentation had to be hastily produced, to give the appearance that the Bank’s lending had been adequately secured all along. The absurdity of generating further apparent collateral in reliance upon the contractual promises of (by that time) judgment debtors does not appear to have troubled the LFSAs’ creators.  (3) The Share Pledges 250 The ‘Share Pledges’ have been introduced above. By way of further explanation: (1) D1-2 say that the Relevant Loans were “fully secured” {A1/8/13} (¶17-18), relying on 50 Share Pledges. The Share Pledges were granted by 40 pledgors (of which 38 were corporate entities) over shares in 25 companies. The Bank has prepared 50 Share Pledge SOFs, found at {F1/92/1} to {F1/119.22/1}.184  (2) D1-2 have pleaded that they made available their assets to the Bank “for its use as collateral for loans as necessary” and “to improve the Bank’s capital and/or financial position”: D1Def/¶20(3)(d) {A1/8/15}; D2Def/¶30(4) {A1/18/14}. They have never troubled to explain why, if they did indeed wish to “improve the Bank’s capital”, they did not simply contribute equity to the Bank and allow the loans to be impaired. Instead, D1 contends that he “was not responsible for determining precisely how [his assets] were to be used”; and D2 pleads that “he was not aware that the security took the form of share pledges”, that “he was not aware that the assets of entities in which he had an interest had secured the lending secured by the Share Pledges”, and that he did not pledge his assets “because he had (or was aware of having) any interest in the borrowers whose loans were thus secured”.185  (3) It is incredible that (i) D1-2 did not know all about the Share Pledges and (ii) D1-2 would be willing to pledge – on their case, valuable – assets to secure lending to third-party borrowers with which they had no connection. The truth is that D1-2 knew that the Share Pledges were used as purported security for lending to their  184  Two of the Share Pledges do not purport on their face to have secured any Relevant or Intermediary Loans: Share Pledge CY00XC/9z in respect of shares in PJSC Triika Invest {F1/119.4}; and Share Pledge CY001W/8z in respect of Shares in PJSC AVK Finance {F1/119.5}. 185  D1Def/¶20(3)(d) {A1/8/15}; D2 RRFI (Response to Request 2(a)) {A2/39.2/2}; D2Def/¶30(4) {A1/18/14}. \nAA2/1/108\n 103 own companies, but knew that it posed little risk to their asset empire, because the Share Pledges did not provide any genuine security, as D1-2’s bank would never enforce them. Indeed, consistent with this conclusion, the Bank did not enforce the Share Pledges or even threaten to do so. In late 2016, shortly prior to nationalisation, D1-2 procured the release of the Share Pledges. (4) Even if the Share Pledges had been enforced, the Bank would have been disappointed. As the experts agree, the companies whose shares were pledged were worth only a fraction of the value stated in the Share Pledges: the Bank’s expert says that the overstatement was 89-96% {D10/11/3}, whilst D1’s expert puts the overstatement at c. 71-95% {D12/1/55}.

The Court probably does not need to rule on which expert is correct: on any view, and even if they had been valid agreements, the Share Pledges provided woefully inadequate security for the Relevant Loans.  251 Three key Share Pledge points are addressed below. (a) D1-2 owned and controlled the Share Pledge companies 252 D1 has admitted that, between April 2013 and September 2014, he and D2 owned and/or controlled, in whole or in part: (i) 22 (57%) of the 38 pledgor companies; and (ii) 20 (80%) of the 25 companies whose shares were pledged: D1Def/Sch. 6 {A1/17}. D2 has, once again, been content to adopt D1’s position.186  253 It is inherently improbable that the remaining companies were not owned and controlled by D1-2. Why would third parties voluntarily charge their allegedly valuable assets to secure lending of unconnected borrowers? Indeed, there is overwhelming evidence that D1-2 did own and control the remaining companies. For example: (1) One of the pledgors, Celastrina, is a Borrower. Although D1 denies ownership and control of Celastrina in these proceedings, he admitted that he owned and controlled it in the Pinchuk Proceedings: see {E5/157.2/21} and ¶312(2) below. (2) Eleven of the pledgors, all offshore companies, purportedly granted pledges over shares in PJSC Erlan. D1-2 deny ownership and control of all 12 companies {A1/17/2}. But see, for instance: (i) D2’s 2010 CV, which boasts that he held “a significant interest in Erlan”, whose “flagship product is the Biola brand” {E1/85/8}; (ii) a WhatsApp sent by Gurieva to D1 on 29.7.15, asking for D1’s consent for Biola to make the following payments “operations – 480 thousand, raw materials – 3.2 million”  186  Enyo (22.6.22, 2nd) {L/76.1}, Hogan Lovells (6.7.22) {L/82} and Enyo (2.8.22, 2nd) {L/85}. \nAA2/1/109\n 104 {K5-A1/27/2}; (iii) Biola LLC’s inclusion in the Bank’s related party lists in early 2016 {E14/197/12} {E17/142.2/22}; and (iv) a news article sent by D2 to D1 on 27.6.19, which states that D1 had “… won disputes in the Supreme Court over the claims of … Erlan against the NBU and PrivatBank  ….” {K5-A2/5/30} {K5-C1/154/2}. (3) The Share Pledge companies were managed by Primecap (and are often mentioned in D1-2’s asset disclosure); and the purported beneficial owners of these companies include familiar D1-2 nominees: Reply/Annexes D {A1/29} and E {A1/30}. (b) The Share Pledges were worth only a fraction of their stated value 254 Each of the Share Pledges ascribes a value to the shares allegedly pledged thereunder. For example, Sch. 1 to the version of the Feral Pledge in force as at 27.6.14 states that the 49% of shares in SC Feral SRL had a value of UAH 3,089,270,877 {F1/107/4}. D1’s own expert disagrees: Mr Taylor considers the value of the Feral shares to have been UAH 170-263m or 6%-9% of the stated value.187 Mr Bezant, for the Bank, considers that they were worth UAH 163m (or 5% of the stated value).188  255 In fact, the level of agreement between the parties’ respective experts on this issue is remarkable. Despite D1’s expert’s complaints about a lack of information, the experts agree that, in respect of the Share Pledges which they have both valued as at 31.12.13, 31.12.14 and 31.12.15, the shares that were pledged were worth a fraction of the value ascribed to them on the face of the Share Pledges (Bank: max. 11%; D1: max. 29%):189 Date Value recorded in Share Pledges190 Bank: Mr Bezant (% of value recorded in Share Pledges)191 D1: Mr Taylor (% of value recorded in Share Pledges)192 31.12.13"}

Table 5-7 records the aggregate value of the Share Pledges as at 31.12.2015 at UAH 7,381 – 17,442m. This appears to be a miscalculation caused by Mr Taylor presenting his lower-end and higher-end valuations for Share Pledges DZK-1534 (GM) and DZK-1529 (Erlan) the wrong way around. The figures in this table account for the correction of that error.  193  The figure of UAH 109,988m from the Second Joint Statement {D10/11/2} was updated to UAH 110,008m in Mr Taylor’s and Mr Bezant’s Supplemental Report, due to the identification of a signed version of Share Pledge DZK-3921 which showed it was in force as at 31 December 2015 (Bezant-SharePledges3/Table 3-6 {D11/1/28} and Taylor3/Table 5-8 {D12/1/56}).  \nAA2/1/110\n 105 256 Even more remarkably, in 22 instances, Mr Taylor states the companies whose shares were pledged may have been worth nothing as at the valuation date. See Schedule 8.  257 The reasons which led the experts to conclude that the values of the pledged companies had been vastly inflated include: (1) Flawed underlying valuations. The experts agree that the valuation analysis relied on by the Bank at the time “is generally unreliable or unsupported” because (i) the forecast future performance of the pledged company is inconsistent with its historical performance; (ii) the valuation does not account for the debt of the pledged company; (iii) the valuations are of the wrong asset or company, or (iv) the valuations are affected by other defects: PledgesJR1, ¶4.2 {D10/1/16}. (2) The valuation analyses relied upon within the Bank were often absurd. For example: (a) Ukrnafta was Ukraine’s largest non-financial listed company as of 31.12.15, with a market capitalisation of UAH 9.5bn. In comparison, the pledge over Derling’s shares valued it at UAH 18bn on this date, with six other Share Pledge companies being valued in the Share Pledges at more than UAH 9.5bn on one of the valuation dates: {D8/1/47} (¶¶3.26-3.27). (b) The valuations of the Share Pledge companies relied upon their businesses suddenly skyrocketing, albeit without investment or explanation as to how this dramatic improvement might be realised. In the event, seven of the companies (or their immediate parents) entered into insolvency processes within four years of the final Share Pledge: {D8/1/14} (¶2.12).  (c) The values attributed to the Share Pledge companies are inconsistent with D1-2’s own (January 2018) Asset Disclosure. The UAH 18bn attributed to Derling’s value in the Share Pledges is to be contrasted with D1-2’s valuation of UAH 144-423m (Mr Bezant says it was worth nothing). Feral was said to be worth UAH 15.7bn in the Share Pledges, D2’s Tatneft asset disclosure given in September 2016 valued Feral at UAH 357m {I3/39/16}, whilst D1-2’s January 2018 value was UAH 363m (broadly consistent "}

There are numerous other examples: see {D8/1/80}. (3) Inconsistencies. The experts have also identified multiple versions of the same Share Pledge with the same date that imply different overall valuations for the company: PledgesJR1/¶4.4 {D10/1/17}. They also note that the valuations of companies \nAA2/1/111\n 106 differ materially in a short period of time: ibid. By way of example, shares in Clendon Holdings were pledged under Share Pledge DZK-1585. Mr Bezant notes that two amendments to that pledge, dated 30.3.16 and 31.3.16, imply 100% pro rata values for Clendon of UAH 76.7bn and UAH 90.9bn respectively (i.e. an increase of UAH 14.2bn or c. 20% in a single day) {D8/1/61} {F149/13/11} {F149/14/11}.194 258 D1 clings onto his case that the Share Pledges provided full security by making two points: (1) First, that PwC, when they audited the Bank, failed to spot that the Share Pledges were vastly overstated {A1/8/13} (¶18(2)). But (i) auditors have failed to identify some of the largest frauds of the past decades (e.g. Enron, Wirecard, Worldcom, Carillion and Patisserie Valerie); (ii) PwC failed to spot any other part of the Misappropriation and to qualify the Bank’s accounts accordingly; (iii) the Bank’s replacement auditors, EY, provided heavy qualifications to the Bank’s accounts and wrote down its corporate loan book substantially (e.g. {D19/1/32}; and (iv) the Bank has sued PwC for negligence {PTR-B1/19/9} (¶39).  (2) Second, that if the Bank had been able to obtain PwC’s papers from it (which PwC has refused to divulge),195 the Share Pledge valuations would be seen to be entirely justified. This is the stuff of fantasy: see the points made above. Indeed, if D1-2 had wanted to obtain more documents to justify the Share Pledge valuations, they could have obtained them from their own Share Pledge companies, as D1’s solicitors rightly accepted on 12.3.21 {PTR-B1/22/5}. (c) The Share Pledges were not enforced and were released pre-nationalisation 259 The Bank never took any steps to enforce the Share Pledges, or even threatened to do so. Instead, the dates on which the Relevant Loans were repayable were routinely extended so that the Bank could claim that there had been no default.   260 Then, by mid-November 2016, all of the Share Pledges were released.196 D1’s case is that the Bank was nationalised before any replacement security could be put in place:  194  Two further examples: (1) the value of 49% of the shares in Memento d.o.o. pledged under Share Pledge DZK-1525 was said to be UAH 485m on 31.1.14 {F141/1/10}, UAH 738m on 29.9.14 {F141/4/2} and UAH 2.286bn on 31.3.15 {F141/7/3}. (2) The value of 49% of the shares in Retal Dnipro pledged under Share Pledge DZK-1584 was said to be UAH 2.03bn on 27.6.14 {F148/1/20}, UAH 4.75bn on 31.3.15 {F148/5/12} and UAH 6.76bn on 31.12.15 {F148/10/10}.  195  The Bank’s letters to PwC seeking disclosure of papers provided to it during the course of its work for the Bank have been provided to D1: see {L/70} {L/71} {L/74} {L/77} {L/79} {L/84} {L/90} {L/93}  {L/94} {L/95} {L/106} {L/107} {L/120} {L/121} {L/145} {L/147} {L/148} {L/151} {L/152} {L/153}.

He suggests that it was the NBU which caused the New Borrowers to pay the lending of the 193 Borrowers, and that “[i]n consequence, the security for the loans repaid was discharged”: ibid.  261 This is false: the Share Pledges were terminated by termination agreements, not as a “consequence” of the repayment of the purportedly secured loans. Any suggestion that the NBU procured the termination of the Share Pledges is categorically rejected by Shekmar.197 It also makes no sense: why would the NBU, which was seeking to recapitalise the Bank, have required it to release ostensibly valuable security without replacing it?198 262 The Bank prepared draft replacement share pledges, to be granted over the same shares, as security for the New Loans;199 however, they were never executed. Given the speed with which the Bank and Primecap were able to procure the execution of documents by the supine Cypriot directors who staffed D1-2’s companies (including the pledgors), this was clearly a deliberate decision. F5 The 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings  263 As described at ¶31 above, in late 2014, 46 of the Ukrainian Borrowers brought 51 claims before the Economic Court of Dnepropetrovsk and three sets of arbitration proceedings against one of D3-8 in respect of the latter’s failure to supply goods under the RSAs. Each of the Borrowers subsequently obtained judgments requiring D3-8 to return the prepayments they had received.  None of those judgments has ever been enforced. That is unsurprising: none of these claims was genuinely brought by the Borrower concerned in order to obtain repayment.  Rather, the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings were procured and pursued by BOK, PBC and Primecap using (i) sham correspondence between the Borrowers and D3-8 manufactured (and frequently backdated) specifically for the purpose; and (ii) funds procured from the Bank itself in order to finance the costs of the proceedings.  The key points to note are as follows: 264 First, as the 2014 Ukrainian Judgments frequently record {F122/22/3} {F122/25/5}, prior to the claims being commenced, (i) one of D3-8 sent the Borrower a letter stating that it was  197  Shekmar’s evidence is that “…we had no advance warning, let alone control, over when the loans to the 193 Borrowers were repaid, and therefore when the prior security was released. I never gave any instructions to the Bank to the effect that the loans to the 193 Borrowers should be repaid, or that the security should be released, and nor was I (or am I) aware of anyone else from my team (or, indeed, the NBU more generally) having done so”: Shekmar/¶61 {B1/12/19}.  198  The release of the Share Pledges was another task that fell to Primecap. Indeed, it was a task that required some backdating: see, e.g., {F143/10}, {E16/111.01} {E16/111.01} (email) and {E16/111.02} (attached signed agreement).  199  See, e.g., {E16/36.1} {E16/36.2} {E16/36.3} {E16/36.4}.  \nAA2/1/113\n 108 unable to perform its obligations under the RSA; (ii) the Borrower responded stating that it was terminating the RSA, and seeking repayment; and (iii) the Borrower and one of D3-8 concluded an addendum to the RSA, requiring the latter to refund the Borrower by a specified date (which it failed to do). 265 None of this documentation was genuine. Rather, it was executed on the instructions of Primecap, frequently as a ‘package’ a matter of days before the claim was commenced, presumably in order to give the appearance to the Ukrainian court/tribunal that the contracts, and the claims pursued thereunder, were legitimate.

Indeed, the documents were executed by following a well-trodden path: they were provided in draft by PBC to Primecap; then by Primecap to the Cypriot CSPs; then executed by the Cypriot CSPs and returned to Primecap; and then relied on by the Borrowers in their statements of claim (often filed only a few days later).

PLEASE HELP TO FINALIZE SIGNING WITHIN TODAY”: {E6/27.3} {E6/27.4}. 8.10.14  08:07am Tsitsekkos returns the executed amendment agreement to Primecap: {E6/29.1} {E6/29.2}. 8.10.14 Rudnex claim issued in the Dnipropetrovsk Commercial Court (accepted the following day) {F122/31/32-33}.  266 Second, in early October 2014, the RSAs were amended to make clear that jurisdiction was conferred upon the courts of Ukraine. Those amendments were again undertaken at the orchestration of PBC and Primecap: for example, on 2.10.14 Tsitsekkos returned to Primecap nine amendment agreements revising the wording of the dispute resolution clause {E5/310/1}. The different wording is side-by-side below (using D3-Karinda RSA TK-030614/1 as an example):  \nAA2/1/114\n 109 Original wording {F122/21/10}  Amended wording {E5/311/2} 10.2 All disputes, controversies or claims arising hereunder or in connection with it, including interpretation, performance, breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be settled in accordance with the legislation of Ukraine. 10.2. All disputes, controversies or claims arising  hereunder or in connection with it, including its  interpretation, performance, breach, termination or  invalidity thereof, shall be settled on the territory of  Ukraine and in accordance with the legislation of Ukraine.   267 Third, all of the claims proceeded in the absence of D3-8, which each asked the Ukrainian court to consider the case in their absence. Their (lack of) participation was once again instigated by Primecap, doubtless to expedite the procurement of a judgment in favour of the relevant Borrower.  Thus, in relation to the claim brought by Foxar against D5: Date Event 26.9.14 Foxar commences Ukrainian Case No. 904/7380/14 against D5 to recover the prepayment made under RSA CF-1906/3 and to terminate the RSA Pledge granted by Foxar in favour of the Bank  {E5/275.1}. 6.10.14 Email from Primecap (Dolmatov) to Sofocleous requesting “execution [by D5] of the "}

Thus, in relation to the claim brought by Foxar against D5: Date Event 26.9.14 Foxar commences Ukrainian Case No. 904/7380/14 against D5 to recover the prepayment made under RSA CF-1906/3 and to terminate the RSA Pledge granted by Foxar in favour of the Bank  {E5/275.1}. 6.10.14 Email from Primecap (Dolmatov) to Sofocleous requesting “execution [by D5] of the attached document in 2 exemplars. Please email the scanned copy and couriers the originals after the full execution” {E5/385/1}. Attached to the email was a draft letter from D5 to the Ukrainian Court in relation to Foxar’s claim {E5/386/1}. It said: “To date, our company has not returned the previously received advance payment in connection with which COLLYER LIMITED has a debt to LLC ‘FOXAR’ under the contract No.CF-1906/3 from 19.06.2014 in the amount of 35,300,000.00 dollars. USA. In addition, due to the impossibility of the representative of our company to be present at the meeting, we ask the court to consider this case without our participation.” 6.10.14 Email from Sofocleous to Primecap attaching a signed copy of the letter from D5 to the Ukrainian Court: {E5/393/1} {E5/394}. 23.10.14 The Ukrainian Court hands down judgment in case number 904/7380/14 and orders D5 to repay the prepayment made by Foxar under RSA 1906/3, but refuses to terminate the RSA Pledge {F124/42}. \n 268 Fourth, the Bank itself – at the instigation of Melnyk and employees of BOK – provided the funds for Borrowers to pursue the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings, notwithstanding that the Bank was a defendant to the proceedings and that the part of the relief sought was to invalidate the Bank’s purported security. Thus, between 24.9.14 and 2.10.14, Kazantsev (BOK) sent Skype messages to other BOK employees directing that loans should be issued to pay the Borrowers’ court fees for the proceedings. For example:  \nAA2/1/115\n 110 Kazantsev (BOK) 24.9.14 at 07:28:27 “today’s loans: Transmoloko LLC 77 298 Prado 77 298 for court fee.” Kazantsev (BOK) 25.9.14 at 08:46:29 “today’s loans: Elsis Time 77 296 Milorin 77 298 for court fee” Skype chat between BOK employees on 24-25.9.14 {K6/48/1-2} 269 Notably (i) Transmoloko instituted its claim against D4 on or about 26.9.14 (two days after Kazantsev’s message) {F123/56/21} and (ii) Transmoloko was awarded costs in its claim against D4 of UAH 77,080 – almost identical to the UAH 77,298 specified by Kazantsev {F123/56/23}. 270 On 10.10.14, Melnyk (PBC) sent an email to Gubanova (BOK) asking her “as part of the default on the prepayments” to “arrange for crediting the funds for the companies to pay for additional expenses, in accordance with the attached table” {E6/81/1}. The  table showed the “Funding amount for 10 companies [all Borrowers] under the Currency Contracts project until the end of 2014”, totalling UAH 136,786.76 {E6/82P/1}. Gubanova forwarded the email to Kazantsev (BOK), who emailed a group of BOK employees three days later to inform them that “Today the loans are being issued for additional court expenses” {E6/81/1}.  271 Standing back, this was Melnyk seeking loans from the Bank (a defendant to the claims) so that 10 Borrowers (of which he, Melnyk, was a purported beneficial owner of seven200) could bring claims against D3-5 (of which he was also a purported beneficial owner). 272 What all of the above demonstrates is that the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings were an entirely artificial construct, procured and pursued in collusion between the Borrowers, D3-8, Primecap, PBC (via Melnyk) and BOK.  Their purpose was in no way to secure any genuine recovery for the Borrowers (or Bank); rather, they were brought to (i) enable the Borrowers to avoid incurring substantial penalties under currency control laws (as the reference to the “Currency contracts project”{E6/82P/1} suggests); and (ii) furnish the Bank with evidence – capa"}

The exceptions are Ortika, Inkom and Paradiz.  \nAA2/1/116\n 111 G  OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF THE RELEVANT ENTITIES 273 D1-2 owned and controlled all the entities involved in perpetrating the Misappropriation, including the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers (Section G1), D3-8 (Section G2), and the Alleged Principals of D3-5 (Section G3).  G1 The Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers 274 D1-2 deny that they controlled any of the Borrowers or Intermediary Borrowers. They have, however, admitted to owning201 (i) combined majority interests in four Borrowers over parts of the period 1.4.13 to 30.9.14 – Alfatrader (90%), Dorteks (100%), Prado (c. 55%), Uniks (100%); (ii) a majority interest in one Intermediary Borrower – Autotradeinvest (100%); and (iii) minority interests in a further 20 Borrowers202 and 16 Intermediary Borrowers.203 See Schedule 6. 275 The ownership interests which D1-2 have been constrained to admit are the tip of the iceberg. In fact, they owned and controlled each of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers and have only admitted (when serving their defences in January 2020 and thereafter) interests in Borrowers held through corporate chains that they were forced to disclose pursuant to the WFO in January 2018. The Bank relies on the following: (1) The Structure Charts and Nominee Charts, which show that the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers were purportedly owned by D1-2’s nominees; (2) The efforts made within the Bank in 2015-16 to conceal D1-2’s interests in the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers; (3) The evidence showing that D1-2 controlled the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers via PBC and Primecap; (4) The inherent improbability, given the nature of the Misappropriation, that the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers were owned by anyone other than D1-2; and (5) The significance of the ownership admissions that D1-2 have been forced to make.  201  See D1Def/Sch. 5 {A1/16/1-3} and D2Def/App. A {A1/19/1} (Borrowers); D1Def/Sch. 7 {A1/17.1/1-15} and D2 RRFI {A2/39.4/1-14} (Intermediary Borrowers). D1 was ordered to provide details of his interest in Borrowers from 1.1.13 until 31.12.16, while D2’s admissions are limited to 1.4.13 to 30.9.14. 202  AEF, Agropromtechnologia, Cambel, Elsis Time (D1 only), Empire, Esmola (D1 only), Favore, Foxar, Gardera, Investgroup (D1 only) Milorin, Ortika, Faboris (D1 only), Prominmet, Ribotto, Rudnex, Tekspetmontazh and Vialint. 203  Amadoras, Centrolstal, Foks Trading, Lazarurnii Bereg, Floreks-Indastriz (D2 only), Kinan (D2 only), Letara, Mantas (D1 only), Lokasta (D2 only), Mialis, Mitsar, Stimeks, Tinto, Verisa (D1 only), Vikor M, Vinibur. \nAA2/1/117\n 112 (1) The Structure and Nominee Charts 276 The Bank has prepared a Structure Chart for each of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers which shows the ownership structure of that entity as at the date on which it first entered into a Relevant or Intermediary Loan (the ‘Snapshot Date’). The Structure Charts are found in Volumes K4-B3 (for the 50 Borrowers) and K4-B4 (for the 34 Intermediary Borrowers).

A typical Borrower Structure Chart is found at {K4-B3/1/1} (Agroprom).   277 The Bank has also prepared Nominee Charts, in Volume K4-A, which show the connections between 37 of the purported beneficial owners of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers and D1-2. A typical Nominee Chart is found at {K4-A/19/1} (Melnyk).  278 The Structure and Nominee Charts are largely agreed.204 They demonstrate that: (1) With one exception,205 where D1-2 do not admit a majority interest in the Borrower or Intermediary Borrower, the majority of the purported beneficial owners of the relevant entity are PBC or Bank employees; and (2) Each Nominee has further connections to D1-2 because: (i) D1-2 admit that the Nominee holds assets on his behalf, usually pursuant to oral agreements, and/or (ii) the Nominee was recorded at the Ukrainian corporate registry or in the Bank’s records as having a board role at a company in which D1-2 admit to having an interest.  279 The Nominees were not the true beneficial owners of the Borrowers: they acted as nominees for D1-2. The evidence supporting this conclusion is overwhelming:  (1) As set out in Section C3 above, D1-2 owned and controlled PBC. It is wholly improbable to suppose that the PBC employees who supposedly owned the Borrowers did so for themselves. They held those interests for D1-2. (2) D1-2 have not sought to identify plausible alternative beneficial owners of these companies. Indeed, when ordered to identify the other UBOs of those Borrowers in which they had admitted a minority interest, D1-2 simply identified further PBC employees.206 That is not credible: it is inherently improbable to suppose that PBC’s  204  The limited disputes are addressed in the notes to the Charts. These disputes relate only to the Bank’s reliance on certain narrow categories of document cited in the Charts, and the Defendants do not positively contend that the Charts are in any respect inaccurate in either their depiction of the relevant ownership structures or links between the Nominees and D1-2. 205  Solmbridge (purported beneficial owner is Nikita Aboyan) {K4-B3/40}. Solbridge’s directors were, however, all PBC employees: see ¶1A of the Solmbridge Statement of Fact at {F1/41/1}, and employment records for Martynenko, Pyvovar and Burkhan at {K3-C2/120},  {K3-C2/92} and {K3-C2/135} 206  D1 RRFI {A2/26/1-5}; D2 RRFI {A2/34/3}, D2 RRFI {A2/36/2}.  \nAA2/1/118\n 113 employees were the real beneficial owners of companies borrowing billions of dollars as part of a coordinated scheme to extract money from D1-2’s Bank. (3) D1-2 could have called Melnyk, the head of PBC, to attempt to defend the case that the PBC employees he managed held stakes in companies borrowing from the Bank beneficially, or that they held those stakes for other wealthy clients. But they have not done so: it is to be inferred that Melnyk was not prepared to support such a case or that D1-2 were fully aware that any attempt by him to do so would be incredible.   (4) As set out at ¶283ff below, BOK was able to change the directors and purported beneficial owners of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers without the consent of the PBC employees who supposedly owned those companies. It is inherently incredible that PBC employees were genuine beneficial owners of these companies, but yet could be shuffled like a pack of cards by Bank employees in order to persuade the NBU that the Bank was not breaching its related party lending limits. (5) In six cases, the majority interests in the company were not held by PBC employees, but by one or more then current or former Bank employees.207 The evidence is clear that Bank employee"}

It is inherently incredible that PBC employees were genuine beneficial owners of these companies, but yet could be shuffled like a pack of cards by Bank employees in order to persuade the NBU that the Bank was not breaching its related party lending limits. (5) In six cases, the majority interests in the company were not held by PBC employees, but by one or more then current or former Bank employees.207 The evidence is clear that Bank employees were used as nominee owners for companies owned or controlled by D1-2. Indeed, one of the Borrowers supposedly owned by a Bank employee – Celastrina – was admitted by D1 to be owned or controlled by him in the Pinchuk Proceedings (see ¶312(2) below). And again D1-2 could have called these individuals to give evidence, but have chosen not to do so.  (6) D2’s 2007 and 2008 Asset Lists, prepared by Anischenko, provide yet further confirmation. They show that even at that time, D1-2 were already using 13 of the PBC nominees who acted as nominee owners of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers e.g. {E1/11P/15} {E1/12P/1}. And they record – six years before the Misappropriation – D1-2’s ownership (through PBC nominees) of companies which became Borrowers, including AEF and Rapit (as well as their ownership of D5 (Collyer) and D4’s Principal, Brimmilton): {E1/11P/4, 18} {E1/29P/3}. (7) The Borrowers all participated in the Misappropriation in a near-identical fashion, making it inherently improbable that they were owned/controlled by different people: ¶307 below.   207  These individuals respectively left their employment at the Bank in 2007, 2009, 2015 and (in three cases) 2017: {K3-C2/34}; {K3-C2/17}; {K3-C2/129}; {K3-C2/101}; {K3-C2/112}; {K3-C2/148}. \nAA2/1/119\n 114 (8) In the period 2013-16, the directors of the majority of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers were also PBC employees: POC/Sch. 6 {A1/7.1/1-31}. Again, Bank employees were able to recommend and then procure changes to the PBC directors of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers.  (9) Even where the Structure Charts identify certain individuals as purported beneficial owners who were neither PBC nor Bank employees, those individuals have important links with D1-2.208  (2) The shareholding companies and individuals 280 The Structure Charts also identify the immediate and intermediate shareholders of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers. These mainly consisted of offshore companies and Cypriot individuals. By way of example, Agroprom’s shares were held by four offshore companies (Dannielli, Croniex, Grandos, Prior Management) and one Delaware company (Modena), and the shares in four of those companies were in turn held by three Cypriot individuals (Sofocleous, Pitsillidou and Georgiou): {K4-B3/1/1}.  281 As to the entities and individuals involved in the ownership structure of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers:  (1) Of the 110 intermediate shareholding companies, 54 appear in D1-2’s Asset Disclosure as holding assets on their behalf; 57 were Lafferty Spreadsheet Companies (i.e. companies from which D1 was able to procure their bank statements); 9 are Share Pledge Companies (i.e. companies whose shares were pledged to the Bank or which pledged shares to the Bank). These companies also appear in D1-2’s disclosed contemporaneous asset lists and in the structures by which D1 and D2 admit holding their interests in the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers between 2013 and 2016: see Schedules 6 and 7.  (2) Only 11 of the intermediate shareholding companies do not fall into any of these categories.

At least 71 are employees or former employees of the Cypriot CSPs identified in ¶98.  See Schedule 7.  282 In short, an analysis of the holding structures used to hold shares in the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers shows that many of the same entities and individuals were used as were used by D1-2 to hold their admitted assets: that provides yet further confirmation of D1-2’s ownership of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers. (3) Concealment of D1-2’s interests in the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers 283 From February 2015 onwards, D1-2’s inner circle at the Bank went to significant lengths to conceal D1-2’s interests in the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers from the NBU. Three examples below are given below.   (a) The Luchaninov Email 284 On 5.2.15, a Ukrainian anti-corruption organisation called ‘NashiGroshi’ (or ‘OurMoney’) published two online articles alleging that D1-2 companies had misappropriated US$1.8bn from the Bank using loans to 42 of the Borrowers and “fictitious import contracts” (i.e. the RSAs) (the “NashiGroshi Articles”): {E7/276.1/1} {E7/276.2/1}. On 12.2.15, the NBU issued ‘Request 27’ seeking documents and written explanations in relation to the lending to those 42 Borrowers {E7/307.2/1}. It followed up with an unscheduled inspection order and further requests, seeking information about the Bank’s related parties (Inspection Order: {E8/129.2}, {E8/129.5}; Request 1 {E8/129.8}, Request 2 {E8/143.2}).  285 On receipt, Request 27 was sent to BOK “for consideration”{E7/307.4/2}. Pikush then instructed Luchaninov (the Bank’s then director of compliance) to organise an investigation of “the facts of disclosure that led to publication of bank secrets related to transactions of bank customers in  209  Austen Ltd; Croniex Holdings Ltd; Elite Systems Ltd; Entry7 LLC; Ferona LLC (with the exception of Vitaliy Tymshyn, one of five purported UBOs); Prime Group LLC; Quentional Investments Ltd; Rontex Inc; Southfield Admin Ltd.  210  They were: (i) Dmitry Potishman, who is the purported UBO of intermediate shareholder Eltima Investments Ltd, which holds a 10% stake in Alfatrader (a Borrower in which D1 and D2 admit a combined 90% interest) {K4-B3/2/1}; and (ii) Yevgen Zasimenko, the purported UBO of intermediate shareholder Bersel Inc, which held a minority indirect stake in Borrower Elsis Time {K4-B3/9/1}. Zasimenko’s connections to D1 and D2 are set out at {K4-A/36/1}. \nAA2/1/121\n 116 the [NashiGroshi] article”; Luchaninov informed Aleksander Sokolovskiy (‘Head of the Internal Control and Fraud Management Division’) who responded: “if I understand correctly, the request concerns shareholder companies”. 286 Luchaninov explains that, shortly thereafter, he “attended a meeting with a number of the Bank’s senior managers, including … Yatsenko, … Gurieva and … Pikush” where he was “provided with a list of 42 Ukrainian companies, all of which were clients of BOK” and asked to “analyse whether there were any connections evident from the client information held by the Bank that would link the 42 Companies to the Bank’s then owners, i.e. [D1] and [D2]; and if any such connections were evident, [to] provide guidance on how those connections could be removed”: Luchaninov/¶¶52-53 {B1/3/14}.

Three things are striking about this. First, the instruction came from individuals at the Bank who formed part of D1-2’s inner circle. Second, Luchaninov was directed to look only at the connections which were apparent from the client information held by the Bank. Third, he was not asked to establish whether or not there was non-compliance – he was asked “if any such connections were evident, provide guidance on how those connections could be removed”.  287 On 31.3.15, Luchaninov emailed Pikush, Yatsenko and Novikov the requested analysis (his email was forwarded the next day to Gurieva): the “Luchaninov Email” {E8/160/1} {E8/163/1}. Entitled “client analysis”, he wrote:  “Hello, in reference to the unplanned audit by the National Bank of Ukraine of 42 clients who previously received loans from PrivatBank and made advance payments under international contracts [sc. the RSAs], the attached file contains a preliminary analysis of the structure of connections of these loan clients. Considering that there is the risk of connections of lending operations to refinancing and persons related to the bank, the document provides suggestions on the removal of such connections.” The Luchaninov Email {E8/160/1}  288 The first attachment to the Luchaninov Email, entitled “Analysis of legal cases of clients BOK_42 companies” {E8/161}, explained that 24 of the Borrowers were “potential insiders” for the purposes of the Law on Banks, but that they were “not included in the quarterly [related-party] list due to risk-relevant relations and violations of ratios”. In relation to each of those 24 companies, Luchaninov indicated that either (i) the Borrower could replace one of its directors or (ii) the same director could be removed from a different company owned and controlled by D1-2. For example, the first two entries read as follows: \nAA2/1/122\n 117  289 These Borrowers (Agroprom and Alfatrader) are companies in which D1-2 have admitted an interest during the Relevant Period. As for the related companies, D1-2 have admitted in their Asset Disclosure that they each hold 16.82% of PrJSC Sintez Oil (part of their ‘Oil Transhipment Holding’)211 and the Ukrainian corporate registry records them as being UBOs of PJSC Kremenchuk Steel Works (“KSW”) {K3-A6/130.1} {K3-A6/347}. The directors identified in this extract (Karnaukh and Kravchenko) are PBC employees and admitted nominees of D1-2, holding assets for them pursuant to oral agreements: {K4-A/12/1} {K4-A/16/1}. 290 The second attachment to the Luchaninov Email {E8/165} was entitled “Analysis_ different format”. It explains how the risk of exposure of the affiliation between the Borrower and the other relevant D1-2 company arose. The Alfatrader entry reads:       291 By the above entry, Luchaninov explained that (i) D1 (KIV) and D2 (BGB) owned a 48.44% share in PJSC KSW through Defano Investments Ltd (Cyprus) and Bredlaw Investment Ltd (BVI);212 (ii) Kravchenko (as noted above, a PBC employee and admitted nominee of D1-2) was a member of the supervisory board of KSW213 and also a director of Alfatrader; and (iii)  211  D1 U/R, Asset 53 {J2/3/67}; D2 U/R, Asset 69 {J4/5/69}. 212  Because D1-2 indirectly held a “substantial participation” in PJSC KSW (defined as a direct or indirect ownership share of more than 10%), it was a “horizontal affiliate” of the Bank within the meaning of the Law on Banks. 213  Kravchenko was therefore also a related party of the Bank, pursuant to Article 52(1)(6) of the Law on Banks (version as amended by Law 218-VIII of 2.3.15), because he was an “execu"}

This was done on an industrial scale: the 24 Borrowers had a total indebtedness of US$619,460,391. (2) Luchaninov proceeded on the basis that either of his options – removing individuals as directors of the Borrowers, or removing them from the supervisory board of other related parties – could be implemented (he says: “[a]t the time, I thought that Mr Pikush, Mr Yatsenko and/or Mr Novikov could influence the changes that needed to be made”: Luchaninov/¶57 {B1/3/14}). Given that this understanding had been generated by D1-2’s lieutenants, it is strong evidence that D1-2 owned the 24 Borrowers.  (3) The majority of the directors whose removal or replacement was recommended were employees of PBC, and are identified by D1-2 as nominees in their Asset Disclosure. Again, this is strong evidence of D1-2’s ownership of the 24 Borrowers. (b) The Rokoman Spreadsheet 294 On 31.7.15, Rokoman (BOK) emailed Gurieva (the “Rokoman Email”) {E10/264/1} with the subject “Proposals for Interrelated Counterparties”. She said this: “The attachment contains two spreadsheets: ‘counterparties group -suggestions for directors’ and ‘change of beneficiary owners’. At the first stage we suggest replacing directors with new ones, which will significantly reduce concentrations across all groups, and 15 groups will be normalised. At the second stage, beneficiary owners should be changed; this information has already been provided.” The Rokoman Email {E10/264/1}  214  Alfatrader fell within Article 52(1)(8) of the Law on Banks (version as amended by Law 218-VIII of 2.3.15) because it was one of the “legal entities in which the natural persons indicated herein are executives ....” \nAA2/1/124\n 119  295 Rokoman envisaged changing the directors and/or beneficial owners of 31 offshore companies, so as to avoid them being classified as related parties and to reduce the ‘group’ debt associated with their nominal beneficial owners. The finer detail of her proposals went through a few iterations in early August 2015 ({E10/269/1}, {E10/270P/1}), and on 6.8.15 updated proposals were provided: {E10/279.1}, {E10/279.2P/1}, {E10/279.3P/1}. 296 The “first stage” of Rokoman’s updated proposal is described in a spreadsheet entitled “Groups (upd).xls” (the “Rokoman Directors Spreadsheet”) {E10/279.2P}. It contained a list of directors of 82 companies who “must be excluded”, including the directors of 22 Borrowers215 and 23 Intermediary Borrowers.216 Those companie"}

It contained a list of directors of 82 companies who “must be excluded”, including the directors of 22 Borrowers215 and 23 Intermediary Borrowers.216 Those companies included Uniks, in which D1-2 have admitted 100% beneficial ownership: {A1/16/3} (D1) and {A1/19/3} (D2). 297 The detail of the “second stage” (i.e. the proposal to change beneficial owners) of the updated proposals was found in a file called “Change B (upd)” (the “Updated Rokoman Spreadsheet”) {E10/279.3P/1}. It consists of a single tab entitled “Change of Beneficial Owners” and identifies nine beneficial owners of offshore companies using a cypher in the form B20, B3, B8, B32, etc. The cypher can be decrypted using a spreadsheet prepared in the Cyprus Branch on 8.5.15 which gives an alpha-numeric code to each purported beneficial owner (the “Beneficiary Key”): {E9/171P/1}.217 For each beneficiary, the Updated Rokoman Spreadsheet identifies the companies of which s/he is a beneficiary; the proposed replacement beneficiary; whether the beneficiary has already been changed/needed to be changed/should not be changed; and the reduction in group debt which the change would produce (i.e. the debt associated with a group of companies connected to a particular individual). This is the proposal for B20 (Vadym Pereviznyi): \n  215  Orbela, Vesta-Company, Solmbridge, AEF, Raneya, Metrikom, Empire, Uniks, Milorin, Agroprom, Viitella, Saltiz, Vialint, Techspetz, Tseris, Industrial Garant, Imris, Prominmet, Viglon, Favore, Inkeriya, Rapit. 216  Skybud, Spekr, Stimeks, Lazurnii Bereg, Murey, Versaliya, Mialis, Gilbert, Prudis, RK Profit, Floreks-Indastriz, Centrostal, Aftotradeinvest, Anabis, Betenkort, Vinibur, Mantas, Bienga, Verisa, Mondial, Mizar, Vikor M, Lokasta.  217  The Beneficiary Key and its cypher system appears to have come about because Yatsenko denied a request for details relating to nominee and beneficial owners of customers of the Cyprus branch to be shared with the Bank’s risk management department: {E5/189}. \nAA2/1/125\n 120 298 Not all of the changes proposed in the Updated Rokoman Spreadsheet were put into effect.218 But many were implemented shortly after 6.8.15. 299 21 of the companies identified in the Updated Rokoman Spreadsheet were shareholders in one or more of the Borrowers. Of those 21 companies (i) five were recorded as “P” (Please change), of which only one shareholder in fact changed its beneficiary;219 (ii) five were recorded as “N” (no change), none of which changed beneficiary before nationalisation; and (iii) 13 were recorded as “beneficiary changed”: in all of those cases, the beneficiary is recorded in the shareholders’ account fact sheets filed with the Bank’s Cyprus branch as having changed around the time of the Updated Rokoman Spreadsheet. See Schedule 3.  300 At the risk of stating the obvious, these were not genuine changes of beneficial ownership. The old and the ‘new’ beneficial owners were principally PBC employees. D1-2 were simply shuffling the deck to hide related party borrowing.   301 The Updated Rokoman Spreadsheet is self-evidently an important and revealing document: (i) it records the way D1-2 held their interests in various Borrowers through offshore companies, purportedly owned by PBC employees; (ii) it was prepared to allow the manipulation of the ostensible ownership of the Bank’s borrowers by those PBC employees so as to avoid breaching the limits on lending to groups of associated borrowers (the N7 ratio: Beketov8/¶466 {C1/1/152}); (iii) it was an obviously sensitive document, as is demonstrated by the need to use the Beneficiary Key to decrypt the names of purported beneficiaries; and ("}

The fact that BOK was able to propose such changes confirms the nominee status of the purported owners. (c) The 165 List and the Avellum Emails 302 From August 2015 onward, the Bank took concerted action to conceal D1-2’s interests in the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers. This was primarily driven by the NBU’s 31.7.15 letter which provisionally designated 165 companies – including Borrowers – as ‘related parties’ (the “31.7.15 NBU Letter” and the “165 List”: {E10/266}) and invited the Bank to set out its position. The Bank responded as follows:  218  For example, Artem Zamsha remained the beneficiary of Bolroot Commercial despite the “P” (please change) request, and while Mr Perevizny was no longer recorded as a beneficiary of Lexus Enterprises on 15.9.15, he was replaced by Yulia Burkhan rather than Andriy Akudovich (B3) {K3-B/355}. 219  B8 (Mr Kolobkov) was replaced as beneficial owner of Alpha International Holdings (a shareholder in Tsersis) on 26.10.15: {K3-B/35} {K3-B/35L/1}.  \nAA2/1/126\n 121 303 In September and October 2015, the Bank took advice from the Ukrainian law firm Avellum about how to respond to the 31.7.15 NBU Letter and, in particular, reduce the number of related parties on the 165 List. Avellum’s advice was that the Bank would either have to “disclose the company ownership structure all the way up to the beneficial owners” or “adjust the company’s ownership structure so that none of the group’s insiders have any influence over the company (by removing insiders from the ownership structure or reducing their ownership interests / stakes)” {E11/123/3}. Given that the first option was an obvious non-starter, Avellum advised the Bank on how to engage in a mass replacement of nominal beneficial owners of c. 100 of the 165 List companies: {E11/265/1}. One proposal was to consider “the acquisition of [about 100 companies] by one or several beneficiaries on the same day” {E11/265/2} (original emphasis). Avellum’s emails were forwarded to Melnyk at PBC: {E11/123/1}; {E11/265/1}.  304 Meanwhile, repeated proposals were made to remove directors and purported beneficial owners from various Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers to hide related party lending. Two examples are set out below (more are found in Schedule 3):  (1) On 9.10.15, Luchaninov, still acting pursuant to his orders from the Bank’s senior managers, sent Yatsenko a draft email for him to send to Novikov, stating “please organise a task to oversee the process of changing the beneficial owners in the client companies, according to the attached list” and attaching a list of 10 companies, including four Borrowers and one Intermediary Borrower, with debts of UAH 12bn (c. US$563m).220 Luchaninov explained that “in order to solve the problem of relatedness of companies where the owner is a current insider of the bank, it is necessary to (1) terminate the existing relationship between the real beneficiary and the nominal beneficiaries (if any) and (2) to conclude a trust agreement (trust declaration) between the nominal beneficiaries and the new real beneficiary, who will not be a bank insider.”221 Later that day Luchaninov sent Yatsenko a (password protected) “table describing the structure of 10 clients”.222  (2) On 20.11.15, Luchaninov emailed Yatse"}

The attachment showed “a list of 28 companies from the list of credit concentrations is provided for disaffiliating with recognized persons. Total debt of UAH 9.5 billion. […] Information was disclosed to T.Yu. [sc. Novikov] employees” {E12/31P/1}.  220  {E11/267/1} {E11/268/1}. The list included four Borrowers (Invest Group, Favore, Tseris, and Tamersa) and one Intermediary Borrower (Anabis).  221  Those English law agreements created bare trusts over the relevant company shares: see {E11/269}. 222  {E11/272/1}, {E11/273/1}. \nAA2/1/127\n 122 Luchaninov’s table included seven Borrowers and three Intermediary Borrowers223 and set out proposals to change the directors of the borrowers or their related companies (owned by D1-2).  305 These documents, and the conduct of the Bank’s senior leadership (i.e. D1-2’s inner circle) in proposing the removal/replacement of directors and beneficial owners, provides yet further confirmation that these are D1-2 entities: (i) the process was not driven by any third-party owners of the Borrowers or Intermediary Borrowers; (ii) the nominee directors and beneficial owners were a fungible pool of (mainly PBC) individuals who could be swapped as and when required. There were no genuine changes of beneficial ownership; and (iii)the option of disclosing D1-2 as the true owners was consistently eschewed. (4) Control via PBC and Primecap 306 D1-2 controlled the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers, including via PBC and Primecap. D1-2 deny that they exercised any such control. The Bank’s case on the role played by PBC and Primecap generally is covered in Sections C3 and C4. In particular, the documents demonstrate that PBC and/or Primecap employees: (i) procured the execution of documents on behalf of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers; (ii) instigated loans to the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers; and (iii) organised the collusive 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings. PBC and Primecap did not do all of that on their own: they must have taken instructions from someone. The overwhelming inference is that they took instructions from D1-2, acting through Novikov (the Primecap “boss”) and Melnyk (PBC’s manager). (5) Inherent probabilities  307 It is inherently probable, especially given D1 and D2’s admissions of interests in 21 and 19 of the Borrowers respectively, that D1-2 owned the remaining Borrowers: (1) The Borrowers participated in the Misappropriation in a near-identical fashion: they entered into loans with the Bank on near identical terms following a desultory approval process, they entered into obviously uncommercial RSAs with D3-8, and they colluded in obtaining judgments in the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings. Indeed, the Ukrainian Borrowers were grouped together in the Gurieva and Kazantsev Spreadsheets. It is inherently improbable that the Borrowers were beneficially owned and/or controlled by different people.   223  Borrowers: Prominmet, Imris, Vesta-Company, Tamersa, Techspets, Vitella, Intorno; Intermediary Borrowers: Stimeks, Centrolstal, Mantas.  \nAA2/1/128\n 123 (2) The Relevant Loans were approved by D1-2’s lieutenants, as described in ¶197 above. All of them had full visibility of the sham nature of the transactions. Accordingly, if this was not a fraud perpetrated by D1-2 on the Bank through those lieutenants, then it was a fraud perpetrated by D1-2’s lieutenants, using D1-2’s own companies, against D1-2’s bank.  But that is an overwhelmingly "}
{"start": 350000, "text": "Tamersa, Techspets, Vitella, Intorno; Intermediary Borrowers: Stimeks, Centrolstal, Mantas.  \nAA2/1/128\n 123 (2) The Relevant Loans were approved by D1-2’s lieutenants, as described in ¶197 above. All of them had full visibility of the sham nature of the transactions. Accordingly, if this was not a fraud perpetrated by D1-2 on the Bank through those lieutenants, then it was a fraud perpetrated by D1-2’s lieutenants, using D1-2’s own companies, against D1-2’s bank.  But that is an overwhelmingly unlikely explanation, which has never been advanced by D1-2. On the contrary, rather than seek to blame them for what happened, D1-2 have maintained close relationships with their lieutenants after nationalisation, as the belated WhatsApp disclosure confirms. (3) The Relevant and Intermediary Drawdowns (with the exception of those made by Prominmet and Tamersa) were ultimately purportedly repaid by the Asset Transfer and Transformation. The assets used in the Asset Transfer belonged to D1-2 and the New Borrowers were owned and controlled by D1-2. This is only explicable if D1-2 owned the Borrowers. 308 The Relevant Loans and c. 90% of the Intermediary Loans224 were purportedly secured by the Share Pledges, granted by further companies admittedly owned and controlled by D1-2.225 Again, this is only explicable if D1-2 owned the Borrowers. (6) D1-2’s limited admissions 309 As set out in Schedule 6, D1-2 have (i) admitted a majority interest in four Borrowers and one Intermediary Borrower and (ii) admitted minority interests in a further 18 Borrowers and 16 Intermediary Borrowers. As to this: 310 First, D1-2’s admissions that they held majority interests in four Borrowers is significant: (1) The Borrowers were used in near-identical ways, and so this is strong evidence pointing to D1-2’s ownership and control of the other Borrowers. (2) Despite their admissions of majority (or sole) ownership, D1-2 have not adduced any evidence to explain why Alfatrader, Dorteks, Prado and Uniks entered into 10 Relevant and Intermediary Loans between 17.2.14 and 3.9.14 with a cumulative value of US$99m and UAH 1.66bn: {F1/4/1} (Alfatrader), {F1/9/1} (Dorteks), {F1/32/1} (Prado), {F1/46/1} (Uniks). The reason for this is obvious: there is no innocent explanation.  (3) Despite their admission of 100% interests (or near-100% interests) in Alfatrader,  224  Bank RRFI/¶36(b)(v) {A2/4/32}; Bank RRFI/¶18(c)(vi) {A2/9/16}. 225  POC/¶19(a) {A1/2/10}; Reply/¶5 {A1/25/6}; D1Def/Sch. 6 {A1/17}. \nAA2/1/129\n 124 Uniks and Dorteks, D1-2 maintain that they had no control over these companies {A1/8/15} (¶20) (D1); {A1/18/13} (¶30). This is fanciful: of course D1-2 had control over their own companies, who were administered via PBC/Primecap. A fortiori when those companies were entering into c. US$200m+ of loans with D1-2’s own bank. In the case of D2, this can be demonstrated by one of the small number of documents he has disclosed from 2013-15: {E1/273/1} is an example of D2, on 13.3.13, giving instructions in relation to the affairs of what Novikov describes as “5 PBC companies”, including Dorteks and Uniks.  311 Second, D1-2’s admissions suggest that their interests in the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers fluctuated, often significantly, between 2013 and 2016. This is extraordinary: (1) D1 says that he had a “45% indirect interest” in Alfatrader from 1.4.13 to 21.7.15 (when it entered into a Relevant Loan for UAH160m), no interest in Alfatrader between 21.7.15 and 25.2.16, and then a “20% indirect interest” from 25.2.16 {A1/16/1}. But he does not explain why he sold his interest in a company with indebtedness of UAH156,354,321 to his bank in July 2015 (or who would have bought this interest); nor why he re-acquired a 20% interest in Alfatrader in 25.2.16 (when that indebtedness was still outstanding {A1/13/1}). Nor is there any disclosure in relation to these matters. Similar points arise in relation to D1’s fluctuating interests in Favore, Prado, Ribotto and Rudnex "}
{"start": 353500, "text": " then a “20% indirect interest” from 25.2.16 {A1/16/1}. But he does not explain why he sold his interest in a company with indebtedness of UAH156,354,321 to his bank in July 2015 (or who would have bought this interest); nor why he re-acquired a 20% interest in Alfatrader in 25.2.16 (when that indebtedness was still outstanding {A1/13/1}). Nor is there any disclosure in relation to these matters. Similar points arise in relation to D1’s fluctuating interests in Favore, Prado, Ribotto and Rudnex {A1/16/1-3}.   (2) D2 says that he had no interest in AEF on 3.4.13, 20.9.13 or 24.9.13 (when it entered into Relevant Loans of US$32m, US$34m and UAH 100m respectively), but that two months later on 20.11.13 some 8.91% of AEF’s shares became “indirectly held by a nominee on bare trust for [him]” {A1/19/1}. No explanation is given for why this was felt to be a propitious time to acquire an interest in a shell company with huge liabilities to D2’s own bank (or why D2 decided to acquire a further 0.09% interest on 11.2.14 (ibid.)). Nor is there any disclosure on these issues. Similar points can be made in relation to D2’s fluctuating interests in Faboris, Favore, Gardera and Prominmet: {A1/19/1-3}. (3) This is all absurd: why would D1-2 be acquiring interests in shell companies which were heavily indebted to their Bank (as in the AEF example). And why would any third-party purchaser be remotely interested in buying shares in such companies (as in the Alfatrader example)? The reality is that this was all part of the game of cat and mouse played by BOK, PBC and Primecap of hiding the Bank’s related party lending \nAA2/1/130\n 125 by shuffling the ownership of Borrowers to obscure the true picture from the NBU.   312 Third, there is evidence to undermine certain of the denials advanced by D1-2 as to ownership and control over Borrowers. For example: (1) As the Court is aware, D1 claims that he obtained the bank statements of all but one of the Borrowers and 13 of the Intermediary Borrowers in late December and early January 2018 in order to compile the Lafferty Spreadsheets.226 The Court has already held that D1 controlled the documents of those companies {A5/15/12} [40]. But the Court could and should go further: it is ridiculous to suppose that D1 was able to obtain hundreds of thousands of pages of hard-copy bank statements from these companies in short order (see the photograph at {H1/50.1}), but was unable to control their affairs more widely. (2) D1 denies ownership and control of the Borrower, Celastrina, between April 2013 and September 2014: D1Def/¶20A {A1/8/18}. Yet in the Pinchuk Proceedings Celastrina wrote a letter to the Bank’s Cypriot branch on or shortly before 8.8.14 stating that “Celastrina Trading Co Ltd … is owned or controlled by Mr Kolomoisky, who is required to disclose … all relevant documents that are, or have been, in his control ….” {E5/157.2/21}.227 D1 has amended his case as to his admitted interests in the Borrowers on at least three occasions; but has never admitted ownership or control of Celastrina. That is a striking lie. (3) D2 received updates by email from Igor Volokovoy (who administered assets for him)228 on payments to be made to and from Fiastra (including dividends) on 3.7.13 and 7.4.14: {E2/43/1} {E3/180/1}. Similarly, on 16.1.13, Volokovoy emailed D2 explaining that Fiastra had received a profit of UAH 63.7m (US$7.8m) “from the sale of KSW products in Privat companies” {E1/239/1-2}. Yet Fiastra – which entered into a Relevant Loan on 3.3.14 – is not one of the Borrowers in which he admits an ownership interest {A1/19/1}. (4) As noted above, Sokolovskiy (head of the Bank’s ‘Internal Control and Fraud Management Division’) correctly appreciated that the 42 Borrowers identified in the  226  These entities are listed in the Order of Mr Justice Trower dated 25.6.21 {A6/63/5} (pp. 5, 6 and 9-12). 227  D1’s solicitors said the same thing in evidence, and this was further confirmed in D1’s disclosure stateme"}

Volokovoy was not a custodian identified by D2 for the purposes of his disclosure exercise. \nAA2/1/131\n 126 NashiGroshi Articles as having been involved in the Misappropriation were “shareholder companies” {E7/307.4/1}. (5) Other Bank staff frequently connected Borrowers to underlying assets owned by D1-2, including Hotel Split (in which at least D2 held an interest229). For example, Kazantsev (BOK) sent an email on 14.1.14 with the subject line “Replacement by new borrowers”, which said as follows: “Changing horses … We are preparing new lines for: ORTIKA LLC … (instead of ALFATRADER LLC) (industry – tourism, project – Split Hotel -- $50,000,000 + UAH for 1 year capitalisation; RIBOTTO LLC … (instead of MIZAR LLC) (industry – tourism, project – Split Hotel) - $50,000,000 + UAH for 1 year capitalisation […]” Kasantsev email of 14.1.14 {E3/10/1}230 313 Fourth, the Court may ask itself why D1-2 felt that they needed to make any admissions of ownership at all? That is, of course, a question for D1-2 to answer. But the reason appears to be because there was already a paper trail connecting D1-2 to the admitted companies. The majority of D2’s admissions231 relate to companies held underneath a company called Modena Holdings LLC, incorporated in Delaware. That company is identified (i) in related-party shareholder representation letters to the Bank’s auditors produced in early 2016 {E14/265/9} (no. 291), (ii) in draft related party disclosures as an entity “controlled” by D2,232 (iii) as 100% owned by D2 in his pleading in the Tatneft Proceedings {I3/27/9} (¶25(1)), and (iv) in his 2018 Asset Disclosure, given on 18.1.18, c. two years before he was required to plead his Defence in these proceedings {J4/3/36}. The rest of his admitted interests are also each held via at least one company that appears in his 2018 and/or 2019 asset disclosure. As for D1, with one exception,233 his admissions are in respect of interests ultimately held by companies in which he admitted an interest in his 2018 asset disclosure. Further detail is  229  See {E1/95/3}, {E1/116}, {E1/143}, {E1/266.1} and {E3/10}. 230  Of these companies, D2 has admitted a 45% interest in Alfatrader, a c. 20% interest in Ortika, a 2.95% interest in Ribotto (all Borrowers) and 3.04% interest in Mitsar (an Intermediary Borrower). Similar documents are found at (i) {E2/223}: Real-Standart (Borrower) linked with the Kievguma building project (Kievguma being an admitted asset: {A1/17/1}, but D1-2 not admitting any interest in Real-Standart); (ii) {K6/26/2}: Real-Standart, Empire and Uniks being identified as “builders” for the “Euroarena” project (as noted, D1-2 admit an 100% interest in Uniks and no interest in Real-Standart; they admit very small interests in Empire); and (iii) {E2/230P} Vesta, Tseris and Inkom 2001 (Borrowers, in respect of which D1-2 do not admit interests) being assigned to D1-2’s ISFP project (the Ilyichevsk Marine Fish Port) (D1 U/R Asset 64 {J2/3/90}. 231  12 Borrowers and 8 Intermediary Borrowers: see Schedule 6. 232  {E15/310.1/1}, {E15/310.2/2}, {E15/310.3/1}. 233  Jaco Management Limited, a holding company for Intermediary Borrower Avtotradeinvest {A1/17.1/1}.  \nAA2/1/132\n 127 found in Sch"}

As the Bank’s Structure Charts show, the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers are held in very similar structures to those by which D1-2 hold their disclosed assets: a chain of companies ending with a PBC individual held out as the ultimate beneficial owner. The only difference is that with their disclosed assets D1-2 have admitted that the PBC individuals are acting as their nominees pursuant to undocumented arrangements, whereas they have refused to make the same admission in respect of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers and, absurdly, have identified the PBC individuals as genuine UBOs of the Borrowers {A2/26/2} {A2/34/2}. There are two main points to make about this:  (1) First, as observed by Bryan J in NBT at [514] {M1/22/182}, the concept of a ‘nominee UBO’ is a “inherently dishonest and deceptive”. That same dishonesty and deception is being practised by D1 and D2 on this Court in maintaining their denials of ownership and control of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers.   (2) Secondly, the PBC individuals identified as the nominal UBOs of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers are plainly nominees: that is what they did, and it is the only explanation for the chopping and changing apparent from the Luchaninov Email, Updated Rokoman Spreadsheet and Avellum Email. That being so, the question for the Court is: whose nominees were they? And in circumstances where D1-2 admit using identical structures and the very same people as nominees (usually pursuant to oral agreements, there is only one answer. G2 D3-8 315 The Bank alleges that D3-8 were, from January 2013 at the latest, ultimately owned and controlled by D1-2: POC/¶12 {A1/2/3}. This is denied by D1: D1Def/¶¶10(1), 26 {A1/8/7}. D2 (remarkably) only denies this allegation “to the best of his knowledge and recollection”: D2Def/¶¶16-18, 33(1) {A1/18/7, 17}. It is also denied by D3-8 themselves: D3-8Def/¶11(1) {A1/20/2}. The Bank relies on the following matters: (1) The purported beneficial owners of D3-8 were in fact nominees for D1-2. That is evident from (i) the Bank’s Nominee Charts; (ii) D1-2’s relationships with  234  {A5/26/9} (¶32). \nAA2/1/133\n 128 Romanovksy and Kiperman (purported beneficial owners of D6 and D7 respectively); and (iii) D1-2’s long-standing connections to D3-5. (2) D1-2 directly or indirectly control the affairs of D3-8. That is evident from (i) the ability of Primecap to direct D3-8’s affairs, including their participation in the Misappropriation; (ii) D1-2’s ability to procure D3-8’s involvement in legal proceedings for D1-2’s own benefit; (iii) D1-2’s funding of D3-8’s legal fees in these proceedings; and (iv) the nature of D6-8’s Asset Disclosure.

As explained above at 91, he held 11 assets for D1 (c. US$183m) and 19 assets for D2 (c.

He was a PBC employee who was a purported beneficial owner of 15 Borrowers and 12 Intermediary Borrowers and he replaced Melnyk as the purported beneficial owner of Cristalmax (a Lafferty Spreadsheet Company) following the Rokoman Email (see Schedule 3).247 He holds 10 assets for D1 pursuant to oral agreements and 20 assets for D2 pursuant to such agreements {K4-A/24} (green boxes).  321 Ivlev’s nominee chart is at {K4-A/11}.

It is wholly improbable to suppose that D6 was ultimately owned by Romanovsky: (1) He has not come forward to explain his ownership of D6 or how he used this company.  (2) D6 made an unsecured loan of €44m to D1’s sister Larisa Chertok, which was outstanding in 2013: {E3/337/1}.  (3) On 18.1.16 Natalja Shvackha (of the Bank’s compliance department) emailed Luchaninov and Valeriy Bagno (also of that department) proposing to remove Romanovsky as beneficial owner of D6 or alternatively replace him as the chair of Eksimnaftoproduct.251 Although he remained in both positions, the fact that the Bank thought it was able to make such a proposal makes clear that Romanovsky was not the genuine beneficial owner of D6.  (4) D3-8’s evidence and pleading in relation to D6 contains basic errors, for example, in stating that Romanovsky was the registered shareholder of D6, which he was not (see e.g. {E7/101/1}). Kyriakou (D6’s director) also filed evidence on 2.3.18 which stated: “I am a nominee director of Rossyn. Rossyn was able to comply with the asset disclosure orders made against it in these proceedings only by seeking information from its ultimate beneficial owners, who are in the Ukraine”: Kyriakou2/¶6 {H4/15/2}. It is clear that she had been told that there were multiple UBOs of D6. Within weeks of this evidence, however, D3-8 claimed that D6 only had a single UBO, Romanovsky.   249  D1 U/R (asset 50) {J2/3/57}; D2 U/R (asset 66) {J4/5/59}. 250  D1 U/R (asset 51) {J2/3/60}; D2 U/R (asset 67) {J4/5/62}; and {E1/181.3}. 251  {E12/178/1}, {E12/179/1}, {E12/179.1/1}, {E12/179.2P} (the same spreadsheet proposed changes to the beneficial ownership of Celastrina – a Borrower and Share Pledgor over which D1 admitted ownership and/or control in the Pinchuk Proceedings). \nAA2/1/137\n 132 325 The purported beneficial owner of D7 is Mykhaylo Kiperman, who was also the supposed beneficial owner of D8 until 31.3.14: (1) Mykhaylo Kiperman and his father Yuriy have been business associates of D1-2 for decades. Mykhaylo holds assets for D1-2 and has corporate roles at D1-2’s companies (see {K4-A/14}); father and son both had extensions on the ‘Black’  (which was supposedly set up and operated by Mykhaylo);252 they appear to hold minority interests in several of D1-2’s major assets (including 1+1 Production;253 Odesnaftoproduct {E17/340.3/3}; and Chormosky Fuel Terminal {E17/340.2/3}); and they have been put forward as purported beneficial owners of assets transferred to the Bank as part of the Asset Transfer. (2) It is clear that the Kiperman family’s assets were ultimately under the control of D1-2, to be called upon if required. For example:  (a) In March 2015, Plyska (BOK) and Chernyshev (BOK) discussed over Skype which petrol stations could be pledged as security to the Bank:  Plyska “Artem, why the hell did you go and leave joint stock companies among the most expensive ones?  … Fix the list, there should not be any JSC!!!  Chernyshev “OK …maybe at the same time we’ll remove DP Optima-770-Ch and DP Optima-770-R…” Plyska “Why?” Chernyshev “because of the owner” Plyska “Kiperman?” Chernyshev “Yeah … I think there may be problems with signing” Plyska “There should be no problem there, TYu [sc. Novikov] will push it through” Plyska “This is an order from IVK, so no one will resist there” [emphasis added] Skype chat between Plyska and Chernyshev on 27.3.15 {K6/70.1/3} (b) On 15.6.15 Chmona messaged D1 with a request from Yuri Kiperman to carry out transactions for the sale of various ore and other products.

It appears Kiperman needed D1’s approval before doing so: {K5-A1/11/3}.  (c) On 16.8.16, D1 messaged Rozkhova (NBU) proposing the transfer of particular petrol stations to the Bank as part of the Asset Transfer. The list included those which he now says were owned by the Kipermans as well as  252  {K5-E/2/1-2}; {K5-E/3/2} (Mykhaylo only); Ellis5/¶78 {H3/22/14}.  253  See the structure chart sent by Novikov to D1 via WhatsApp on 30.7.17 {K5-B12/61}. \nAA2/1/138\n 133 those D1-2 admittedly owned.254 Clearly D1 was able to determine the fate of those assets, despite their purported ownership by the Kipermans. (3) D3-8 have offered no explanation for Mykhaylo’s supposed disposal of his interest in D8 on 30.3.14 to Trykulych (a PBC employee and oral nominee for D1-2). There are no documents evidencing a sale of this asset for value, or negotiations in respect of such a sale. It is implausible to suppose that this represented a genuine sale; rather, it amounted to a transfer from one D1-2 nominee to another.  (4) D7’s nominee director filed evidence on 2.3.18 stating that D7 had complied with the asset disclosure orders “by seeking information from its ultimate beneficial owners, who are in the Ukraine”: Konnaris2/¶5 {H4/16/2}. Again, the use of the plural is inconsistent with the later assertion that D7 has just one beneficial owner, Mykhaylo Kiperman. (b) The months after service of the WFO 326 On 5.3.18, Sofocleous sent invoices in the amount of €29,750 to each of D3 and D5 {E17/242.6} {E17/242.7}, relating to services provided for the period 20.12.17 to 21.2.18 (i.e. the two months immediately following service of the WFO). Importantly, the invoices show that Sofocleous was billing D3 and D5 for services that it was actually providing to D1. The following excerpts from the invoices are highly revealing: “Attending three meetings in our [Cypriot] offices with AS [Sofocleous], TP, AK and MV with AK, TN [Novikov] and AD.” “Attending meeting in Geneva with AS [Sofocleous], TP and IK [Igor Kolomoisky]” “Attending meeting with AS [Sofocleous], TP and MV in our offices with the other service providers” “Changing the records of 167 companies” Sofocleous invoices to D3 and D5 dated 5.3.18 327 Why was Sofocleous attending a meeting with D1 in Geneva that was billed to D3 and D5 (or, for that matter, three meetings with Novikov)? The obvious inference (absent any explanation from D1), is that D1 was giving instructions in relation to D3 and D5’s conduct of the litigation. And why was Sofocleous meeting with the “other service providers” and “changing the records of 167 companies” and billing these services to D3 and D5? Because D3 and D5 are just part of a stable of D1-2 companies who, with the assistance of compliant CSPs, do whatever it is that D1-2 want. The Bank asked D1 on 10.3.23 to provide further  254  Two examples: (i) Petrol Station at Cherkassy, Odesskaya St, 3 (Tranche 23.5, V K Amarant LLC {A2/29/4}, and {K5-B15/3/1} (row 51); and (ii) Petrol Station at Kherson Region, Kherson, Poltavskaya St, 96 (Tranche 17.3, Front Light Media {A2/31.6/3} and {K5-B15/3/1} (row 45). \nAA2/1/139\n 134 information and disclosure to explain the background to these invoices {L/149/5} (¶¶2.15-2.18); he ignored the request.

Two points arise. First, in the only available judgment, Mann J observed that “it is not wholly clear why [D1] is a party to this action since he does not seem to claim any relief” {I3/2/6} [16]. When one understands D1’s asset holding structures, the reason emerges: had the action gone further, it would have become obvious that Cheklanov was a nominee for (at least) D1. Second, the assets supposedly owned by D3 at the time of the proceedings appear to have ended up in D1-2’s ownership.256 (d) D1-2’s 2008 Asset List 329 D2 has disclosed three asset lists relating to D1-2’s assets in 2008. One such list identifies D1-2 as holding interests in five companies (all in the agricultural sector) via D5: {E1/29P}. See e.g. the following entry, which records that D1-2 held an 94.18% interest in Botievo Grain Receiving Station, of which 32.29% was held through D5 {E1/29P/3}:257  \n 330 D2’s 2008 asset list identifies the director of D5 as “A. Marangos (P)” and the “intermediate beneficial owner” as “S. Leonov (P)”; his 2007 asset list explains that “P” is used to indicate an individual or entity in the “Privat Group” ({E1/11P/1}, tab ‘Introduction’).  255  See Shahar v Tsitsekkos [2004] EWHC 2659 (Ch) {I3/2/1}. 256  D1 has disclosed an interest in TDV TSUM (D1 U/R Asset 134 {J2/8}, D2 U/R Asset 146 {J4/5/153}) which the Bank understands to be the same asset ‘ZUM’ referred to at [7] in Shahar {I3/2/4}. 257  Note columns containing information on the authority of account holders and other information have been excluded so as to accommodate the extract on the page. \nAA2/1/140\n 135 (2) Control of D3-8 via the Bank, Primecap and PBC 331 The role played by Primecap and PBC in directing the affairs of D3-8 at the behest of D1-2 has been set out above. As explained there, D3-8 participated in the Misappropriation and were managed by Primecap and PBC in an identical fashion: in particular, at the instigation of Primecap’s employees, D3-D8 (i) executed the RSAs, RSA Pledges and LFSAs and (ii) participated in the collusive 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings. It is inherently improbable to suppose that D3-8 were under separate ownership or control in circumstances in which their affairs were conducted in such uniform fashion. The only logical explanation is that they were all owned and controlled by D1-2.  (3) D1-2’s involvement in legal proceedings concerning D3-8 (a) The 2016 Arrest Orders 332 On 29.7.16 the Perchesky District Court granted injunctions on the application of the GPO by which it arrested (or froze) the Cyprus branch accounts of D4 and D6-8. On 9.8.16 D1 received a WhatsApp message from Granovsky258 which stated: “Do urgently prepare lawsuits for Privat freezing orders to be revoked. 4 accounts and 1 pending” {K5-A1/24/7}. Granovsky then sent D1 three pages of a court document relating to the GPO’s investigation into prepayments made under “dubious contracts” to D3-8. The document also explained that the GPO had applied for a further arrest order against D3. 333 Granovksy was alerting D1 to the fact that D4 and D6-8’s accounts had been frozen, and a freeze of D3’s accounts was on the way, because he knew that D1 would be highly interested in this information; and would want to “prepare lawsuits to revoke [the] arrests” and be in a position to procure that this was done. Note that D1 does not respond: ‘what are you talking about?’, ‘why would I be interested in these entities?’ or simila"}

Note that D1 does not respond: ‘what are you talking about?’, ‘why would I be interested in these entities?’ or similar {K5-A1/24/8}. 334 The lawsuits proposed by Granovsky were promptly instituted in early September 2016, with the Perchesky Court granting orders unfreezing the relevant Defendants’ accounts between 9.9.16 and 13.9.16.259  (b) The Defamation Proceedings 335 In October to December 2017, D3-5 instituted proceedings in Ukraine purportedly to protect their “business reputation” (the “Defamation Proceedings”). The true purpose of  258  As explained in ¶146 above, Granovsky was a mole used by D1 to seek to obtain privileged information from within the highest echelons of the Bank about the decision to institute these proceedings. 259  {E15/229.1/1} / {E15/234/1} (D7, 9.9.16); {E15/212.01/8} (D8, 13.9.16); {E15/278.1/4} (D6, 13.9.16); {E15/212.02/1} (D4, 16.9.16). \nAA2/1/141\n 136 those proceedings was to generate an artificial lis alibi pendens defence to any claim that might be commenced against D3-5 in England (to which D1-2 would be co-defendants).260 Those proceedings were instituted by D3-5 at D1-2’s instigation. The Bank relies on the following.  336 First, the timing of those proceedings indicates that they were brought when D1-2 were aware that proceedings were likely to be commenced against them in London and they were taking steps to prevent that from happening (it is worth recalling in this regard that information from within the Bank was leaked to D1 in this period concerning the Bank’s preparation of a claim against him): Date Event Reference 14.6.17 Alleged meeting between D1 and President Poroshenko at which D1 was told that a claim would be brought against him in London and “I will freeze your assets”. D2 is “aware” of the meeting.  {L/1/1} {L/2/1} September 2017 D2 puts pressure on his wife (from whom he is separated) to “leave the UK, to avoid any further risk of a jurisdictional link in litigation against him in England” and paid her c. £7m to do so; D2 says that he was making this request because he was “under pressure from his business partners”. {I3/60/9} (¶54) 6.10.17 Publication of Part 1 of an article in the ‘Law and Business’ magazine, alleging that the majority of the loans made by the Bank were to shell companies associated with D1-2 with inadequate security. {I1/1/1} 24.10.17 Publication of Part 2 of the article in ‘Law and Business’ magazine, naming 43 of the Borrowers and D3-8, and referring to the prepayments for goods that were not delivered as part of the fraud at the Bank. {I1/1/9} 27.10.17 D3-5 file claims with the Perchesky District Court to defend their “business reputation”. {I1/2} {I1/3} {I1/4}  1.11.17 D1 files his own claim in the Perchesky District Court to defend his “business reputation” (the “D1 Defamation Claim”). The defendants were ‘Law and Business’ magazine, the journalist, the Bank and the NBU. D1 joined 43 of the Borrowers, D3-8 and D2 as third parties to the claim.  D1 admitted in evidence that the D1 Defamation Claim was commenced “in order to seise the Ukrainian courts of these issues”: {H2/8/65} {I1/8/1-72} 6.11.17 D2 submits a ‘Notice of Claim’ to the Ukrainian government, advancing a case under the UK-Ukraine Bilateral investment treaty in relation to the ‘expropriation’ of his interest in the Bank.

The Court of Appeal reversed that decision (a stay was “entirely inappropriate” {A5/12/52} at [211]). \nAA2/1/142\n 137 6.12.17 Skadden letter to Hogan Lovells echoing Fieldfisher’s letter of 1.12.17. {L/2} 8.12.17 D3-5 file independent claims against the Bank within D1’s defamation claim alleging that the Bank “should have reacted to dissipation of untrue information and should have disputed those statements, but … did not”. {I1/10}, {I1/11}, {I1/12}  337 Second, the Defamation Proceedings have not been pursued by D3-5 or D1 with any urgency after the English Court of Appeal decision. Their claims were split into separate proceedings in 2018 (although D1 remains an interested third party in D3-5’s claims and vice versa). At hearings in October 2022, January 2023, February 2023 and March 2023, D1 and D3-5 requested adjournments or failed to appear, further delaying the proceedings.  338 Third, and standing back, it is absurd to suppose that D3-5 had any “business reputation” in Ukraine to defend: (i) they had already been the subject of Ukrainian court judgments holding them liable for US$1.8bn; (ii) D3-5 took no steps to protect their reputation in the aftermath of the NashiGroshi articles in February 2015 {E7/276.1/1} {E7/276.2/3}; and (iii) D3-5’s own evidence is that they “do not currently engage in any active business trading”: McNeill12/¶2.5.1 {H4/30/3}. 339 Fourth, despite a specific disclosure order being made {A6/93/2} (¶2(c)), there is no evidence or documentary support to suggest that the ‘Law and Business’ magazine article was read by or circulated to any of D3-5’s directors, shareholders or purported beneficial owners in the period between 24.10.17 (when it was published) and 27.10.17 (when they filed their first statements of claim).  340 Finally, as set out above, D3-5 were willing to engage in artificial court proceedings in 2014 to procure the 2014 Ukrainian Judgments, and did so at the direction of PBC and Primecap (ultimately acting on D1-2’s instructions).  (c) The GPO Claims 341 On 25.11.17 D1 was photographed having coffee with the head of the General Prosecutor’s Office (the “GPO”, Yury Lutsenko) in Amsterdam {H1/16.1/2}. Two weeks later, the GPO filed claims, in the name of the Bank, against five of the New Borrowers (Like City, Business Prom Innovatsiya, Borand Trade, Dream-Company and Khromia)261 seeking termination of the New Loans and repayment of the outstanding sums to the Bank. Importantly, the GPO named D3-5 as third parties to the proceedings (the “GPO  261  The selection of these particular five New Borrowers was no coincidence. As reflected in D1Def/Sch. 3 {A1/13} and Sch. 3A {A1/14}, the majority of the New Borrowers’ direct ‘repayments’ of Relevant or Intermediary Loans were made by these particular five New Borrowers. \nAA2/1/143\n 138 Claims”).262  342 Mr Beketov explains in evidence that (i) the GPO did not have authority to bring proceedings in the name of the Bank and (ii) there was no proper basis for D3-5 to be joined as parties, because their rights were not affected by the relief sought in the GPO Claims: Beketov8/¶¶505-507 {C1/1/169}.

That evidence is not disputed. The Court should infer that individuals within the GPO were suborned by D1 to issue the GPO Claims so as to create a further lis alibi pendens argument in England. D3-5 did indeed rely on the GPO Claims in their jurisdiction challenge: McNeill2/¶4.2.2 {H4/12/6}. 343 D1’s ability to influence affairs at the GPO is further evidenced by the fact that a draft letter for international mutual legal assistance from the GPO to HMRC in respect of D3-5 was leaked to him in 2018 via WhatsApp by an individual saved to D1’s phone as “Mini Me” {K5-A1/56/3}.263 The draft MLA request sent to D1 had a filename starting with the words “secret file”: ibid. (top entry) and {K5-B16/10}. (4) D1-2 funding D3-8’s participation in these proceedings 344 D3-8 have given notice under the WFO of c. £11.1m in payments for legal fees. As the Court observed when it adjourned the trial, the evidence as to D3-8’s funding is “opaque and I remain concerned that the full picture has not been disclosed” and “the corporate defendants’ funding tap is turned off and on according to the views of those behind them as to their own personal interests” {A5/19/22} (¶96). The evidence is now overwhelming that D1-2 have been paying D3-8’s legal fees. 345 First, there is no good commercial reason for D3-8 to spend millions defending this claim. D3-5 have disclosed no assets of any value; D6-8 have disclosed receivables which (they say) are only realisable by way of assignment/set-off; and on their own evidence “there is no practical benefit to suing [D3-5], either in terms of their assets, [or] claims that they can make to assets…”: McNeill2/¶13.1.4 {H4/12/23}. Absurdly, D3-8 spent c. £2m on the jurisdiction challenges, yet D3 was subject to compulsory dissolution in February 2019 {E17/258.4.1} (while the appeal was pending) and was only restored to the register in August 2019 {E17/276.3}. 346 Second, D3-5’s legal fees have purportedly been funded by interest free, unsecured loans from Melnyk (c. £1.3m), Yesipova (£22,000) and other purported beneficial owners. As set out above, these individuals are nominees for D1-2. There is no evidence that they had the  262  {I1/61/1-10}, {I1/70/1-18}, {I1/73/1-20}, {I1/76/1}, {I1/79/1}. 263  “Mini Me” was later identified as Artem Solonyk. \nAA2/1/144\n 139 means to fund D3-8’s legal fees in these amounts. 347 Third, D3-5’s legal fees have latterly been funded by Emmet Group (c. £3m). Plainly Emmet Group is not the ultimate source of this funding – it is described as a “nominee shareholder” of D3-5. Nobody has explained where it ultimately acquired these funds. D3’s accounts for the year ended 31.3.22 state that, although Emmet Group is D3’s “immediate and ultimate parent undertaking”, its “ultimate controlling party is unknown”: {E18/25.1/6} (¶8). The Court should infer the money came from D1-2.  348 Fourth, following the Court of Appeal’s decision, D3-8 were ordered to repay £1.5m to the Bank by 12.11.19. On 11.11.19 – the day before the deadline – D3-8 made an application for an extension of time to repay c. half of the £1.5m. In doing so, D3-8 stated that the funds would come from “interest-free unsecured loans by the UBOs to the Corporate Defendants”; they believed “it will take significantly more time to source the circa £760,000 balance” and the “current expectation” was that they would discharge this sum by 31.1.20: McNeill2/¶3.4 {H4/28/3}. In response, the Bank explained that it required further information and that D3-8 would need to "}

In response, the Bank explained that it required further information and that D3-8 would need to disclose the loan agreements with their purported beneficial owners.264 The Bank’s letter prompted a rapid volte face: on 13.11.19, D3-D8 made payment in full. D3-8 have never explained where that money came from.265  349 Fifth, D6-8’s legal fees were also part-funded by unsecured loans from two Cypriot companies, Sanderlyn and Versala, between 22.3.18 and 21.8.20 (c. £1.5m). Those companies are ultimately owned and controlled by D1-2:  (1) The sole shareholder of Sanderlyn is Eftychia Xonofontos, who holds six assets for D1266 and five assets for D2.267 The sole shareholder of Versala is Margarita Papanikolau, who holds D1’s interest in Helenium268 and four assets for D2.269 Sanderlyn’s company secretary is Martineus Secretarial Services, of which Tsitsekkos  264  Hogan Lovells (11.11.19) {L/9}. 265  It is now clear that it came from Kiperman (no doubt on instructions from D1-2). On 2.12.19, Melnyk emailed Kiperman attaching three loan agreements, in a combined sum of c. £800,000, “signed by three English companies under which you have provided a loan and paid legal costs in the total amount of £809,934. I ask you to sign the attached contracts on your part …” {E17/280.1}. The only plausible reason for Kiperman to fund D3-5’s legal fees in this way (and not tell the Bank’s lawyers about it, in breach of the WFO which requires them to inform the Bank where any money spent on legal fees is to come from) is that he was acting as a proxy for D1-2, who owned all of D3-8. 266  Combined value: US$68m: see D1 U/R Asset 49 {J2/3/57} D1 U/R Addendum 14.2.18 (asset 123) {J2/5/9}; D1 U/R update 13.7.18 (asset 70) {J2/7/5}; D1 Asset Disclosure {J1/3/11}; D1 non-UR update 14.2.18 (p.2) {J1/4/2}.  267  Combined value of c. US$34m. See D2 U/R Assets 79, 81, 109, 112 and 120 {J4/5/98}. 268  Value: US$8.7m {J1/3/2}. 269  Combined value of c. US$30m. See D2 U/R Assets 61, 100, 101 and  109 {J4/5/57}.  \nAA2/1/145\n 140 (¶98 above) is the sole shareholder. (2) D1 has disclosed WhatsApp chains between him and Markova for the periods 16.1.18-15.1.19 and 23.5.19-12.9.19.270 In these exchanges, Markova provided D1 with Sanderlyn and Versala’s bank balances (alongside the bank balances of D1-2 companies, D2’s companies and D2’s personal accounts: see ¶137ff above).   (3) Ms Markova also sought and received D1’s consent for payments by Sanderlyn and Versala. For example:  Markova “Equiv [redacted] dollars Sanderlyn (Eurobank) for JV Port and Syntez Issued: Misha [redacted] dollars Sanderlyn (Eurobank) for Odessa Port Issued: Misha” D1 “All good” D1 WhatsApp exchange with Markova on 31.5.19 {K5-A1/40/6}  Markova “As of 25/06 [redacted] euro from Versala (RIB) to Versala (PNB) credit to account. Funds to then be transferred to Proteas escrow agent for purchase of debts of a number of companies from Cyprus legal services provider” D1 “OK” D1 WhatsApp exchange with Markova on 21.6.19 {K5-A1/40/18} (4) It is important to note that (i) when these WhatsApp chains were first disclosed by D1 the references to Sanderlyn and Versala had all been redacted; and (ii) Sanderlyn and Versala have not made any payments in respect of D6-8’s legal fees since the unredacted messages were disclosed. (5) Finally, there is no commercial reason for Sanderlyn and Versala to fund D6-8’s defence in this way. They are not litigation funders by trade: Versala’s main business activities are said to include “investing with holding of investments in the ferroalloy, mining and processing and meta"}

They are not litigation funders by trade: Versala’s main business activities are said to include “investing with holding of investments in the ferroalloy, mining and processing and metal branches” {H1/73.01}, while Sanderlyn involves itself with “trading with oil and oil products” {E4/341.1}. 350 Sixth, these points have already caused the Court to find prima facie that D1-2 have been funding D3-8’s legal fees {A5/22/8} (¶22).  G3 The Alleged Principals 351 The Bank’s case is that D1-2 owned and controlled the Alleged Principals: (i) they were held through D1-2’s admitted nominees; (ii) D1-2 have long-standing connections with the  270  {K5-A1/39}, {K5-A1/40}.  \nAA2/1/146\n 141 Alleged Principals; and (iii) they were controlled via Primecap. 352 D3-8 identified the following directors, nominee shareholders and purported beneficial owners of the Alleged Principals:  Alleged Principal Directors Nominee Shareholders UBOs Hangli (D3) Elias Kyriakides Elias Kyriakides Pivovar, for Trykulych. Brimmilton (D4) Stella Chatzikosti Stella Chatzikosti Jan 13 – Feb 16 Andriy Kolobkov Feb 16 – Dec 16 Iuliia Lykhachova Collard (D5) Soterakis Theocharides Soterakis Theocharides  Ryazantseva 353 As to those purported beneficial owners:  (1) Trykulych is addressed at ¶323 above. The fact that she was simultaneously a purported beneficial owner of D3 (and therefore one of the “persons with the power to control” it) and its Alleged Principal scuppers D3-5’s pleaded case that: “the English Defendants have no knowledge as to whether their Principals effected supply of the goods or returned prepayments under the Agency Supply Agreements and do not admit that they did not” {A1/20/8} (¶17(6)). (2) Kolobov is a PBC employee who sat on the board of eight D1-2 companies and was a purported beneficial owner of 18 Borrowers and 8 Intermediary Borrowers: {K4-A/15}. He was removed from the supervisory board of D1-2 companies following the Luchaninov Email and removed and replaced as the beneficial owner of two offshore companies following the Rokoman Email.  (3) Ryazantseva is a PBC employee who holds assets for D1 pursuant to oral agreements; sat on the boards of D1-2 companies; and was a purported beneficial owner of 5 Borrowers and 5 Intermediary Borrowers {K4-A/26}. (4) Lykhachova is a PBC employee who holds interests in two assets for D1271 and two assets for D2272 pursuant to oral agreements; and she was removed as a director of Well Rise LLC following the Luchaninov Email.  354 There are many further links between D1-2 and the Alleged Principals. Taking Brimmilton as an example: (i) it appears in D2’s 2007 asset list in the holding structure for D1-2’s interest  271  D1 U/R Asset 52 {J2/3/66} and 70 {J2/7/5}. 272  D2 U/R Assets 67 and 109 {J4/5/68}. \nAA2/1/147\n 142 in NZF {E1/11P/18} (tab ‘NZF’) – it even has (P) after its name, to show it is a member of the “Privat group”; (ii) it holds a 12.24% interest in PJSC Chornomorsk Fuel Terminal for D1-2;273 (iii) it was administered and controlled on a day-to-day basis by Primecap.274 Indeed, the signatory of the Alleged Agency Agreement for Brimmilton was Oleksandr Pustovoy, a ‘Senior Manager’ at Primecap {A1/22/7}, {K3-B/509.1L/2}; (iv) in 2011, Anischenko reported to D2 on US$245m transferred by Grizal (used by D2 as a de facto ‘piggy-bank’) to Brimmilton, along with interest earned on Brimmilton’s deposit {E1/103}, and in 2016 Markova messaged Anishchenko about payments by “Brimm[ilton]” {K5-A3/10/2}; and (v) D1 was able to obtain 5,318 pages of Brimmilton’s bank statements for the purpose of his jurisdiction challenge in 2018. G4 Summary 355 Five key themes appear from the detailed points made "}
{"start": 399000, "text": "1/22/7}, {K3-B/509.1L/2}; (iv) in 2011, Anischenko reported to D2 on US$245m transferred by Grizal (used by D2 as a de facto ‘piggy-bank’) to Brimmilton, along with interest earned on Brimmilton’s deposit {E1/103}, and in 2016 Markova messaged Anishchenko about payments by “Brimm[ilton]” {K5-A3/10/2}; and (v) D1 was able to obtain 5,318 pages of Brimmilton’s bank statements for the purpose of his jurisdiction challenge in 2018. G4 Summary 355 Five key themes appear from the detailed points made above.  356 First, the Structure and Nominee Charts show how the same companies and nominees are used time and again to hold the Borrowers, Intermediary Borrowers, D3-8 and their alleged Principals. The individuals are largely PBC and former Bank employees who can be linked to D1-2 in a variety of other ways: for example, they hold valuable assets – often running to tens or even hundreds of millions of US$ – for D1-2 under oral agreements (or arrangements arising through “conduct and implication”); they hold senior executive and management positions within D1-2’s corporate empire; and the companies holding the Borrowers etc. often appear in the structures holding D1-2’s admitted assets. 357 Second, during 2015, there was a concerted effort to conceal D1-2’s connections with many of the Borrowers. It went on within D1-2’s own Bank and was implemented by D1-2’s own lieutenants, most importantly Yatsenko, Gurieva and Novikov. The complex process of removing those links to fool the NBU involved mass changes of company directorships and purported beneficial ownership (e.g. the Luchaninov Email and the Updated Rokoman Spreadsheet), the use of a cypher to conceal the identities of purported UBOs (the Beneficiary Key), and the taking of dubious legal advice from Avellum (e.g. to consider the acquisition of 100 companies “by one or several beneficiaries on the same day”).  358 Third, the Borrowers were all treated alike – they had the same kind of loans granted after  273  D1 U/R Asset 52 {J2/3/66}; D2 U/R Asset 67 {J4/5/68}. See too the draft beneficiary instructions to be given by D2 in respect of Brimmilton’s shareholding in PJSC Chornomorsk Fuel Terminal: {E17/245.2}. 274  See e.g. {E14/341} (an unsigned Brimmilton – Primecap services agreement); {E2/217}{E2/218} (Dolmatov email to SK law with draft agreement for Celastrina to purchase shares in Dniproazot from Brimmilton); {E2/219}, {E2/220} agreement returned by SK Law signed by Brimmilton.  \nAA2/1/148\n 143 the same type of desultory approval process, near identical RSAs, the same involvement in the Ukrainian Proceedings, and so on. Indeed, as set out in Section H below, the borrowing of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers was purportedly discharged in the same three ways. It is just not realistic to suggest that these companies were in separate beneficial ownership.  359 Fourth, D1-2 have been forced to admit majority interests in four Borrowers (Alfatrader, Uniks, Dorteks and Prado). So why did these four companies borrow US$99m + UAH1.6bn from the Bank in the same way as all the other Borrowers if the other Borrowers were not also owned by D1-2? And why did they make Unreturned Prepayments in the same way as all the other Borrowers? D1 and D2’s refusal to attend for cross-examination shows that they are unable to answer. 360 Fifth, D1-2’s case that they do not own D3-8 is in tatters. The purported UBOs of these companies – such as the ubiquitous Melnyk – are all individuals with whom D1-2 have close links. And a damning body of evidence has slowly been extracted from D1-2. It includes (i) D3 and D5 being billed for meetings that D1 and Novikov had with Sofocleous in the two months after the WFO was served. For good measure, D3 and D5 were also billed for work carried out by that same CSP in “changing the records of 167 companies” (which can only be a reference to companies in D1-2’s stable); (ii) D3-5 instituting the Defamation Proceedings for D1-2’s benefit, despite being judgment"}

He suggests that c. UAH 10.9bn and US$1.2bn of Relevant Loans were repaid in this way,277 leaving outstanding balances of c. UAH 4.4bn and US$976m prior to the Asset Transfer; (2) UAH 1.3bn and US$550m of those balances were repaid between March and September 2016 by way of the Asset Transfer, leaving outstanding balances on Relevant Loans of approximately UAH 3.1bn and US$425m; and (3) Those balances were repaid with the proceeds of the New Loans to New Borrowers as part of the Transformation between October and November 2016.278 362 At the outset, it is important to distinguish purported ‘repayment’ of Relevant Loans (i.e. the recording in the Bank’s books of the loans as being repaid) from the issue which really matters in this case, which is whether the loss caused to the Bank by the fraudulent Relevant Drawdowns has been made good. These are different things. It was part of the cover up of the Misappropriation to make it appear in the Bank’s books as if the Relevant Drawdowns had been repaid. But all this involved was procuring further fraudulent lending from the Bank (to the Borrowers, and the Intermediary and New Borrowers) which were then purportedly applied to ‘repay’ the Relevant Loans. That did not make the Bank’s loss good at all but simply covered it up. This point is explained in further detail under Section M below, in relation to the Bank’s loss. 363 In this Section, the Bank describes the key factual features – and plainly illegitimate nature – of each of the purported sources of ‘repayment’ relied upon by D1. The Bank’s case on  275  D1Def/¶¶15 {A1/8/12}, 55C {A1/8/30} and 77(3) {A1/8/43}. D2 advances the same case on repayment: D2Def/¶67(4) {A1/18/32}.  276  ‘Cash’ is a misnomer. No-one is suggesting that any physical cash was used; D1’s case is that the proceeds of loans were used to repay other loans by way of accounting entries in the Bank’s records. 277  D1Def/Sch. 1 {A1/9/5}. The figures are those in column G (‘cash’ repayments before 10.9.14) and column J (‘cash’ repayments after 10.9.14 and before the Asset Transfer). It is not clear why D1 uses 10.9.14 as the end of what he calls the ‘Relevant Period’. 278  D1Def/¶15 {A1/8/12} and Sch. 1-3 {A1/9} {A1/10} {A1/11}. \nAA2/1/150\n 145 causation and loss is set out in Section M below; and issues as to the valuation of the assets that formed the subject of the Asset Transfer are discussed in Section N.

Accordingly, they did not reduce the Bank’s loss arising from the Misappropriation.  364 One preliminary point should be addressed at the outset. On 13.4.23, D2 served a Notice to Prove in respect of certain transaction narratives contained in specific entries in the Bank’s transactional data.279 D2 accepts the authenticity of all the other fields – including those showing the sums constituting the Relevant Drawdowns flowing out to the Borrowers.  This is a baseless and unnecessary distraction:  (1) D2’s notice is served diffidently on the basis that he does not “personally know whether or not the narratives are authentic”. Indeed, D2 has said that he “does not go so far as to positively deny the authenticity of the transactional data, but has merely put the Bank to proof in a limited regard”.280  (2) The transactional data was taken from four separate repositories at the Bank: its ODB archive and Data Warehouse in both Ukraine and Cyprus {A4/14/2}); none of the experts has identified a material discrepancy between the two data sets;281 and, as explained by Maxim Pugach (the Bank’s pre-nationalisation head of IT and a D1 witness whose evidence was adopted by D2: {G2/23/2} (¶4)), the ODB archive in Ukraine (called BalArc) is a ‘read only’ data source: Pugach/¶12.2.1{H2/6/7}.   279  D2 note dated 22.5.23/¶¶8 and 10. 280  The notice is expressly stated to apply to transaction narratives (i) showing the Relevant Drawdowns and the prepayments and returns of prepayment which are linked as part of the Bank’s Methodology to show that the Relevant Drawdowns funded the Unreturned Prepayments: Thompson1/App 3-2-1-1 to App 3-2-46-2 {D1/8}ff; (ii) used by Mr Thompson to identify the ultimate sources of repayment of the Relevant Drawdowns using the Bank’s Methodology: Thompson1/App 4-8-1-1 to App 4-8-47-2 {D1/131}ff; (iii) showing the application of Transferred Assets to reduce the balance on Relevant Loans: Thompson1/App 4-2-1 – 4-2-3 {D1/120}; (iv) showing the drawdown of funds which constitute Intermediary Drawdowns and New Loans: Thompson1/App 4-12 {D1/270P}, App 4-16 {D1/274}; and (v) referred to in Mr Thompson’s application and analysis of the Alternative Methodology (i.e. Funds Flow – in respect of which transaction narratives play no role) to identify the ultimate sources of repayment of Relevant Drawdowns: Thompson1/App 4-10-1 {D1/236P} to App 4-10-27 {D1/262P}; Thompson2/App 5-2-1 to 5-2-6 {D1/414}ff. It also purports to apply to transaction narratives in appendices which don’t exist (Thompson2/App 3-2), and fails to identify certain appendices with proper particularity (Thompson2/Apps 5-1, 5-2, 6-4 are not titles to any appendices in Thompson2,  and e.g. Thompson2/App 5-1-1{D1/406} does not in fact refer to any transaction narratives at all). 281  Thompson1/App 3-3-5 {D1/104/2}. Mr Davidson {D2/5/3} and Mr Steadman {D3/4/2} say that, of 21 million transactions, 23 appear in ODB data which they could not reconcile to the Data Warehouse data, and 3 appear in the Data Warehouse data that they could not match to the ODB data. They do not identify those transactions, but do not appear to consider the discrepancies material. \nAA2/1/151\n 146 (3) It is wholly implausible to suggest that the specific narratives identified by D2 might be inauthentic but the other c.21 million transactions – in respect of which no notice to prove has been served – are authentic.

D2 advances no positive case as to who might have had the motivation and practical ability to amend these narratives. (4) The transaction narratives are confirmed by a plethora of contemporaneous materials, the authenticity of which D2 is deemed to accept, having served no notice to prove in respect of them. The Supply Agreement references contained in the transaction narratives for each of the 82 Unreturned Prepayments are identical to those found in contemporary SWIFT confirmations: see Schedule 10. The Bank can also show (by reference to a sample of the narratives for the Relevant Drawdowns, prepayments/returns of prepayment, and Intermediary Drawdowns)282 that the transaction narratives match those used in contemporary records including bank statements, Skype conversations, SWIFT confirmations, applications for the purchase of US$, the Kazantsev Spreadsheet and the Gurieva Spreadsheet: see Schedule 10. (5) The Bank’s position is that D2’s Notice to Prove is improper and/or abusive, being inconsistent with D2’s prior conduct in these proceedings: (i) D2 has positively relied upon the transaction narratives, for example when adopting the analysis contained in the Lafferty Spreadsheets for the purposes of his jurisdiction challenge;283 (ii) D2 did not challenge the authenticity of the transaction narratives at any point in the last five years and has permitted all parties and their experts to proceed on the basis that it is authentic throughout; (iii) this quiescence comes despite D2 telling Mann J at the first CMC that “… the Bank’s total transactional database runs to 10 terabytes containing 6.8 billion lines of data. That database will need to be interrogated by the experts” {G2/61/16} (¶44); and (iv) D2’s most recent amendments – to adopt D1’s case on Asset Transfer and on ‘Relevant Drawdown Portions’ – rely on the transaction narratives to attribute particular assets to particular loans and to identify the Relevant Drawdown Portions.284  (6) Lastly the point is also a red herring, so far as the Bank’s claim against D2 is concerned.  The Bank’s case against D1-2 is in tort and does not depend on showing  282  Given that D2 puts the Bank to proof in respect of well over ten thousand narratives, it is impracticable to conduct this exercise on anything other than a sample basis. 283  See, for example, Lafferty 2/¶34.6 {H2/8/9}; exhibit ANL4, p.1 {H2/20.1/1}. For D2’s adoption of D1’s evidence, see {G2/23/2} (¶4). 284  D2Def/¶¶67(5A)-(6) {A1/18/32}.  \nAA2/1/152\n 147 any transactional link between Relevant Drawdowns and Unreturned Prepayments. Its loss is the extraction of its monies through the Relevant Drawdowns285.   H1 The Intermediary Loans 365 As Mr Thompson explains, substantially all of D1’s ‘cash repayments’ of the Relevant Drawdowns originated from “Intermediary Drawdowns”: Thompson1/¶4.19 {D1/1/121}. The Intermediary Drawdowns took the form of (i) drawdowns under Relevant Loans which are not Relevant Drawdowns; (ii) drawdowns under further loans to the Borrowers (i.e. the Intermediary Loans granted to the Borrowers); and (iii) drawdowns under further loan facilities to 34 Ukrainian borrowers (i.e. the Intermediary Loans granted to the Intermediary Borrowers). The Intermediary Borrowers were further shell companies controlled by D1-2 and the Intermediary Loans were further sham loan facilities which exhibit the same or similar (illegitimate) features as the Relevant Loans. Mr Thompson identifies the Intermediary Loans and Intermediary Drawdowns286 in Appendices 4-13 {D1/271P}  and 4-12 {D1/270P} to his first report. The purported ‘repayments’ funded by these Intermediary Drawdowns "}
{"start": 413000, "text": "s (i.e. the Intermediary Loans granted to the Intermediary Borrowers). The Intermediary Borrowers were further shell companies controlled by D1-2 and the Intermediary Loans were further sham loan facilities which exhibit the same or similar (illegitimate) features as the Relevant Loans. Mr Thompson identifies the Intermediary Loans and Intermediary Drawdowns286 in Appendices 4-13 {D1/271P}  and 4-12 {D1/270P} to his first report. The purported ‘repayments’ funded by these Intermediary Drawdowns broadly fall into two categories. 366 First, certain repayments of Relevant Drawdowns were directly funded by the return of a prepayment which had been made on an earlier date (in most cases, c. 90 days earlier) and that earlier prepayment had, in turn, been made using the proceeds of an Intermediary Drawdown. This accounts for approximately 47% in value of ‘cash’ repayments directly funded from Intermediary Drawdowns.287 An example of this is AEF. In that case: (1) On 7.10.13, AEF drew down US$33m and US$12m on two Intermediary Loans. The proceeds of these Intermediary Drawdowns were used by AEF, on the same day, to make a prepayment of US$45m to Kalten Trade under a Supply Agreement with reference ST-01/65 (dated 4.9.13) (the “October Prepayment”). (2) Just under 90 days later, on 27.12.13, AEF made Relevant Drawdowns of US$34m and US$11m. AEF used that money to make a prepayment of US$45m to Kalten Trade under a different Supply Agreement with ref. ST-01/77 (dated 24.12.13); this  285  Indeed it is D1-2 who allege that the loss caused by the Relevant Drawdowns was later reduced, and that is for them to prove. At least in respect of the Asset Transfer, that means relying on the narratives which identify which asset repaid which loan.285  In such circumstances, the only outcome with respect to the case against D2 of a finding that the narratives placed in issue were inauthentic would be to remove the factual basis for D1-2’s case that there should be a reduction by reason of transferred assets. 286  An ‘Intermediary Drawdown’ is a drawdown under an Intermediary Loan which was purportedly used (in whole or in part) to repay a Relevant Drawdown. Accordingly, where multiple drawdowns were made on an Intermediary Loan, it excludes those drawdowns which were used for other purposes. 287  That is, US$517m of US$1.098bn. \nAA2/1/153\n 148 drawdown ultimately funded an Unreturned Prepayment. (3) On the same day,288 but after the Relevant Drawdowns had been disbursed, AEF received from Kalten Trade a return of the October Prepayment. AEF then used this return of the October Prepayment to ‘repay’ the Relevant Drawdowns made earlier in the day. In this way, the return of an earlier prepayment (funded from an Intermediary Drawdown) funded the ‘repayment’ of Relevant Drawdowns.  367 Second, and representing the other c. 53% in value, many Relevant Drawdowns were purportedly repaid using further illegitimate loans which were drawn down after the Relevant Drawdowns. Here, because the prepayment scheme had stopped with the Unreturned Prepayments, the proceeds of the further illegitimate borrowing were laundered from the Intermediary Borrower to the Borrower through some means other than a prepayment/return of prepayment. An example of this is Foxar: (1) Foxar made Relevant Drawdowns on 1.4.14 and 2.4.14 in the UAH equivalent of US$35.3m. Foxar used that money to make a prepayment of US$35.3m to Spircom Investments under a Supply Agreement with reference K1503 (dated 15.3.14). (2) Subsequently, on 25.12.14, Vikor M drew down UAH 499m under two Intermediary Loans and transferred this sum289 to Foxar purportedly as a “payment for simple named shares under the agreement no. 1042-BV dated 19.12.2014”. On the same day, Foxar used part of this sum to repay the Relevant Drawdowns at (1) above. 368 All Intermediary Loans represented further illegitimate sham lending, which was intended simply to keep the wheels of the fraud turning.290 The features of the Interm"}

(2) Subsequently, on 25.12.14, Vikor M drew down UAH 499m under two Intermediary Loans and transferred this sum289 to Foxar purportedly as a “payment for simple named shares under the agreement no. 1042-BV dated 19.12.2014”. On the same day, Foxar used part of this sum to repay the Relevant Drawdowns at (1) above. 368 All Intermediary Loans represented further illegitimate sham lending, which was intended simply to keep the wheels of the fraud turning.290 The features of the Intermediary Loans which render them manifestly improper are similar to those identified above for the Relevant Loans and are summarised in the relevant SOFs: {F1/2} to {F1/51} (Borrowers, where applicable); and {F1/52} to {F1/85} (Intermediary Borrowers). In particular: (i) the Intermediary Borrowers were self-evidently unsuitable borrowers, which had no prospect of repaying the (very significant) sums borrowed from any genuine business activity; (ii) the Intermediary Loans were made without any proper process or scrutiny; (iii) the security for the Intermediary Loans was non-existent or manifestly inadequate; (iv) the Intermediary  288  The return of the earlier prepayment (and repayment of the Relevant Drawdown) was not always on the same day as the Relevant Drawdown was made. For example, AEF made a Relevant Drawdown of UAH 203.9m on 24.3.14, which was repaid using the return of a prepayment under a previous supply agreement on 31.3.14 (i.e. seven days later). 289  Together with UAH 55.9m it received from another source. 290  POC/¶62(1) {A1/2/34}, Reply/¶27 {A1/25/35}; Bank RRFI/¶36 {A2/4/34}; Bank RRFI/¶18 {A2/9/17}. \nAA2/1/154\n 149 Loans were not used for any legitimate purpose or for the purpose stated on the loan applications, but were instead always intended to be used solely to make it appear as though other loans were being serviced and repaid; (v) the Intermediary Loans were not on market terms, particularly as regards interest;291 and (vi) the repayment of capital on the Intermediary Loans was frequently deferred, and there were even more frequent amendments of the interest payment terms (often, but not exclusively, accompanying deferral of capital repayment). 369 The evidence also demonstrates that the Intermediary Borrowers were ultimately owned and/or controlled by D1-2,292 and that D1-2 caused the Bank to engage in (illegitimate) lending to them:293 see Section G above.  H2 The Restructuring and Asset Transfer 370 In overview, the Asset Transfer involved the following:  (1) Between March and September 2016 some 40 companies (the “Transferors”) entered into mortgage agreements (the “Mortgages”) with the Bank by which they pledged a total of 387 assets to the Bank as collateral for the Relevant Loans, Intermediary Loans and other loans. Each Mortgage purported to record the value of the asset(s) pledged to the Bank (the “Credit Value”), which values were purportedly based on valuation reports provided to the Bank at or about the same time (the “2016 Valuation Reports”). (2) Within days of a Mortgage being entered into, entries were made in the Bank’s books to record that the assets pledged under the Mortgage had been transferred (or purportedly transferred) to the Bank (i.e. the Bank purportedly enforced its rights under the Mortgage). The Credit Value of the asset was then debited in the Bank’s accounts against the outstanding balances on the Relevant Loans, Intermediary Loans and/or other loans.294 Where an asset was used to repay all or part of Relevant Loan(s), it is referred to as a ‘Relevant Loan Transferred Asset’ (“RLTA”); where it was used to repay all or part of Intermediary Loan(s) it is referred to as an ‘Intermediary Loan Transferred Asset’ (“ILTA”). Of the total of 387 assets, 336  291  Bank RRFI/¶4(b)(ii) {A2/16/5}. 292  POC/¶62(1) {A1/2/34}, Reply/¶27 {A1/25/35}; Bank RRFI/¶36 {A2/4/34}; Bank RRFI/¶18 {A2/9/17}. 293  POC/¶52(1)(vi.A) {A1/2/30}. 294  With the exception of the Aircraft, the Credit Values of the Tr"}

Where those assets were applied to reduce the value of US$ loans, the Credit Value of the asset was converted from UAH to US$ using the FX rate on the date the asset was transferred to the Bank. See D1 RRFI/8 and fn 2 {A2/27/3}.  \nAA2/1/155\n 150 were RLTAs and/or ILTAs. (3) The 336 RLTAs and ILTAs consisted of 246 petrol stations (the “Petrol Stations”), 74 oil storage facilities (the “OSFs”), nine aircraft (the “Aircraft”) and seven items of real estate (the “Real Estate”). The entries in the Bank’s books to account for these assets were made in tranches on 31 non-consecutive days between March and September 2016.295 In the simplest tranches, one asset was used to reduce the balance of one loan in the Bank’s books. In other tranches, one asset was used to reduce the balance on many loans or many assets transferred on the same day were used to reduce the balance of many loans in the Bank’s books. (4) According to the Bank’s transactional data, the RLTAs and ILTAs had total Credit Values of US$163m and UAH 17.2bn.296 Those assets were purportedly applied to reduce Relevant Loan balances of US$538m and UAH 1.29bn and Intermediary Loan balances of US$123m and UAH 1.27bn.297 371 In the following paragraphs, the Bank summarises (i) the chronology of the Asset Transfer; and (ii) D1-2’s involvement in it. (1) Chronology of the Asset Transfer  372 As set out in Section B above, it was clear by late 2015 that the Bank would require significant recapitalisation:298 (1) On 11.12.15, the NBU published its Final Report299 following the 2015 stress tests: it concluded that the Bank required additional capital of UAH 113bn to comply with its capital adequacy ratio.300 (2) On 14.1.16, the NBU passed Resolution 8/BT which approved the Final Report and the requirement that the Bank increase its capital by UAH 113bn {E12/175}. (3) Between December 2015 and February 2016, the Bank and the NBU sought to thrash out the terms of a restructuring plan which complied with the NBU’s  295  See D1 RRFI/Annex A (amended) {A2/28/1-133} and Reply/¶¶27G.1-27G.2 {A1/25/43}.   296  Thompson3/App 5-3-3-3, Table B (cells Q430, R430, Y430) {D1/458P}.  297  D1Def/¶41(7)-(8) {A1/8/24}; Thompson1/¶¶4.35-4.44. {D1/1/125-126}. 298  Rozhkova1/¶144 {B1/5/35}; On 18.9.15, Gontareva (NBU) said to D1: “Dubilet and I are actively working, but the amounts are huge, you need to know and prepare a plan. The plan should be calculated for 3 years for inside [sc. related party lending] and 4 years for capital. The figures are massive, we need a realistic plan. Everything should be approved by the New Year” {K5-A1/22/2}. 299  {E12/103.1}; Rozhkova1/¶129 {B1/5/31}. 300  {E12/108}; Rozhkova1/¶146 {B1/5/35}.

Four days later, D1 signed a further version of his letter by which he gave an additional assurance that UAH 1.29bn of related party lending would be repaid on a monthly basis between March 2016 and December 2020 {E12/255}{E12/256}. 374 On 10.2.16, the NBU wrote again to the Bank to note that the draft restructuring plan “should be refined due to the unacceptability of a range of suggested actions and the inconsistency of the submitted plan’s format with the requirements set for all banks” {E12/271}. Around the same time, Gontareva told D1 during a phone call between them that, unless the Bank provided a satisfactory plan, the NBU would have no choice but to declare the Bank insolvent.304 375 On 12.2.16, the Bank’s Supervisory Board (including D1-2) approved the “Restructuring Plan” {E12/282} {E12/283}, pursuant to which (inter alia) the Bank was to increase its regulatory capital by UAH 113bn by (i) taking 169 assets onto its balance sheet with a value of UAH 31bn, including 149 OSFs and further items of real estate; and (ii) taking mortgages of a further 275 assets with a value of UAH 76bn.  376 On 23.2.16, the NBU approved the Restructuring Plan by Resolution 103/BT subject to, amongst other things,“verification of its fair value by the [NBU] and submission by [the Bank] of this property sales schedule…” {E15/303} (“Resolution 103”). It further provided that, in the event the measures set out in the Restructuring Plan were insufficient to increase the Bank’s regulatory capital by UAH 113bn, “the owners of [the Bank were] to be obliged to provide additional collateral and/or undertake actions to increase the bank’s capital within one month ….”. The resolution also imposed a ban on further lending to clients “with [a] non-transparent ownership structure”.   301  See Rozhkova1/¶¶151-158 {B1/5/37-8}. 302  The Bank proposed to use the proceeds of D1-2’s Energy Charter Treaty claims against the Ukrainian State: {E12/138/2}. The NBU unsurprisingly rejected this proposal: {E12/152/1-3}. 303  See Rozkova1/¶¶151-158 and 181 {B1/5/37-8}; {E12/252.1}.  304  Rozhkova1/¶157 {B1/5/38}.

US$1.15bn) in assets onto its balance sheet. That did not happen. By 1.4.16, the Bank had only taken 85 OSFs with a Credit Value of UAH 4.8bn.305 Under pressure from the NBU, between 30.5.16 and 30.6.16, further OSFs and the Real Estate were transferred (or purportedly transferred) to the Bank with a combined Credit Value of c. UAH 20bn. In fact, those Credit Values were wildly inflated: (i) the OSFs were largely not operational but individuals within the Bank provided false information to the third-party valuers to ensure that they were valued as if they were (see ¶605ff below); (ii) (with the exception of the Stadium, on which the experts disagree) the experts agree that the Real Estate was initially overvalued; and (iii) the overvaluation of Hotel Zirka and the Dnipro Office was so egregious that even the Bank (still under D1-2’s control) was forced to adjust their values downwards in its books by UAH 1.9bn and UAH 240m respectively (US$77m and US$9.2m) in August and September 2016.306 378 Throughout "}

The NBU noted that “only 7 of the 33 audited [OSFs] are operational, or 21% (most have not worked for a long period: 5-6 years). They have been overvalued…”  {E14/309.2}. Dubilet reported on the outcome of the meeting to Novikov and Yatsenko the same day {E14/309.1}. 380 On 10.7.16, D1 sent a letter to the NBU acknowledging the Bank’s failure to comply with the Restructuring Plan and giving a “personal guarantee obligation that … From October 2016, repayment of the debt of borrowers connected to the Bank will begin … by the end of August 2016 the Bank will receive in its balance sheet enough of the assets mentioned in Attachment 1, at the market price previously  305  Thompson3/App 5-3-3-3 (column Q) {D1/458P}.  306  D1 RRFI/Annex A {A2/28/43}; Bezant-Assets1/¶6.7 {D19/1/99} ¶¶7.5-7.6 {D19/1/125}; Thompson3/App 5-3-3-3, cells X418, X420, X422 and X424 {D1/458P}.  307  See, for example: {E14/94}; {E14/95P}; {E14/178}; {E14/179P}; {E14/194}.  308  {E14/267}; Rozhkova1/¶173 {B1/5/43}.  309  Rozhkova1/¶¶174, 176 {B1/5/44}.  \nAA2/1/158\n 153 agreed with the NBU, to liquidate the shortfall in capital …” {B4/1/34}. The list contained some of D1-2’s genuinely valuable assets (including, for example, Neftekhimik Prikarpatye Oil Refinery, Borivazh and GM Georgian Manganese Holding); ultimately, however, none of these valuable assets was transferred to the Bank: Rozhkova1/¶183 {B1/5/46}. Notably, the assets listed included ones in which D2 had interests310 and assets of which he was the sole owner;311 plainly, D1 must have been acting with D2’s authority in sending this list to the NBU. 381 From around mid-July 2016, D1 met Rozhkova roughly every two weeks to discuss progress: Rozhkova1/¶180 {B1/5/45}. D1’s close involvement is evident from his messages with Rozhkova: on 16.8.16, he sent her a list of petrol stations to be transferred via WhatsApp and informed her that “if the aforesaid petrol filling stations fail, we will replace them with others”.312 382 By mid-September 2016, the Bank had recorded assets with (adjusted) Credit Values of UAH 30bn and US$163m on its balance sheet.313 As Rozhkova explains, sufficient re-capitalisation across the banking sector (which, for the Bank, meant increasing the size of its balance sheet by at least UAH 31.5bn) was a pre-condition to the release of further funds by the IMF to Ukraine: as such, the NBU and the Bank were under serious pressure in August-September 2016 to complete the Asset Transfer: Rozhkova1/¶182-183 {B1/5/46}. 383 In the same period, the Bank started to enter into lease agreements by which the OSFs and Petrol Stations were let to third parties pursuant to “Finance Leases”.

That had always been envisaged by the NBU (and the IMF): the Bank would retain the assets on its balance sheet, but obtain a cash flow by leasing them out on market terms. The premise of the NBU’s agreement to this course of action {E14/346/2}, however, was that the assets had been correctly valued (which they had not) and would be leased at market rates to lessees of good standing (which they were not): Rozhkova2/¶¶50-56 {B1/18/15}. 384 Thus, by mid-September 2016, the Bank had applied Credit Values of c. UAH 30bn and US$163m to its balance sheet for Transferred Assets purportedly worth that much, and applied those sums purportedly to reduce on its books the outstanding balances on Relevant, Intermediary and other loans. The IMF accordingly disbursed a further tranche of US$1bn to Ukraine. But the Bank had done little to comply with its other obligations under the  310  Including Goiania, Pennylane, Dniproazot and Borivazh.  311  For example, Hotel Split: {B4/1/36} (no. 18).  312  {K5-A1/54/2-3}, attaching {K5-B15/3}.  313  Thompson3/App 5-3-3 (cells 432Q-R) {D1/458P}.  \nAA2/1/159\n 154 Restructuring Plan. Furthermore, it was becoming clear that certain assets had been overvalued: Hotel Zirka and the Dnipro Office were written down following revaluations instigated by the NBU, and Borivazh (a grain terminal supposedly worth c. UAH 2bn) simply ‘disappeared’ from the Bank’s balance sheet.314 (2) D1-2’s involvement in the Asset Transfer 385 D1-2 say that they had limited involvement in the Asset Transfer. D1 makes “[n]o admissions” as to his “responsibility for decisions made by the Bank to accept Relevant Loan Transferred Assets in return for repayment of Relevant Loans or as to the valuation of such assets”.315 D2 pleads only that he was “made aware in general terms” of the Asset Transfer; he denies that he was able to exercise control over (inter alia) the decision to accept RLTAs, at the valuations adopted, as purported repayment of the Relevant Loans.316 386 Thus, although they admit that most of the Transferred Assets were their own assets (see further below), D1-2 claim that they were not involved in the selection of these assets for transfer or the process of the transfer – their position appears to be that they were content for the Bank simply to choose which of their assets to take, without the need to consult them. This is a false case, advanced to support the lie that D1-2 did not control the Bank and that the Asset Transfer was directed by the NBU. In fact, as set out below, D1-2 were closely involved: they ultimately owned and controlled all of the parties involved in the Asset Transfer, and also controlled the process itself. 387 Ownership and control: D1 and D2 accept that they were the UBOs of 50%+ interests in the majority of the Transferred Assets.317 There is only a minority of assets in respect of which D1-2 deny any interest: the Aircraft, the Dnipro Office, 26 of the 74 OSFs318 and 28 of the 246 Petrol Stations.319 However, the evidence and the inherent probabilities demonstrate that D1-2 owned and controlled all of the Transferred Assets:  (1) The purpose of the Asset Transfer was to comply with the Restructuring Plan and  314  See {E16/179/21, 56-57}; Rozhkova1/¶186 {B1/5/47}. 315  D1Def/¶7(2)(a)(v) {A1/8/5}.

This had been expressly admitted by (i) D1 in his letter entitled “Personal Guarantee Undertaking” of 10.7.16,333 and (ii) both D1-2 in their letters signed in late September and early October proposing the Transformation {B3/4/34} {B3/4/32}. 396 Given the unwillingness of D1-2 properly to complete the Restructuring Plan, discussions took place with the NBU regarding alternative measures to recapitalise the Bank.334 Rozhkova explained that one option which would be acceptable to the IMF was to transfer problematic loans to operational companies which had sufficient and transparent sources of income to service the debts and would be able to provide proper security over physical assets.335 397 In early October 2016, D1-2 wrote to the NBU (i) asserting that they would not be able to comply in full with the Restructuring Plan; (ii) asking the NBU to consider a solvent nationalisation; and (iii) committing to restructuring the Bank’s corporate credit portfolio {B3/4/32-35}. Though light on detail, D1-2’s letters said this: “We admit that repayment of loans provided to large corporate entities are crucial for the bank’s future viability and minimizing the budget costs for the state, and therefore we will take all possible steps to ensure their repayment. Considering the above the ultimate owners of the bank herewith guarantee the following: …  332  The exceptions are the Celastrina, Denistron, Fiastra, Kembel, Nautis Trade and Vegatorg (Borrowers) and Tinto (Intermediary Borrower).  333  {E14/322}; Rozhkova1/¶¶178-179 {B1/5/45}. 334  Rozhkova1/¶¶198-206 {B1/5/49}. 335  Rozhkova1/¶¶202-203 {B1/5/50}; Rozhkova2/¶¶59 {B1/18/17}. This had its genesis in the September 2016 IMF Memorandum, which provided that banks could consider recapitalisation by “…consolidation of their [borrowers’] cash-flows with those of credit-worthy affiliated companies, subject to strict conditions…” {E15/125/81}. \nAA2/1/164\n 159 2) Restructuring of corporate credit portfolio based on market conditions by transferring the existing loans to operating companies, whose sources of income are real and transparent, clearly defining the repayment dates for such loans and ensuring quality maintenance of the loans. 3) Registering a collateral for the said loans at the market value and according to the requirements of the applicable law…” D1-2’s October 2016 letters to the NBU 398 In light of those commitments, on 5.10.16, the NBU adopted Decision 323-rsh/BT {E15/303} (“Decision 323”). That decision required the Bank to (i) submit to the NBU, by 12.10.16, “a Corporate Loan Restructuring (Transformation) Plan” under which loans would be transferred to “operating companies that have real and transparent sources of income” and be secured in accordance with NBU Resolutions 260 and 351; and (ii) appoint an internationally recognised auditor to update the Bank’s stress testing results, to verify the adequacy of the measures taken to restore its capital, and to assess the required amount of capital increase, the results of which were to be submitted to the NBU by 15.11.16. Decision 323 was intended to give D1-2 one final chance to recapitalise the Bank,336 notwithstanding their (admitted) failure to do so under the Restructuring Plan. 399 Despite Decision 323 requiring that the plan be provided by 12.10.16, the first draft was not forthcoming until 20.10.16 {E16/28}.

Indeed, the draft only addressed a small sub-set of borrowers (those in the petrochemical industry) and failed to provide information about deadlines for repayment and provision of additional collateral.337 It was not until 15.11.16 that the Bank provided the first draft of a comprehensive Transformation Plan covering UAH 111bn (c. US$4.3bn) of the corporate loan portfolio;338 a final version was submitted on 28.11.16 {E16/213}. By then, the Bank had unilaterally completed the process, but not remotely in line with the requirements of Decision 323. (2) The NBU’s alleged role in the Transformation 400 D1 contends that the NBU controlled the Transformation and used it as a means of artificially bankrupting the Bank. In particular, he argues that the NBU directed the Bank to use the New Borrowers, which it had chosen, and caused the Bank to issue the New Loans in a manner which released the existing (and, D1 says, adequate) security provided by the Share Pledges but without obtaining any appropriate replacement security. Consequently, D1 contends, the NBU is the true cause of the Bank’s inability to recover its pre- 336  Rozkhova/¶¶222-223 {B1/5/55}. 337  As the NBU explained in its letter of 27.10.16 {E16/57}. 338  {E16/128} and {E16/129}.  A further draft (relating to UAH 127bn of loans) was provided on 23.11.16  {E16/205} and {E16/206}. \nAA2/1/165\n 160 Transformation loans.339 401 This case is false. It is inherently incredible, unsupported by (and inconsistent with) documentary evidence, now also unsupported by any witness evidence from D1, and inconsistent with the agreed purpose of the Transformation (i.e. to replace existing loans to shell companies with loans to operating businesses with real sources of income and adequate security). For example: (1) Rozhkova explains that nobody at the NBU selected the New Borrowers or directed the Bank to issue the New Loans; to the contrary, the NBU only received information and documents on the New Borrowers after they had been identified by the Bank and once the New Loans had been issued.340 (2) A team of NBU staff was located at the Bank between October and December 2016 to perform an unscheduled on-site inspection, pursuant to NBU Decision 4274-r {E16/8}. Shekmar, an NBU official who led that inspection, confirms that (as with all inspections) his team’s role was limited, both in law and in practice, to requesting and analysing the Bank’s documents, identifying violations and making recommendations; and that his team did not have the power to give, and did not give, instructions to the Bank. Indeed, Shekmar’s team were only informed of New Loans after they had been issued and were only provided with files for the New Borrowers after that (and upon request).341 The Bank also obstructed and delayed the inspectors’ work, with Shekmar having to meet with Yatsenko on 1.11.16 to complain about the delay in providing requested documents.342 (3) The NBU also had a curator located at the Bank, whose principal role was to collect information and provide reports on the Bank’s activities to the NBU’s Oversight Department.343 The curator from February 2015 was Domashenko. She confirms that she observed and reported on the steps taken by the Bank pursuant to the Transformation Plan, but that she did not have any control over, or supervise, the Bank’s implementation of the Transformation Plan, nor did she play a part in  339  D1Def/¶48, ¶¶51-55 {A1/8/26}. 340  Rozhkova1/¶¶230-238 {B1/5/56-58}. 341  Shekmar/¶¶45, 53 and 56; Annex 1{B1/12/14, 17, 23}.  342  Shekmar/¶70 {B1/12/21}, referring to the comments made in"}

Indeed, the Bank acknowledged internally that the NBU was dissatisfied with how the Bank had undertaken the Transformation. For example, on 8.12.16, Korjak sent an email to Gurieva noting, inter alia, that “[a]fter transformation of loans, there are 30-40 new borrowers who the inspectors have already classified as defaulted” and that “[t]he NBU inspectors pointed out ‘doubtful’ loan collateral” {E17/23}; and on 9.12.16, Luchaninov reported that the NBU’s issues with the New Borrowers included “non-transparent ownership structure; lack of company cash flows; [and] small staff sizes” {E17/31}.346  403 When the NBU inspection team reported at the end of January 2017,347 it concluded that “the nature of the transactions performed and the inadequacy of the scope of activity of new borrowers, which are generally newly created companies, testify to the artificiality of the above and the fact that the transformation does not actually reduce the Bank’s risks”.  (3) The Transformation consisted of yet further illegitimate lending 404 D1-2 used the Transformation as an opportunity to engage in yet further illegitimate lending, with the apparent aims of (i) generally deferring the repayment of the existing loans by 8-10 years (i.e. with first repayments of the New Loans falling due between 2024 and 2026); and (ii) releasing the existing security (inadequate though it was) over shares in their companies. The following features of the Transformation are of particular significance.  405 First, D1-2 were behind the Transformation. D1-2 had personally written to the NBU committing to put in place a plan for “transferring the existing loans to operating companies which have real and transparent sources of income”: see ¶397 above. Moreover, D1-2 would necessarily have been involved in the Transformation, given that (i) it was a huge undertaking, involving about two thirds of the Bank’s entire corporate loan book;348 (ii) D1-2 knew that there was a serious risk that the Bank would be declared insolvent if it failed to complete the  344  Domashenko/¶11 and ¶¶55-57 {B1/14/5, 15}. See also Beketov8/¶382ff {C1/1/129}, describing the powers granted to curators under the applicable NBU Regulations. 345  See, for example: {E16/24} and {E16/32}; {E16/150.1}, in which Arnad Group was put forward as a New Borrower on 17.11.16; the New Loan to Arnad Group was issued on the following day: {F1/126}. 346  Further, BOK’s own internal analysis was that its credit risk would grow substantially as a result of the Transformation, principally due to “the absence of acceptable collateral on all new loans – 127bn UAH”  {E17/16}. 347  {E17/138}, {E17/140}, {E17/141}, {E17/142/20}. 348  The New Loans were in an aggregate sum of UAH 126.9bn.  The total value of “corporate loans” as at 31 December 2015 was UAH 188.8bn {K1/5/36}. \nAA2/1/167\n 162 Transformation; (iii) D1-2 owned and "}

The total value of “corporate loans” as at 31 December 2015 was UAH 188.8bn {K1/5/36}. \nAA2/1/167\n 162 Transformation; (iii) D1-2 owned and controlled the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers whose loans were purportedly to be repaid; and (iv) the Transformation was implemented through BOK, which was the part of the Bank which arranged transactions for the benefit of D1-2. 406 Second, and despite their denials,349 it is plain that the New Borrowers are yet further vehicles which are owned and controlled by D1-2. In particular:  (1) Bank employees told EY in November 2016 that although the New Borrowers had no business, they were “expected to take over the business from other companies (the ‘donor companies’) owned by the ultimate beneficial owners of the new borrowers” {E16/179/100}. The identified ‘donor companies’ are all companies D1-2 admit to owning.350 EY was also told the new loans would be secured by mortgages over the assets of companies, the vast majority of which are admitted D1-2 assets {E16/179/118}. (2) In 2017, D1-2 procured the New Borrowers to bring over 300 sets of proceedings against the Bank (see e.g. {H1/10.14}) in order to generate lis alibi pendens arguments through which to challenge the jurisdiction of the English courts: Reply/¶32.4 {A1/25/64}, {A5/10/39} at [129(a)-(c)], [146]-[147].  (3) There would be no reason for the New Borrowers to repay the indebtedness of the existing 193 Borrowers, or to take on massive debts to support the Bank’s purported efforts to improve its capitalisation, other than because those New Borrowers (and the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers) were related to D1-2. Neither D1 nor D2 has produced any evidence whatsoever as to the identity of the person(s) who were supposedly willing to take over billions of UAH of debt owed by the existing borrowers. 407 Third, even taking the information provided by the New Borrowers in support of their loan ‘applications’ at face value, they manifestly lacked either the income or assets necessary to repay the (massive) New Loans. For example, the SOFs demonstrate that, in their financial statements for the most recent period before the issuance of their New Loans, (i) 10 of the 36 New Borrowers reported no significant assets or revenue;351 and (ii) 30 of the 36 New  349  D1Def/¶49 {A1/8/26}; D2Def/¶67(5) {A1/18/32}.   350  Avias, Ukrtatnafta, Ukrnafta {E16/179/106}, NFP, OGOK, ZFP and Dniprazot {E16/179/109}, Biotrade and Shchedro {E16/179/113}. (D1-2 appear to have disposed of their interest in Shchedro in 2017).  351  Ador, Ailant, Agro-UTN, Arnag Group, Businessprom Invest, Denver-Oil, Imperia Holding, Kitcher-Development, Leks Grant, Santekh Master and Soft-Alliance.  These New Borrowers reported both assets and total income of less than UAH 50,000.  See Section A2(2) of the New Borrower SOFs. \nAA2/1/168\n 163 Borrowers reported losses: see {F1/120} to {F1/155}.  408 Fourth, the New Loans were arranged in a similar way to the previous illegitimate lending.  As the SOFs demonstrate: (i) the New Loans were initiated by BOK;352 (ii) New Loans were issued within one or two days of the date on which the New Borrower purportedly applied for its loan;353 and (iii) there was no genuine attempt to assess whether the New Borrower would be able to repay its New Loan or could provide adequate collateral.354    409 Fifth, the Transformation involved the Bank losing the limited security it had for the existing loans to the 193 Borrowers (by releasing the security, including the Share Pledges, which had been given for the earlier loans) but (despite the provision of proper collateral being an ess"}

Instead, the only purported security obtained by the Bank was (worthless) pledges over supposed contractual rights to receive goods: Rozhkova1/¶247 {B1/5/60}. 410 The Defendants do not appear to suggest that the New Loans were properly secured.  D1’s case, again, is to advance the baseless conspiracy theory that the NBU engineered the loss of the previous security in order to bankrupt the Bank. That is a bogus case that has no grounding in reality: (1) As Rozhkova explains,355 the NBU was willing to accept pledges over contractual rights on a temporary basis prior to completion of the Transformation provided that (i) they complied with the requirements then in force (i.e. Regulation 23); and (ii) there was a clear plan for the Bank to put in place security which met the new requirements (i.e. Regulation 351) before they came into force on 3.1.17 (at which time pledges over contractual rights would not be regarded as adequate security under any circumstances). However, the pledges over contractual rights did not even comply with Regulation 23, which (pursuant to the NBU’s guidance) required sufficient evidence that the future cash flows would in fact be received: Shekmar1/¶58 {B1/12/18}. Further, the Bank failed to provide any plan to put in place adequate security from 3.1.17. (2) It is inherently incredible that the NBU would have agreed to accept security of the very sort it was seeking to eradicate, particularly given that Decision 323 expressly required the Transformation Plan to conform with Regulation 351. There is not a  352  See Section A2(6)(c) of the New Borrower SOFs, for example {F1/120/2} (Absol Trade). 353  See Section A2(3)(b) of the New Borrower SOFs, for example {F1/120/2} (Absol Trade). 354  See Sections A2(6) and (7) of the New Borrower SOFs, for example {F1/120/2} (Absol Trade). 355  Rozhkova2/¶68 {B1/18/19}. \nAA2/1/169\n 164 jot of evidence to support the case that the NBU approved of the Bank releasing the Share Pledges or agreed to accept non-compliant security as adequate.   (3) The contemporaneous documents make clear that the NBU had specifically told the Bank that it required proper security which complied with NBU regulations.  In particular, the minutes of a meeting between the NBU’s inspection team and the Bank on 1.11.16 record that Shekmar told Yatsenko that “… the inspection team expects to receive, for verification,… acceptable loan security, which are transparent and comply with the NBU regulatory requirements” and “… new loan security must also comply with the requirements of Resolutions of the Board of the National Bank, No. 260 and No. 351”.356 (4) Further, the Bank’s internal communications are inconsistent with having received an assurance that the NBU would treat the security for the New Loans as adequate.  For example, in internal emails during December 2016, employees of the Bank acknowledged that the NBU inspectors would challenge the adequacy of the security (e.g. “The NBU inspectors pointed out ‘doubtful’ loan collateral (a 2-year reserve of the country’s petrol, large quantities of polyethylene)” {E17/23}) and that the absence of acceptable security would lead to a massive increase in the Bank’s reserves (e.g. “… the increase in credit risk on BOK borrowers will be +UAH 103 billion.  The main reason for this growth is the lack of acceptable collateral for all new loans… as well as a low settlement finan"}

The main reason for this growth is the lack of acceptable collateral for all new loans… as well as a low settlement financial class (8-9, for which the average risk level is 80%)” {E17/16}). (5) There was no good reason why the New Loans were not secured by share pledges: (i) the Bank swapped loans and borrowers in and out of the Share Pledges at will by way of amendment agreements – it could easily have added the New Loans to the existing Share Pledges; and (ii) the Bank prepared draft replacement share pledges which would have purportedly secured the New Loans357 – the Bank told EY (wholly implausibly) that “the signing of [the new share pledges] was delayed due to technical reasons (delays in transporting documents)” {E16/179/116}. 411 Sixth, the terms of the New Loans were uncommercial: (i) the principal of the New Loans was only repayable, in a single tranche, at the expiry of the 8-10 year term of the loan; (ii) the interest rate for the New Loans was just 10.5% per annum, which was generally lower than the interest rates in the existing loans which they replaced and also lower than the  356  {E16/65}.  Yatsenko is recorded as saying that “the legal form of new security agreements had not been determined yet (in progress) and that security will comply with the Resolution of the National Bank No. 23”. 357  See e.g. {E16/36.1}, {E16/36.2} {E16/36.3} {E16/36.4}. \nAA2/1/170\n 165 prevailing market rate;358 and (iii) the loan agreements simply referred in vague terms to security in the form of a “pledge agreement”.359  412 Seventh, the New Loans have not been – and will not be – repaid. Of the New Loans which ultimately repaid Relevant Drawdowns, only c. US$2.2m in principal has been paid.360 Accordingly, as a matter of fact, the Bank was still left with a hole in its balance sheet representing the amounts misappropriated from it (which hole was filled with a massive injection of taxpayer funds upon nationalisation): the experts agree that the Bank recognised a loss of UAH 135bn in its 2016 Financial Statements. (4) The consequences of the Transformation  413 The stated purpose of the Transformation was to allow D1-2 to replace earlier (illegitimate) loans to shell companies with (satisfactory) loans to genuine trading companies with sufficient income to service the loans and the ability to provide proper security. Instead, they used the Transformation to grant a further set of sham loans to worthless companies (never intending them to be repaid), making it even more difficult for the Bank to obtain redress for their fraud, including by deferring the due date of the loans and releasing the Share Pledges.   \n 358  The NBU ‘key policy rate’ (i.e. base-rate) was 14 or 15% when the New Loans were issued: {E18/259/3}.  359  See Section A2(8) of the New Borrower SOFs, for example {F1/120/3}(Absol Trade). 360  Thompson2/¶6.8 {D1/347/73}, Thompson2/App 6-1-2 {D1/424}.  \nAA2/1/171\n 166 I UKRAINIAN LAW I1 Introduction 414 Ukrainian law is relevant in two main respects.

The experts are: (i) Bank – Oleh Beketov; (ii) D1 – Oleg Alyoshin;363 (iii) D2 – Dmytro Marchukov; and (iv) D3-8 – Volodymyr Nahnybida. 415 In this Section, the Bank introduces the Ukrainian law principles relevant to (i) Ds’ liability in tort; (ii) attribution of knowledge; 364 and (iii) the question of whether the transactions which comprise the Misappropriation are void.365 Other issues of Ukrainian law (for example, as to causation, limitation and unjust enrichment) are addressed in subsequent Sections. 416 The Court will be familiar with the approach to be adopted when deciding contested questions of foreign law. A convenient summary is found in NBT at [929]-[938] {M1/22/298}, emphasising that “the task of the Court is to apply the law that a properly-directed court of the relevant jurisdiction would apply”. That should be read together with the Supreme Court’s decision in FS Cairo (Nile) Plaza LLC v Brownlie (No. 2) [2022] AC 995 {M1/28}, reaffirming the application of the presumption of sameness in English law. The latter point is of relevance, given that, on a number of issues, the Defendants’ experts argue – without the support of any Ukrainian case law – for some remarkable positions, which are strikingly different from the English law approach. I2 Ukrainian tort law 417 Art. 1166 of the Civil Code (“CC”) {C1/6/11} establishes the general basis for tort liability under Ukrainian law. The components of a claim under Art. 1166 are (i) unlawful conduct; (ii) harm; (iii) a causal link between the unlawful conduct and the harm; and (iv) fault: UkrJR/¶22.1 {C5/1/13}.  361  POC/¶33ff {A1/2/24}; D1Def/¶59ff {A1/8/33}; D2Def/¶36ff {A1/18/19}; D3-8Def/¶23ff {A1/20/17}; Reply/¶19.2 {A1/25/25}. 362  POC/¶42ff {A1/2/27}; Reply/¶19 {A1/25/25}; cf.

A defendant’s conduct will be deemed unlawful if it breaches, inter alia, any statutory duty owed by, or applicable to, him.366 419 Violation of civil rights: Arts. 3(1), 13(2) and 13(3) CC {C1/6/1} enshrine basic civil rights under Ukrainian law, including the “unacceptability of ownership deprivation”, the requirement that “[a] person exercising his civil rights shall refrain from any action that may breach the rights of others and/or damage the environment or cultural heritage” and the prohibition against “[a] person’s actions aimed at hurting other persons as well as abusing the right in other forms”. The Bank’s expert, Mr Beketov, is clear that a violation of any of these provisions constitutes ‘unlawful conduct’ for the purposes of Art. 1166. The Defendants’ experts disagree.367 The Bank’s case is that Mr Beketov’s view clearly represents Ukrainian law; his opinion is supported by a host of Supreme Court resolutions establishing a claimant’s right to rely directly upon a defendant’s breach of the claimant’s basic civil rights.368  420 D1’s expert, Mr Alyoshin, makes a number of further comments as to the (allegedly limited) scope of application of these civil rights principles.

In particular: (1) Mr Alyoshin suggests, without reference to authority, that the prohibition against ownership deprivation in Art. 3(1)(2) CC should be given a very limited meaning: he asserts that it “is not directed towards companies or individuals. The principle concerns the state to the extent that it exercises its powers as sovereign…”: UkrJR/¶32.3 {C5/1/16}. Mr Beketov disagrees. As he points out, (i) nothing in the wording of Art. 3(1) (which sets out six general principles of Ukrainian civil law) suggests that Art. 3(1)(2) should be so limited; and (ii) Supreme Court practice shows Art. 3(1)(2) being applied to disputes of a clearly private nature: Beketov9/¶147 {C6/1/55}. (2) Mr Alyoshin further states that Arts. 3 and 13 CC “are of a procedural nature and play no role in determining whether a substantive tortious claim has been established under Article 1166”: Alyoshin2/¶9 {C7/1/5}. However, against that are (i) the fact that these general principles form part of the Civil Code, and not the (separate) Code of Civil Procedure; (ii) the cases cited by Mr Beketov speak of these general principles as norms of direct application, without any limitation on their application; and (iii)  366  UkrJR/¶26 {C5/1/14}, ¶62.2 {C5/1/26}; Beketov8/¶89 {C1/1/30}. 367  UkrJR/¶28 {C5/1/14}, ¶¶31-36 {C5/1/15}.  368  See Beketov8/¶¶77-80 {C1/1/24}; Beketov9/¶¶133-138 {C6/1/49}. \nAA2/1/173\n 168 many of these cases did concern the application of the general principles to resolve substantive matters.369 421 Criminal conduct: It is common ground between the experts that a fraud involving the embezzlement or misappropriation of funds could constitute a crime and be punishable under Ukrainian criminal law: UkrJR/¶38.1 {C5/1/18}. At points in their reports, Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida (remarkably) appear to suggest that this somehow means that fraud of this type cannot be the subject of a civil law claim; Mr Alyoshin states, for example, that: “Ukrainian law does not have a generalised concept of ‘civil fraud’ … most forms of fraudulent behaviour are treated as a criminal matter under Ukrainian law”: Alyoshin1/¶231 {C2/1/86}. That is D1-2’s pleaded position.370 The Bank’s position is that it is plainly wrong:  (1) The Defendants’ experts have agreed in the Joint Report that “the defendant will be liable in tort to the extent that his or her conduct violates rules or prohibitions applicable to that defendant”;371 i.e. the same conduct may give rise to both criminal and tortious liability.  (2) Mr Alyoshin’s suggestion that the “misappropriation of property, for example by causing a person to enter into a contract with a third party by dishonest means … is not, in itself and without more, contrary to any provision of civil law” (echoed by Mr Nahnybida)372 can readily be dismissed. Where the victim is a bank and the misappropriation is orchestrated by its executives, the specific statutory duties described below are engaged. And, even absent the violation of such a duty, the misappropriation of property would, as Mr Beketov points out, constitute a breach of the general civil law principles enshrined in Art. 3(1) CC: Beketov9/¶166 {C6/1/64}. (2) The second element: harm 422 ‘Harm’ bears a broad meaning under Ukrainian law. Money, whether cash or in a bank account, is a form of property under the Civil Code, and tortious liability under Art. 1166 extends to economic loss: UkrJR/¶42 {C5/1/19}.

Rather, causation will be established on a case-by-case basis; Mr Beketov and Mr Alyoshin agree that the issue is a question of fact.373 The precise nature of the enquiry a Ukrainian court will  369  Such as, for example, PJSC ‘Bank Familnyi’ v Person 1 and others (Case No. 369/11268/16-ts; resolution dated 3.7.19): see Beketov8/¶79 {C1/1/25}. 370  D1/¶59(4) {A1/8/34}, D2/¶37(2) {A1/18/19}. 371  UkrJR/¶39.2 {C5/1/18}; Alyoshin2/¶121 {C7/1/45}; Nahnybida4/¶34 {C9/1/7}. 372  Alyoshin1/¶231 {C2/1/86}; Nahnybida4/¶34 {C9/1/7}. 373  UkrJR/¶40 {C5/1/18}; Alyoshin1/¶256 {C2/1/95}; Beketov9/¶44 {C6/1/18}. \nAA2/1/174\n 169 conduct when assessing whether causation is established is phrased differently by the experts; Mr Beketov frames the enquiry as a ‘but for’ analysis; Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida state that “the causal link must also be direct, necessary and inevitable”. As Mr Beketov points out, however, these distinctions are largely semantic.374 Causation in cases of joint and several liability for jointly caused harm under Art. 1190 is addressed at ¶436ff below. (4) The fourth element: fault 424 Pursuant to Arts. 1166(2) {C1/6/11-12} and 614 CC {C1/6/10}, fault is presumed, meaning that the burden of proof is on the defendant to establish that he was not at fault. ‘Fault’ can take the form of intent or negligence.375  (5) Remedies under Art. 1166 of the Civil Code 425 Pursuant to Arts 22 {C1/6/2}, 1166(1) {C1/6/11} and 1192 CC {C1/6/13}, the remedies available for tort claims under Art. 1166 include compensation in kind or damages in full.376 Subject to the requirement that harm should be compensated “in full”, quantification of loss (like causation) is a question of fact as a matter of Ukrainian law: Beketov8/¶109 {C1/1/37}. Ukrainian law therefore does not have detailed legal principles governing matters such as remoteness or credit for benefits; these are left to the court to resolve in evaluating what harm has, in fact, been suffered by the victim of the tort.  (6) Specific statutory duties  426 The Civil Code, the JSC Law and the Law on Banks all set out specific statutory duties owed by officers/executives to their company/bank, commonly referred to as ‘fiduciary duties’. Breach of those duties (by way of action or omission) does not give rise to a separate cause of action, but will constitute ‘unlawful conduct’ for the purposes of a tortious claim under Art. 1166.377 (a) Civil Code  427 Art. 92(3) CC {C1/6/3-4} states that “[a] body or person who according to the constitutional documents of the legal entity or the law acts in the name of the legal entity is obligated to act in the best interests of the legal entity in good faith and reasonably and not exceed its authority …”. 428 Mr Beketov and Mr Alyoshin agree that the duties set out in Art. 92(3) are owed by members of a company’s bodies (such as its supervisory or management board) and those with  374  UkrJR/¶41 {C5/1/19}; Beketov9/¶189 {C6/1/78}. 375  UkrJR/¶48 {C5/1/21}; Beketov8/¶172 {C1/1/57}. 376  UkrJR/¶50 {C5/1/22}; Beketov8/¶69 {C1/1/22} and ¶106 {C1/1/35}. 377  Beketov8/¶¶202-203 {C1/1/67}; UkrJR/¶62 {C5/1/26}. \nAA2/1/175\n 170 authority to act in the company’s name; however, Mr Alyoshin suggests that those duties only apply “when and to the extent that [the members] act towards third parties on the company’s behalf” or “when they vote on corporate decisions that are subsequently put into effect by way of making transactions with third parties”: UkrJR/¶64 {C5/1/26}.

But, as Mr Beketov points out, there is no basis in the wording of Art. 92(3) to limit the scope of the duties imposed in this manner; furthermore, Mr Alyoshin’s interpretation would have the illogical effect of meaning that company officers would not owe any duties under Art. 92(3) when (for example) engaging in decision-making regarding internal company affairs: Beketov9/¶¶252-253 {C6/1/106}. On his view, the correct position – consistent with a Supreme Court resolution confirming that Art. 92 “refers to fiduciary duties and joint and several liability of members of the management bodies of the bank as a whole, and not only those members of the executive body who represent the bank in relations with third parties”378 – is that Art. 92(3) is not so limited.  429 Mr Alyoshin’s contention forms part of a more general argument he advances not only in relation to Art. 92 CC, but also the other ‘fiduciary duties’ found in the JSC Law and the Law on Banks (discussed below), namely that “such duties arise when the executives perform their roles (i.e. when they act in their capacities as such)”: Alyoshin2/¶99 {C7/1/37}. The Bank denies that the scope of the duties owed by officers/executives is limited in this way:379 as Mr Beketov explains,380 the perverse outcome of Mr Alyoshin’s interpretation is that executives may evade liability for breach of fiduciary duty, even where they have actively sought to defraud their bank, provided they use “means not involving dealings with third parties on the company’s behalf or the casting of formal votes”. (b) JSC Law  430 Art. 63(1) of the JSC Law {C1/21/3} states that “[t]he officers of a joint stock company’s bodies shall act in the interests of the company, follow the requirements of the law, provisions of the charter and other documents of the company”. The ‘officers’ of a company include (inter alios) members of the company’s supervisory board; it is common ground that the “other documents of the company” referred to in Art. 63(1) include (in the instant case) the Bank’s Supervisory Board Regulations, Management Board Regulations, Credit Committee Regulations and Lending Procedures Manual.381  378  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 21.7.21 in DGF v Person 1 et al (Case No. 910/12930/18), referred to by Mr Alyoshin at Alyoshin1/¶¶215-218 {C2/1/81}; see Beketov9/¶254 {C6/1/107}.  379  Reply/¶14.3A {A1/25/22}. 380  Beketov9/¶253 {C6/1/106}. 381  Art. 2(1)(15) JSC Law {C1/21/1}; UkrJR/¶¶65.1, 65.3 {C5/1/27}. \nAA2/1/176\n 171 431 Art. 51 of the JSC Law (as in force throughout the relevant period382) {C1/21/2} imposes further duties on the members of a company’s supervisory board as regards non-delegation of duty. In particular, Art. 51(4) provides that “[m]embers of the supervisory board shall perform their duties personally and may not delegate their powers to another person, except for a member of the supervisory board that is a corporate shareholder”. In a similar vein, Art. 52(3) of the JSC Law {C6/3/156} states that “[t]he matters exclusively reserved for a supervisory board of a joint stock company may not be decided by any other bodies of that company, other than general meetings, except as provided for in this Law”: Beketov8/¶212(b) {C1/1/70}. 432 In the Bank’s case, its internal documents made express provision for the approval of loans with specified characteristics to be within the exclusive competence of the Supervisory Board. In particular, at all relevant times (i) the Bank’s Credit Committee Regulations required all loans exceeding US$2m in value (whether with related parties or not) to be submitte"}

In particular, at all relevant times (i) the Bank’s Credit Committee Regulations required all loans exceeding US$2m in value (whether with related parties or not) to be submitted to the Supervisory Board for approval; (ii) the Bank’s Charter reserved, as a matter within “the exclusive competence of the Supervisory Board [which] cannot be decided by other bodies of the Bank, except for the General Meeting of the Bank”, the approval of transactions with related parties exceeding a market value of US$500,000 (or equivalent); and (iii) the Bank’s SB Regulations contained an identical clause to that in the Bank’s Charter.383 433 As described at ¶429 above, Mr Alyoshin argues generally that the ‘fiduciary duties’ imposed by (inter alia) Art. 63 of the JSC Law are engaged only when the officer in question is acting in his capacity as such and not, for example, where the officer defrauds the company by acting outwith his formal capacity. For the reasons also set out at ¶429, the Bank’s case is that this surprising proposition does not represent Ukrainian law.  (c) Law on Banks 434 The Law on Banks imposes duties on a bank’s “executives”, which is defined to include (inter alios) the chairman, his deputies and members of the supervisory board: UkrJR/¶69.1 {C5/1/28}. In particular, Art. 42 (in force from 10.1.15) {C1/23/6} imposes duties upon a bank’s executives that mirror those imposed by Art. 63 of the JSC Law on a company’s officers: UkrJR/¶69.2 {C5/1/28}. In addition, Art. 43 of the Law on Banks (in force at all relevant times) {C1/23/6} places heightened duties upon bank executives inter alia to “act for the benefit of the bank and its clients and … place the interests of the bank above their own when  382  The version of Art. 51(4) set out below was in force from 2.3.11 to 30.4.16: Beketov8/¶211 {C1/1/69}. 383  See cl. 2.4 of the Credit Committee Regulations {C1/220/8} {C1/221/9}; cl. 9.3.3(45) and the final paragraph of cl. 9.3.3 of the Bank’s Charter {C1/210/24} {C1/211/15}; cl. 3.1.45 and the final paragraph of cl. 3.1 of the SB Regulations {C1/215/5} {C1/216/5}; Beketov8/¶¶212-213 {C1/1/70}. \nAA2/1/177\n 172 performing their obligations in accordance with the requirements of this Law”. 435 Mr Alyoshin disagrees with the proposition, thought by Mr Beketov to be “self-evident”, that “a member of the supervisory board who orchestrates or otherwise participates in a scheme to embezzle funds from their bank will necessarily breach their duties to the bank under Article 43 of the Law on Banks”: UkrJR/¶74 {C5/1/30}. The basis for his disagreement is that whether or not a breach has been committed “will depend both on the role of the executive and the actual acts committed as part of the scheme”;384 this is part of his more general argument that bank executives only owe fiduciary duties when they are acting in their formal role as such. (7) Joint and several liability for jointly caused harm  436 Art. 1190(1) CC provides that “[p]ersons by whose joint actions or failure to act harm was caused shall bear joint and several responsibility to the victim” {C1/6/12}. It is common ground that causing harm by “joint actions or failure to act” – i.e. jointly caused harm – means causing “indivisible harm by interrelated, cumulative [or collective] actions or actions with unity of intent”.385 437 The experts disagree as to whether it is a necessary precondition to Art. 1190 that all elements of tortious liability under Art. 1166 – and, specifically, causation – must be established in relation to each co-defendant independently: UkrJR/¶59 {C5/1/25}. The Bank says that the correct position is that there is no such requirement, and"}
{"start": 483000, "text": "to act” – i.e. jointly caused harm – means causing “indivisible harm by interrelated, cumulative [or collective] actions or actions with unity of intent”.385 437 The experts disagree as to whether it is a necessary precondition to Art. 1190 that all elements of tortious liability under Art. 1166 – and, specifically, causation – must be established in relation to each co-defendant independently: UkrJR/¶59 {C5/1/25}. The Bank says that the correct position is that there is no such requirement, and the question instead is whether the claimant has suffered an indivisible harm caused by the actions of the joint tortfeasors when taken together: Beketov9/¶229ff {C6/1/93}. In other words, where a tort involves jointly caused harm (as described above), the element of causation for the purpose of Art. 1166 CC is established in a collective manner. 438 That conclusion is supported by a number of resolutions of the Supreme Court,386 including the Bank Kyiv case, in which joint and several liability was imposed in proceedings brought by a bank against (i) two officers of a company to which it had loaned monies that had not been repaid; and (ii) the director of the company to which the borrower had paid the funds. The Supreme Court rejected the appeal of the director, premised on the absence of a causal connection between his individual conduct and the bank’s loss; it noted that “persons who jointly caused indivisible harm by their interrelated joint actions or actions with the unity of intent shall be  384  UkrJR/¶74.2 {C5/1/30}. 385  UkrJR/¶56.3 {C5/1/24}; there is a disagreement between the experts as to whether “cumulative” or “collective” is a better translation of the language used in the Ukrainian text.  386  As discussed in Beketov8/¶¶186-196 {C1/1/61}; Beketov9/¶¶232-239 {C6/1/94}. \nAA2/1/178\n 173 jointly and severally liable before the injured party”.387  439 The Bank’s position is also consistent with first principles: the interpretation favoured by the Defendants’ experts would render meaningless the Supreme Court’s pronouncement that Art. 1190 “covers events where it is impossible to determine what, and to what extent, action led to that consequence”,388 and would produce the absurd result that fraudsters acting with unity of intent could escape liability in tort by arranging the fraud in such a way as to allow each of them to argue that their own acts alone did not cause the harm but only did so because they had worked together. (8) Competition of claims 440 Tortious claims and contracts of employment: It is common ground between Mr Beketov and Mr Alyoshin that a claim under Art. 1166 CC can be brought against an officer or employee of a company “where the employee’s unlawful conduct amounts to a breach of that officer or employee’s duties under the Civil Code or the JSC Law or the Law on Banks”.389 Mr Alyoshin acknowledges that this is “apparent from a number of recent cases where the courts have imposed liability on bank officials under these circumstances, applying Article 1166 in conjunction with Article 92 of the Civil Code and/or provisions of company or bank insolvency legislation”: Alyoshin1/¶180 {C2/1/66}. It is further common ground that such a claim can be pursued where the allegations go beyond the employee’s “performance or non-performance of his duties under his contract with the Bank”.390  441 Nevertheless, Mr Alyoshin contends that a claim for breach of an executive/officer’s fiduciary duties would not be capable of being pursued in tort; rather, the claimant “would be limited to bringing a claim against them in contract for non-performance of their employment or service obligations”: UkrJR/¶97.2 {C5/1/38}. The Bank disputes that this position represents Ukrainian law. It is inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s decisions in Ukoopspilka,391 to which Mr Alyoshin himself refers, and Trust Bank, in which senior members of a bank’s management and supervisory boards were found liable under Art. 1166 CC for breach of"}

His purported justification for this conclusion is that “the existence of contractual relations excludes tortious liability … even where a contract is voidable or void”: UkrJR/¶47.2 {C5/1/21}. The Bank contends that there is no authority to support Mr Alyoshin’s stance, and it is unprincipled: if a contract is void, there are by definition no “contractual relations” whose effect falls to be considered. To the contrary, as Mr Beketov points out: (1) Where multiple causes of action are available to a claimant arising out of a particular set of facts, the claimant is generally free to choose which to pursue: UkrJR/¶47.1 {C5/1/21}. The Supreme Court has confirmed as much, observing that “the plaintiff has the opportunity to choose a more advantageous claim”. Double recovery is avoided because “[t]he realisation of one of these rights lead to the termination of the other”.393 (2) In the present case, the Bank’s tortious claim is founded upon misappropriation of its monies pursuant to a fraudulent scheme involving the conclusion of sham loan agreements, rather than the non-fulfilment of contractual obligations by the Borrowers under those agreements. The fact that a remedy in tort is available to a bank in such circumstances is illustrated by PJSC Ukrsibbank v Persons 1-8,394 in which a bank successfully brought a claim under Arts 1166 and 1190 against defendants who had embezzled funds through a fraudulent lending scheme: Beketov9/¶208 {C6/1/88}.  (3) In the Finance and Credit Bank Case,395 the Supreme Court described a number of ways in which a bank’s majority shareholders could cause it tortious harm, including through means which would involve the bank entering into contracts; it made no suggestion that the existence of such contracts would preclude tortious liability.  392  Alyoshin1/¶182 {C2/1/67}; Beketov8/¶281 {C1/1/90}; Beketov9/¶184(e) {C6/1/76}. 393  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 27.10.21 (Case No. 752/20739/15-ts), quoted at Beketov9/¶205 {C6/1/86}. 394  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 4.6.21 (Case No. 753/21343/14-ts), quoted at Beketov8/¶189 {C1/1/62}. 395  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 20.1.21 (Case No. 197/1330-14-ц), discussed at Beketov9/¶209 {C6/1/88} and ¶190 {C6/1/78}. \nAA2/1/180\n 175 I3 Attribution of knowledge 443 Ukrainian legislatio"}

The experts disagree as to the circumstances in which knowledge will be attributed to a company. Mr Beketov considers that whether a particular person’s knowledge will be attributed to a company is a question of fact, and that “a Ukrainian court would likely take a common sense approach to determining how and under what circumstances the knowledge of a natural person associated with a company will be attributed to that company”, placing weight in particular on the degree to which the person whose knowledge is to be attributed was in a position to exercise formal or informal influence over that company.396 Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida take a much narrower and formalistic view, concluding that “a company will be deemed to have knowledge of the persons who are authorised to act on its behalf in the relevant context … Thus, the main individual at a bank whose knowledge is relevant for the purposes of determining that bank’s knowledge is the Chairman of the Executive Board”.397 444 The Bank’s case is that Mr Beketov’s is the more plausible statement of Ukrainian law, given that it (i) avoids the excessive formalism of the Defendants’ experts’ statement; (ii) is consistent with the Ukrainian law approach to determining issues of ownership and control, which looks to the (decidedly informal) test of “decisive influence”;398 and (iii) is also consistent with Ukrainian case law, and, specifically, a succession of decisions in which the knowledge of persons holding no formal authority – including shareholders and beneficial owners – was nevertheless attributed to the companies concerned.399 445 It is common ground between Mr Beketov, Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida that “the knowledge of a person who is authorised to act on behalf of a company will not be attributed to that company if such person aims to defraud it”: UkrJR/¶110.3 {C5/1/43}. Mr Beketov further suggests – consistently with his opinion that attribution is a question of fact on which the Ukrainian courts will take a common-sense approach – that this principle “applies to any person who is aiming to defraud the company”: Beketov9/¶399ff {C6/1/155}. I4 Void transactions  (1) Void and voidable transactions generally 446 Art. 215 CC (“Invalidity of a transaction”) {C1/6/5} explains that invalid transactions may be  396  Beketov8/¶176 {C1/1/58}; UkrJR/¶109.1 {C5/1/42}. 397  UkrJR/¶109.2 {C5/1/42}; see also D1Def/¶63(2) {A1/8/39}.  398  Beketov9/¶396 {C6/1/152}, cross-referring to (i) the definition of ‘controller’ pursuant to Art. 2 of the Law on Banks (discussed at Beketov8/¶334ff {C1/1/110}; and (ii) the definition of “ultimate beneficiary” (discussed at Beketov8/¶353ff {C1/1/117}). 399  Beketov9/¶397ff {C6/1/152}; Beketov8/¶180 {C1/1/59}. \nAA2/1/181\n 176 either ‘void’ or ‘voidable’: (1) A ‘void’ transaction is deemed to be invalid ab initio by operation of law: UkrJR/¶5.4 {C5/1/5}. Art. 215(2) makes clear that no court order, nor any other special action, is required to set aside a void transaction; however, a claimant may bring a claim seeking to give effect to the consequences of the transaction’s invalidity (as to which see ¶447 below).400  (2) A ‘voidable’ transaction is one which “is not expressly held invalid by law”, but which “may be held invalid by court” should “any one of the parties or another interested party challenge[ ] its validity on legal ground"}

Art. 215(2) makes clear that no court order, nor any other special action, is required to set aside a void transaction; however, a claimant may bring a claim seeking to give effect to the consequences of the transaction’s invalidity (as to which see ¶447 below).400  (2) A ‘voidable’ transaction is one which “is not expressly held invalid by law”, but which “may be held invalid by court” should “any one of the parties or another interested party challenge[ ] its validity on legal grounds”.401 447 The experts disagree as to whether a court decision is required in order for a transaction to be void; Mr Beketov’s view (consistent with the fact that a void transaction is deemed invalid by operation of law) is that no such decision is required; Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida take the contrary view: UkrJR/¶8 {C5/1/6}. In practical terms, however, the difference between the experts may be largely semantic. It now appears to be agreed that voidness arises as a matter of law (rather than being the subject of judicial discretion), and that where there is a litigated dispute between the parties to a transaction as to whether or not it is void, the role of the court is to investigate and establish the relevant facts and law and confirm which of the parties’ positions is correct.402 It is also agreed that a court order is required should a claimant seek relief from the consequences of voidness (such as, for example, restitution or compensation);403 however, the Bank’s Ukrainian law claims in these proceedings do not seek relief as a consequence of a transaction being void. Rather, they are freestanding claims brought in tort and unjust enrichment: Beketov9/¶41 {C6/1/17}. (2) Transactions contrary to public policy under Art. 228(2) CC 448 Pursuant to Art. 228(2) CC {C1/6/6}, a transaction that is contrary to public policy is void (rather than voidable).404 In order to be considered contrary to public policy, a transaction must be “aimed at (i) violating constitutional human and civil rights and freedoms, or (ii) destructing or damaging or misappropriating any property of a company or individual …”.405 As part of this test, it is necessary for at least one of the parties to have known (actually or constructively) that the  400  See also Art. 236(1) CC {C1/6/7}; Beketov8/¶32 {C1/1/9}; UkrJR/¶5.8 {C5/1/5}. 401  Art. 215(3) CC {C1/6/6}; UkrJR/¶5.5 {C5/1/5}. 402  Beketov9/¶29, {C6/1/12}; Nahnybida4/¶101 {C9/1/22}. 403  UkrJR/¶5.8 {C5/1/6}; Beketov9/¶40 {C6/1/16}. 404  UkrJR/¶11.1 {C5/1/8}. Art. 228(3) CC, on the other hand, provides that transactions that are contrary to the interests and moral principles of the state and society are voidable. The Bank does not rely on Art. 228(3), however, and references below to Art. 228 should be understood to refer to Art. 228(2). 405  Art. 228(1) {C1/6/6}; UkrJR/¶11.3 {C5/1/8}. \nAA2/1/182\n 177 transaction was contrary to public policy: UkrJR/¶11.4 {C5/1/8}. 449 As Mr Beketov points out, Ukrainian courts have held that Art. 228 CC applies to transactions concluded between private actors, where that transaction involves the violation of a person’s (constitutionally protected) property rights; he cites a series of examples at Beketov8/¶¶38-40 {C1/1/11} and Beketov9/¶¶68-72 {C6/1/28}. 450 Mr Alyoshin seeks to argue that there is an unwritten limit confining Art. 228 CC to cases of criminal conduct where there has been a conviction, asserting that “[t]he case law … consistently demonstrates that a finding that a transaction is so socially dangerous as to violate public policy is only possible where there is a criminal verdict establishing the illegality of the transaction”.406 However, Mr Beketov points out that this proposition is contradicted by the Supreme Court’s decision in Agrofirma, in which a sale and purchase agreement was confirmed to be void under Art. 228 CC in the absence of any prior criminal verdict.407 The Bank will also say that Mr Alyoshin’s proposition is contrary to principle, as its e"}

(3) Transactions under Art. 235 CC 451 Art. 235(1) CC {C1/6/7} states that “[a] transaction shall be sham if it has been concluded by the parties for the purposes of concealing another transaction, which they actually concluded”. Art. 235(2) CC states that, where such a sham is established, “the relations between the parties shall be governed by the rules applicable” to the transaction they actually concluded. Although Art. 235 CC is not expressed in terms of invalidity or voidness, its practical effect is that the transaction the parties purported to enter into has no legal effect;408 instead, the court “shall proceed on the basis that the parties entered into the transaction that they had in mind, and examine the substance of the case applying the laws regulating the latter transaction. If that [transaction] is contrary to law, the court must decide to declare it invalid and apply, as necessary, the relevant legal consequences”.409 452 The experts agree that a sham (aka ‘mock’) loan transaction can conceal a transaction which gives rise to a tortious claim. As Mr Beketov puts it, “if two parties enter into a loan agreement with the aim, not that the money will be repaid, but rather to misappropriate the lender’s money, then Article 235 may be applied in conjunction with Article 228, the latter governing the true transaction (being a  406  Alyoshin2/¶184 {C7/1/64}; see also Nahnybida3/¶¶208.3-208.5 {C4/1/34}. 407  Beketov9/¶¶72 {C6/1/29} and 76 {C6/1/31}, citing Person 1 v Agrofirma ‘Slavutych’ PE (Resolution of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court dated 2.11.21 in case No. 917/1338/18).

Pursuant to the VCFP doctrine, a court may, in its discretion, refuse to declare a contract invalid if the party requesting the declaration has by its conduct or representations led the other party to the litigation reasonably to believe that the transaction is valid, and that other party has acted on such a belief to its detriment. When exercising its discretion, the court will consider whether the party seeking to declare the transaction invalid acted unfairly or male fides.413   455 Mr Beketov and Mr Alyoshin disagree as to whether the doctrine is capable of application in the cas"}

When exercising its discretion, the court will consider whether the party seeking to declare the transaction invalid acted unfairly or male fides.413   455 Mr Beketov and Mr Alyoshin disagree as to whether the doctrine is capable of application in the case of void (rather than voidable) transactions. Mr Beketov’s view is that it cannot: he points out that voidness arises by operation of law, and is therefore not subject to discretionary principles like VCFP; furthermore, none of the Supreme Court resolutions cited by Mr Alyoshin in support of the contrary position in fact concerns void transactions.414 456 Remarkably, Mr Alyoshin suggests in his third report – for the first time – that detrimental reliance does not form part of the VCFP doctrine.415 Not only is that assertion contrary to  410  UkrJR/¶13.4 {C5/1/10}; Beketov8/¶45 {C1/1/14}. Mr Beketov further notes that, in the JSC Chornomornaftogaz case, the Supreme Court adopted an alternative analysis by applying Art. 228 directly to the sham loan agreement the parties had purported to conclude without expressly addressing Art. 235. 411  UkrJR/¶9 {C5/1/7}. 412  Beketov8/¶¶270-271 {C1/1/86}, referring to Art. 53 of the Code of Civil Procedure and Art. 50 of the Code of Commercial Procedure; Beketov9/¶¶42-51 {C6/1/17}.

That is again wrong: see Beketov11/¶133ff {C9.2/1/51}. 457 D1 additionally suggests in his Defence that inconsistent conduct may be precluded where a claimant is acting “in bad faith or abusing its rights” generally: Alyoshin3/¶71 {C9.1/1/33}. However, as Mr Beketov points out, those basic principles are embodied, in relation to allegations of inconsistency, in the specific doctrine of VCFP: Beketov11/¶220ff {C9.2/1/84}. There is no wider, or more open-textured, defence in play.   \n 416  D1Def/¶70(3B) {A1/8/41}; see Beketov11/¶134 {C9.2/1/51} for a summary of the places where Mr Alyoshin has offered contrary evidence.  \nAA2/1/185\n 180 J LIABILITY OF D1-2  458 In this Section, the Bank outlines its case as to why, applying the principles of Ukrainian law set out in Section I above, D1-2’s conduct in orchestrating the Misappropriation (as described in Section F above) satisifes the four elements required for liability under Art. 1166 CC, such that they are each liable to compensate the Bank for the fraud perpetrated against it.  In doing so, the Bank identifies D1-2’s various responses to its case, and outlines why it contends that those are untenable.  459 The Bank’s case as to how D1-2 procured the Misappropriation has been described above. But, by way of recap, the key points (and the sections in which they can be found) are as follows:  (1) D1-2 controlled the Bank (Section D): D1-2 together owned 90%+ of the Bank’s shares and controlled its general meeting of participants (the Bank’s supreme management body) and Supervi"}

But, by way of recap, the key points (and the sections in which they can be found) are as follows:  (1) D1-2 controlled the Bank (Section D): D1-2 together owned 90%+ of the Bank’s shares and controlled its general meeting of participants (the Bank’s supreme management body) and Supervisory Board, allowing them in turn to control membership of the Bank’s Management Board. D1-2 stacked the latter with individuals who would do their bidding, such as Dubilet, Gurieva, Yatsenko and Novikov. The notion that Bank employees would do anything other than follow instructions given by D1-2 or their lieutenants is fanciful: D1-2 are high-profile oligarchs, Bank staff feared for their jobs, and D1 was and is a man to be feared (for example, he described himself to Rozhkova as a “tiger in a cage” and as having “long arms”; he organised threatening protests involving coffins, wreaths and funeral bands; BOK staff couldn’t write his name in lower case and observed “He’s EVERYWHERE”).  (2) D1-2’s lieutenants organised the fraud (Sections C to F): the Relevant Loans to 47 of the Borrowers came from Gurieva’s BOK; Dubilet chaired the ECC meetings at which each Relevant Loan was approved and signed the vast majority of the Relevant Loans themselves; Gurieva voted in favour of 129 Relevant Loans and Novikov in favour of 127 of them. Gurieva’s department produced absurd expert analyses in support of the lending. And a combination of BOK, PBC and Primecap administered the drafting/execution of documents relating to the Relevant Loans, Intermediary Loans, RSAs, 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings, Asset Transfer, New Loans etc. It is extraordinarily unlikely that D1-2’s key lieutenants, with whom they remain on cosy terms (for example, Novikov texted D1-2 hundreds of times during the return date hearing; Gurieva was the captain of D1’s Lafferty Spreadsheet team), \nAA2/1/186\n 181 were defrauding D1-2’s bank if not on D1-2’s instructions and for their benefit.  (3) D1-2 owned and controlled the Borrowers, Intermediary Borrowers, D3-8 and their alleged principals (Section G): the Bank’s largely unchallenged Structure and Nominee Charts show how the same vehicles were used time and again to hold these companies, many of which appear in the byzantine structures by which D1-2 hold their admitted assets. The individuals involved are principally PBC and former Bank employees, large numbers of whom hold valuable assets for D1-2 under oral agreements, such that they can only be D1-2’s highly trusted associates. There are a raft of other telling points, such as the fact that D1-2 admit majority interests in four Borrowers and minority interests in many more (with the other Borrowers held in near-identical fashion); that the Bank’s top brass spent a good part of 2015 shuffling the pack of directors and nominees to conceal from the NBU the Bank’s related-party lending to the Borrowers; and that D1-2 have been funding D6-8’s defence of this claim through Sanderlyn and Versala. (4) D1-2 used their own assets (Sections F, H): The Share Pledges, which supposedly secured the Relevant Loans, granted security over D1-2’s own (admitted) assets. This is another telling indication of D1-2’s ownership of the Borrowers, which they seek to sidestep by saying that they knew virtually nothing about the (grossly overvalued and ultimately released) pledges that had been given. And then, when the NBU insisted that the Bank be recapitalised, it was D1-2’s assets that were transferred (or purportedly transferred) to the Bank (again at gross overvalue) in purported discharge of the Relevant Loans. Once more D1-2 seek to avoid the implications of this fact by feigning ignorance of the Asset Transfer process in a wholly incredible manner.  (5) Other points (Sections A to G): Further sti"}

Once more D1-2 seek to avoid the implications of this fact by feigning ignorance of the Asset Transfer process in a wholly incredible manner.  (5) Other points (Sections A to G): Further still:   (a) D1-2 have still not provided any sort of explanation (let alone an innocent one) for the Misappropriation or the plethora of obviously sham documents it involved, despite the assurance given at the jurisdictional stage by D1 that “obviously, if the matter ever goes to trial one would need to explain what was going on and why this was being done and so on, whether there was any dishonest intent”.  (b) D1-2 were joined at the hip: they committed the fraud together, and did so with each other’s knowledge, encouragement and sanction. Insofar as one of them gave instructions for particular transactions in furtherance of the \nAA2/1/187\n 182 fraud, he did so with the express, implied or standing approval of the other, as their lieutenants (e.g. Dubilet, Gurieva, Novikov, Yatsenko and Melnyk) well knew: Bank RRFI/¶¶A, C, E-F {A2/4/4-5}.417 (c) There are significant adverse inferences to be drawn against D1-2 in relation to (i) the failure of D1-2, and the other witnesses who gave statements on D1’s behalf, to give evidence at trial; (ii) D1-2’s failure to call their key lieutenants (especially Novikov, Gurieva, Dubilet, Anischenko and Melnyk); and (iii) D1-2’s still deficient disclosure – they have got rid of their no doubt highly incriminating instant message exchanges from 2013-14.  J1 The first element: unlawful conduct  460 D1-2 breached (i) their general duty not to violate the Bank’s basic civil rights under the Civil Code, and (ii) specific duties which they owed to the Bank under the Civil Code, the JSC Law and the Law on Banks. These breaches of legal duty (both separately and cumulatively) constitute “unlawful conduct” for the purposes of Art. 1166 CC. 461 The conduct of D1-2 which gives rise to the breaches of duty summarised above comprises, in overarching terms, their procurement – using their ownership and control of the Bank and the corporate entities involved in the fraud – of the Misappropriation: see POC/¶52 {A1/2/29}. More particularly, D1-2 caused or procured: (1) The Bank to grant the Relevant Loans to the Borrowers, in a manner flagrantly contrary to the Bank’s basic lending procedures, in spite of the Borrowers’ lack of credit or trading history and obvious inability to repay the sums loaned to them, and for the purpose of misappropriating monies from the Bank.  (2) The subsequent transfer of the Relevant Drawdowns back and forth between  417  This is demonstrated by a range of further material, including (i) Rozhkova’s evidence that D1 repeatedly told her in the context of the Restructuring Plan that he would need to check various matters with D2: Rozkhova1/¶¶181, 198 {B1/5/46}; (ii) the WhatsApps exchanged between D1-2 at around the time these proceedings were instituted in December 2017 and in late 2019 in relation to protests organised outside the NBU (see Section C above); (iii) D2’s delegation of his Primecap disclosure exercise to D1 (see ¶185); (iv) D1’s frequent approval of payments in relation to D1-2’s jointly owned businesses; (v) D1 receiving near-daily balance updates for accounts maintained by D1-2 companies, by D2 companies and even in relation to D2’s personal bank accounts (¶69 above); (vi) D2’s pleading and evidence in the Pinchuk Proceedings: {I3/4/4} (¶12(b) and {I3/13/1} (¶¶55, 61, 65, 95); (vii) D2 being happy to sit back and allow D1 to be responsible selling his interest in KZhRK {H2/63/4} (¶19) and then for collecting in his US$500m interest in the KZhRK Receivable: {A5/21/12} (¶¶48, 66"}

In the present case, D1-2 violated the Bank’s rights under (i) Art. 3(1)(2) and/or Art. 13(2) {C1/6/1}, in that they deprived the Bank of the ownership of its monies (via their procurement of the Relevant Drawdowns for the purposes of the Misappropriation) in a manner not provided for by the Constitution of Ukraine or Ukrainian law generally; and (ii) Art. 13(3) {C1/6/1}, in that they exercised their rights with the intention of injuring the Bank or in an otherwise abusive manner. (2) Breach of specific duties (a) Article 63 of the JSC Law 464 D1-2 were both ‘officers’ of the Bank for the purposes of the JSC Law, being members of the Supervisory Board throughout the relevant period. They were accordingly obliged, pursuant to Art. 63(1) JSC Law {C1/21/3}, to “act in the interests of the company, follow the requirements of the law, provisions of the charter and other documents of the company”. 465 D1-2 both breached that duty in numerous respects, given that: (1) They caused or procured the Misappropriation, which was contrary to both the interests of the Bank and basic principles of Ukrainian civil law.  (2) The Relevant Loans were (i) entered into without the approval of the Supervisory Board, in contravention of the Bank’s Charter, the Credit Committee Regulations and the SB Regulations; and (ii) on terms that, in any event, could never have been validly authorised: POC/¶52(2) {A1/2/30}. In causing the Bank to conclude these agreements with the Borrowers, D1-2 failed not only to act in the interests of the Bank, but also to “follow the requirements of the law, provisions of the charter and other documents of the company”, as required by Art. 63 JSC Law. \nAA2/1/189\n 184 466 D1-2’s response to this, and to the Bank’s other allegations of breach, is twofold: (1) First, they suggest that the so-called ‘fiduciary’ duties imposed by Art. 63 JSC Law (as well as by Art. 43 of the Law on Banks and Art. 92 CC) were owed by them only when and to the extent that they were discharging their formal duties qua members of the Supervisory Board.418 (2) Second, they contend that they had no knowledge of the Relevant Loans (despite the lending thereunder making up c. 20% of the Bank’s 2014 corporate loan portfolio419) and were never ask"}

The first is incorrect as a matter of Ukrainian law, for the reasons set out at ¶429 above. As discussed there, the (deeply) unattractive consequence of Mr Alyoshin’s argument would be that, despite D1-2 owing duties as officers of the Bank to act in its best interests, they committed no breach of that duty by orchestrating fraud on a grand scale against it ‘behind the scenes’. Such an outcome is consistent neither with Ukrainian law, public policy nor common sense. 468 As for the second, the overwhelming inference from the facts and evidence outlined above is that D1-2 orchestrated the fraudulent scheme which their lieutenants carried into effect on their behalf, and which had at its heart misappropriation of monies through fraudulent sham lending. It does not matter in those circumstances that D1-2 were not themselves asked to provide their personal formal approval of the fraudulent lending: they procured it, the people who did formally approve it were their lieutenants, and they knew it was fraudulent. Further, and in any event, D1-2 owed positive duties, as members of the Supervisory Board, to refrain from delegating the duties reserved to them and to ensure the Bank’s compliance with both its internal documents and Ukrainian legislation.  For lending to occur within the Bank, without the requisite Supervisory Board approval and on terms that could never have been validly authorised anyway, itself constitutes a breach of Art. 63  418  D1Def/¶¶61(4) {A1/8/36}, 61(8) {A1/8/38}; D2Def/¶¶39(3) {A1/18/21}, 39(6) {A1/18/22}; UkJR/¶71 {C5/1/29}; Alyoshin1/¶224 {C2/1/84}; Alyoshin2/¶99ff {C7/1/37}.  419  The Bank had total loans to corporate clients of UAH 118bn as at 31.12.14 {K1/4/60}. The outstanding balances on the Relevant Loans as at 1.9.14 was UAH 7bn and US$1bn (c. UAH 23bn at prevailing FX rates).  420  D1Def/¶¶7(2)(a)-(b) {A1/8/4}, 8(4) {A1/8/7}, 12(2) {A1/8/10}, 61(9)(b) {A1/8/38}, 77(6) {A1/8/44}, D2Def/¶¶25, 27(2) {A1/18/11}, 29 {A1/18/13}, 39(7) {A1/18/23}, 56(5) {A1/18/29}.  \nAA2/1/190\n 185 JSC Law for which D1-2 are liable. 469 D1 further argues that the Relevant Loans or the advances of funds thereunder were somehow in the best interests of the Bank, on the basis that “the Bank derived a commercial benefit from them … The sums drawn down under the Relevant Loan Facilities were repaid with interest”.421 That is a preposterous case, in circumstances where the Relevant Loans were shams, and were never intended to be, and were never in fact, genuinely repaid. (b) Articles 42 and 43 of the Law on Banks 470 As members of the Supervisory Board throughout the relevant period, D1-2 were ‘executives’ of the Bank for the purposes of the Law on Banks. At all material times, D1-2 were therefore required, pursuant to Art. 43 of the Law on Banks {C1/23/6}, inter alia to “act for the benefit of the bank and its clients”, “place the interests of the bank above their own” and “refrain from using their office in their personal interests” when performing their obligations. 471 D1-2 again breached those duties in multiple ways: (i) by causing or procuring the Misappropriation, D1-2 failed to act for the benefit of the Bank, placed their own interests ahead of those of the Bank"}

Steps in the Misappropriation that D1-2 caused or procured after this date – in particular the Bank’s advancement of  421  D1Def/¶77(5) {A1/8/44}. 422  Mr Beketov’s evidence is that when considering whether actions are in the bank’s best interests or contrary to law, it is relevant to take into account whether those actions contravened the rules against risky activity set out in the Law on Banks: Beketov8/¶225ff {C1/1/74}; Beketov9/¶288ff {C6/1/118}.  423  D1Def/¶61(8)(c) {A1/8/38}, ¶80(1A) {A1/8/45}; D2Def/¶39(6) {A1/18/22}, ¶64(3) {A1/18/31}.  \nAA2/1/191\n 186 further illegitimate lending – also give rise to breaches of this provision.424  (c) Article 92 of the Civil Code 474 Pursuant to Art. 92(3) CC, a person who “according to the constitutional documents of the legal entity or the law acts in the name of the legal entity is obligated to act in the interests of the legal entity in good faith and reasonably and not exceed [their] authority” {C1/6/3}. As members of the Bank’s Supervisory Board, D1-2 owed the duties imposed by Art. 92(3) to the Bank.  They failed to “act in the interests” of the Bank “in good faith and reasonably”, and thus breached Art. 92(3), for the same reasons given above. 475 D1-2 again advance the argument that Art. 92(3) should be read to encompass only “decisions, acts or omissions made by a person in the capacity of a representative of a legal entity in respect of their dealings with third parties or corporate decisions that are subsequently put into effect by way of transactions with third parties”.425 For the reasons set out at ¶467 above, this interpretation is unprincipled, inconsistent with Supreme Court authority, and does not represent Ukrainian law. (3) Other issues on unlawfulness 476 D1-2 both rely upon the absence of any finding of criminal conduct by a Ukrainian (criminal) court to suggest that they are “not liable in respect of allegations of ‘Misappropriation’ in the absence of any criminal finding”.426  That argument goes nowhere: see ¶421 above. J2 The second element: harm 477 The Bank suffered harm to its property in the form of economic loss because its funds were misappropriated.

J2 The second element: harm 477 The Bank suffered harm to its property in the form of economic loss because its funds were misappropriated.  The Bank transferred money to the Borrowers under sham loans, in exchange for which it received (if anything) a worthless covenant to repay from a shell company which was being used as a vehicle for fraud.  Aside from some limited value received in the form of the Transferred Assets, the Bank’s loss has not been made good: the Bank has gained no benefit from D1-2 causing the Bank to issue yet more further fraudulent loans to purportedly repay the Relevant Drawdowns. J3 The third element: causation  478 If the Court accepts the Bank’s case that D1-2 orchestrated the Misappropriation, there is a clear causal link – whether framed as a ‘but for’ test or as a test of “direct, necessary and  424  The suggestion in D1Def/¶61(7) {A1/8/38}, ¶80(1B) {A1/8/45} and D2Def/¶39(5) {A1/18/22} that no liability can arise under Art. 42, because the Relevant Loans were all concluded before the provision came into force, is accordingly denied. 425  D1Def/¶61(4) {A1/8/36}; D2Def/¶39(3) {A1/18/21}.  426  D1Def/¶59(3A)-(4) {A1/8/34}; D2Def/¶37 {A1/18/19}.  \nAA2/1/192\n 187 inevitable” – between their unlawful conduct and the loss caused to the Bank.  Although the Bank’s primary case is that it can establish a causal link between its loss and the unlawful conduct of each of D1-2 individually (as they each procured the Misappropriation), to the extent necessary it also relies upon Art. 1190 CC, the effect of which (see ¶436ff above) is that tortfeasors may be jointly and severally liable where their separate actions or omissions, taken together, have caused the claimant to suffer an indivisible harm. 479 Other defences raised by D1-2 as to why their conduct did not cause the Bank loss, viz. that (i) the Relevant Loans have been repaid; and (ii) any loss to the Bank was caused by the NBU,427 are addressed in Sections M (below) and H (above) respectively. J4 The fourth element: fault 480 If unlawfulness, harm and causation are established, then in order to avoid liability arising under Art. 1166 CC, the burden of proof is upon D1-2 to establish that they were not at fault. They cannot possibly show that. If the Bank’s factual case that D1-2 caused or procured the Misappropriation is established, D1-2’s fault is plain. J5 Competition of claims 481 D1-2 both contend that the Bank’s tortious claim against them is barred by reason of the Ukrainian law principle of ‘competition of claims’, and specifically because (i) they had contracts with the Bank in their capacity as Supervisory Board members, which provides the only route by which they may be sued; and (ii) the Bank had contractual claims against the Borrowers in relation to their failure to repay the Relevant Drawdowns, viz. the Relevant Loans, the existence of which is said to preclude any tortious action against third parties.428 For the reasons set out at ¶440ff above, neither point gives rise to a valid defence.    \n 427  See D1Def/¶¶51-55 {A1/8/27}, 60(2)(b) {A1/8/34}, 77(3) {A1/8/43}; D2Def/¶¶5(4) {A1/18/3}, 67-68 {A1/18/31}.  428  D1Def/¶¶60(2)(a) {A1/8/34}, 74, 75-75A {A1/8/43}; D2Def/¶¶44 {A1/18/25}, 53-53A {A1/18/27}.   \nAA2/1/193\n 188 K LIABILITY OF D3-8 482 The Bank pursues claims against D3-8 in tort and unjust enrichment (“UE”). It contends that both causes of action against D3-8 are governed by Ukrainian law. D3-8 accept that the Bank’s claim in tort is subject to Ukrainian law, but argue that the applicable law of the UE claim is Cypriot law.429 In this Section, the Bank introduces (i) its claim against D3-8 in tort; (ii) why the applicable law of its UE claim is Ukrainian law; (iii) its UE claim as a matter of Ukrainian law; and (iv) alternatively, its UE claim as a matter of Cypriot law.

D3-8 accept that the Bank’s claim in tort is subject to Ukrainian law, but argue that the applicable law of the UE claim is Cypriot law.429 In this Section, the Bank introduces (i) its claim against D3-8 in tort; (ii) why the applicable law of its UE claim is Ukrainian law; (iii) its UE claim as a matter of Ukrainian law; and (iv) alternatively, its UE claim as a matter of Cypriot law. K1 Claim in tort  483 The conduct of D3-8 which gives rise to liability comprises their participation in the Misappropriation and subsequent attempts to conceal it, as particularised at POC/¶54 {A1/2/31}. The knowledge and intentions of D1-2 are to be attributed to D3-8: on a common-sense approach (as to which see ¶443ff above), D1-2, as the owners and controllers of D3-8, were ultimately directing and influencing D3-8’s actions. 484 D3-5’s principal defence to the factual case against them is to suggest that they entered into the RSAs as agents for undisclosed principals, pursuant to the (English-law governed) Agency Agreements.430 But those agreements were yet further shams:  (1) The Borrowers, D3-5 and their Alleged Principals were all owned and controlled by D1-2: see Section G above. And the RSAs that D3-5 say they entered into qua agents were shams: see Section F. (2) There was no legitimate commercial reason (and none has been proffered by D3-5) why the Alleged Principals should need or wish to conduct a “worldwide export and import trading business” as undisclosed principals {A1/21/3} {A1/23/3}.  (3) The suggestion is particularly absurd given the purported beneficial ownership of D3-5. For example, the UBO of Hangli (D3’s purported principal) is said to be Trykulych. But Tykulych is also a purported UBO of D3 itself, and so there is the curiosity of Trykuluch’s company (D3) agreeing to act as undisclosed agent for Trkyulych’s company (Hangli). It gets worse. Trykulych is also said to be a UBO of 13 Borrowers, including Ortika, Ribotto, Intorno and Empire {K4-A/29/1}. These four companies all entered into RSAs with D3 {A1/4/1-3}. And so one has the farce of Trykylych’s companies (Ortika, Ribotto, Intorno and Empire) entering into  429 D3-8Def/¶31, 48 {A1/20/20, 26}; Reply/¶19.2 {A1/25/25}. 430 D3-8Def/¶11, 16-18 {A1/20/3, 5-8}.  \nAA2/1/194\n 189 contracts with Trykulych’s company (D3) purportedly acting as undisclosed agent for Trykulych’s company (Hangli). Similar points arise in relation to D4 and D5.431  (4) Then there is the provision in the Agency Agreements providing that the alleged agent “shall not, unless expressly authorised by the Principal …, disclose to any third party that the Agent is acting as agent or nominee for the Principal”.432 That would have made any legitimate business impossible, because any legitimate purchaser of ore/heavy machinery/PET was bound to say to D3-5: ‘You are a company with no financial standing, no offices/website/staff, and no experience in this industry. How on earth do you propose to supply industrial quantities of goods?’. But, of course, there were no such purchasers.  (5) The princely commission to which D3-5 were entitled for assuming liability as undisclosed agents under contracts for the supply of US$4.1bn of commodities (US$1.8bn of commodities in respect of the RSAs and US$2.3bn in respect of the LFSAs) was US$20,000 per quarter.103   (6) There is no explanation as to why, when (on D3-5’s case) the Alleged Principals failed to supply goods or return the Unreturned Prepayments under the RSAs, D3-5 failed to bring claims against them under the indemnities contained in the Agency Agreements.433 A genuine agent would have been bound to have acted in this way, either when sued by the Borrowers in the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings or (at the latest) following the US$1.8bn+ 2014 Ukrainian Judgments/Arbitration Awards. (7) On D3-5’s own case, they paid on the sums they received from the Borrowers as Unreturned Prepayments not only to the Alleged Principals, but also (in "}

So how did they think the Alleged Principals were going to pay for the ore/heavy machinery/PET  431 For example: (i) the UBO of Brimmilton (D4’s purported principal) is said to be Kolobkov between January 2013 and February 2016. Kolobkov is the UBO of 18 Borrowers, including AEF, Elsis Time, Profit and Tamersa {K4-A/15}. These four companies all entered into RSAs with D4 {A1/4/4-5}. And so Kolobkov’s companies (AEF, Elsis Time, Profit and Tamersa) apparently enter into RSAs with D4 as undisclosed agent for Kolobkov’s company (Brimmilton); and (ii) the UBO of Collard (D5’s purported principal) is said to be Ryazantseva. She is a UBO of 5 Borrowers, including Gardera {K4-A/26}. And so here Ryazantseva’s company (Gardera) apparently enters into an RSA with D5 {A1/4/5} as undisclosed agent for Ryazantseva’s company (Collard). 432 {A1/21/5} (¶4.1); {A1/22/4} (¶4.1); {A1/23/5} (¶4.1). 433 See clause 7 of the Alleged Agency Agreements {A1/21/7}{A1/22/6}{A1/23/7}.  434 Thompson1/¶8.4(b) {D1/1/285}. \nAA2/1/195\n 190 that D3-5 had assumed obligations to supply? 435  (8) As explained at ¶172 above: the directors of D3-5 in place at the time of the Misappropriation all resigned within months of the Court of Appeal’s jurisdiction judgment, and before the disclosure deadline; D3-5’s disclosure statements have been caveated into meaninglessness as a result; and D3-5 adduce no witness evidence to support the notion that they were bona fide agents.  (9) The purported ‘instructions’ given by the Alleged Principals to D3-5 are backdated shams.  In summer 2015, D3 and D5’s new accountants, DJC, started asking obvious but difficult questions such as “the rationale behind the setup particularly for Collyer and Teamtrend as to why the client chose to use a UK company to act as undisclosed agent for the purchase & sale of minerals where neither the product, the supplier, nor customer has any connection with the UK” {E11/136/2}. In response, Primecap tried to fool DJC by preparing a raft of backdated instructions from D3 and D5’s Alleged Principals, see e.g. {E11/175.1} (and its 21 unsigned attachments) (24.9.15) and {E11/190} (and its 21 signed attachments) (30.9.15). 485 Against that background, the elements of a tortious claim are satisfied as against D3-8 for essentially the same reasons as they are as against D1-2. In brief outline: 486 Unlawful conduct: The Bank relies on violations of Arts. 3 and 13 CC. 487 Harm: The Bank suffered harm to its property in the form of economic loss because its funds were misappropriated.  The Bank transferred money to the Borrowers under sham loans, in exchange for which it received (if anything) a worthless covenant to repay from a shell company which was being used as a vehicle for fraud.  Aside from some limited value received in the form of the Transferred Assets, the Bank’s loss has not been made good: the Bank has gained no benefit from D1-2 causing the Bank to issue yet more further fraudulent loans to purportedly repay the Relevant Drawdowns. Specific issues as to loss are addressed in Section M below.  488 Causation: The Bank relies on Art. 1190 CC to contend that D3-8 are liable for the entirety of the losses it has suffered. The actions of D3-8, and the actions of D1-2, were all conducted in furtherance of the same dishonest scheme (i.e. the Misappropriation) and with  435  As D3 and D5’s accountants, DJC, note when considering their 2014/"}

On the face of it, HMRC would have a basis for putting forward an argument that Collyer and Teamtrend were not in fact agents at all but were trading in their own names” {E11/136/3}. \nAA2/1/196\n 191 the same aim (i.e. of defrauding the Bank). Even if one leaves Art. 1190 CC aside, D3-8 each caused the Bank harm individually, in executing the particular RSAs and RSA Pledges to which they were a party (which, as described in Section F above, formed an integral part of the Misappropriation).  489 Fault: D3-8 cannot credibly prove (as they must, in light of the presumption of fault discussed at ¶424 above) that they are not at fault.  K2 Unjust enrichment claim: applicable law 490 The Bank contends that its UE claim is governed by Ukrainian law pursuant to (i) Art. 10(1) of Rome II, because the claim “concerns a relationship existing between the parties…such as one arising out of a tort/delict” {M1/3/6}, viz. the Art. 1166 CC claim the Bank pursues against D3-8; and, in any event, (ii) Art. 10(4), because the UE is “manifestly more closely connected” with Ukraine than Cyprus {M1/3/6}. D3-8 contend that Art. 10(1) has no application because there is no valid claim in tort against them: D3-8Def/¶48 {A1/20/26}. However, that is plainly wrong. K3 Unjust enrichment claim: liability under Ukrainian law  491 The elements of a UE claim under Art. 1212 CC {C1/6/13} are that: (i) the defendant is enriched by the acquisition or preservation of property; (ii) that enrichment occurs at the expense of the claimant; and (iii) there are no sufficient legal grounds for the defendant’s enrichment, or those grounds have fallen away: UkrJR/¶75.2 {C5/1/31}.  Its case in outline is as follows: 492 Acquisition of “property”: D3-8 have acquired “property” for the purposes of Art. 1212 CC in the form of the Unreturned Prepayments (being monies held in a bank account): UkrJR/¶77.1 {C5/1/31}. 493 Enrichment: The Unreturned Prepayments constituted an enrichment on the part of D3-8.  The fact that D3-8 may have “almost immediately thereafter”436 transferred those sums to third parties is irrelevant.437 Equally irrelevant is D3-5’s reliance upon their purported role as agents for the Alleged Principals, given that the Alleged Agency Agreements (i) are shams; and (ii) in any event, only purported to transfer beneficial, and not legal, ownership in monies received by D3-5 to the Alleged Principals.438  436  D3-8Def/¶18 {A1/20/8}, ¶19(5) {A1/20/12}, ¶54(2)(b) {A1/20/29}. 437  Beketov8/¶¶246-250 {C1/1/80}; UkrJR/¶78.1 {C5/1/31}. 438  D3-8Def/¶54(2)(a) {A1/20/28}; UkrJR/¶81.2 {C5/1/32}; Nahnybida3/¶176 {C4/1/28}; Beketov9/¶314 {C6/1/127}. \nAA2/1/197\n 192 494 At the Bank’s expense: The Unreturned Prepayments received by D3-8 were funded by the Relevant Drawdowns: see Section F above.  There is, accordingly, a causal link between the Bank’s loss and D3-8’s enrichment.  D3-8’s contrary argument that a UE claim can only arise where there has been a direct transfer of property from a claimant to a defendant is wrong as a matter of Ukrainian law. 439 D3-8’s further contention that “the funds advanced under the Relevant Drawdowns have (directly or indirectly) been returned to the Borrowers and/or the Bank”440 appears to be an adoption of D1’s Use of Funds and Repayment Defences: both should"}

In consequence, D3-8 acquired the Unreturned Prepayments without any valid legal basis: UkrJR/¶88 {C5/1/35}. It is irrelevant that (i) the Bank has not sought declarations that the RSAs (and the Relevant Loans) are invalid; and (ii) the Borrowers (as parties to both sets of purported agreements) have not been joined to the present proceedings.441 Further or alternatively, even if the RSAs are not void, they were entered into with the intention of harming the Bank’s rights. D3-8’s reliance upon these agreements is, as a result, an abuse of rights; such conduct renders D3-8’s enrichment ‘without sufficient legal grounds’.442 496 Parallel claim in tort: The fact that the Bank is additionally pursuing a claim in tort against D3-8 does not preclude the pursuit of its UE claim.443 K4 Alternative unjust enrichment claim: liability under Cypriot Law  497 The Bank’s alternative UE claim as a matter of Cypriot law is brought under ss. 70 and 65 of the Contract Law and as a freestanding UE claim.  In summary: each of D3-8 acquired property in the form of the Unreturned Prepayments.

This campaign was instigated by then-President Petro Poroshenko, and implemented with the assistance of (at least) NBU Governor Valeria Gontareva, Deputy Governor Yakov Smoliy and Deputy Governor Kateryna Rozhkova who directed the actions of the NBU.” 499 D2’s Defence contains a materially identical plea: D2Def/¶12(1){A1/18/4}.  500 These allegations were always legally incoherent, factually baseless and irrelevant to the Bank’s claims; they are not justiciable, and they are comprehensively rebutted by Rozhkova (as we explain above).

Earlier today, five+ years after allegations of political motivation were first made, D1’s solicitors confirmed that: “... there is no need for any submissions to be made in relation to the Political Motivation Allegations because Mr Kolomoisky accepts that the English Court cannot and need not make any findings in relation to those allegations in these proceedings”. 445 But the same letter also confirms that the political motivation allegations are “maintain[ed]” (and there is no suggestion that they be removed from the Ds’ pleadings).  It is entirely unclear how and why the allegations can be maintained in light of the above confirmation, although it may be that D1 still intends to cross-examine the Bank’s witnesses on them and/or to use the trial as an opportunity to air them in public.   501 It is both unfortunate that the allegations were not dropped years ago (the Bank pointed out in its skeleton argument for the 23.6.20 CMC that they were non-justiciable {AA/2/37} (¶67.2)) and inappropriate for them to be “maintain[ed]” in circumstances where the Court is expressly asked not to determine them. L2 Limitation  (1) Overview 502 All of the Defendants allege that the Bank’s claim is time-barred under Ukrainian law,446 because the Bank’s claims (issued on 21.12.17) were brought outside the default three-year limitation period.  The Bank denies that there is any limitation defence. It says that (i) the claim is within the default limitation period, because the Bank should not be attributed with knowledge of the facts and matters giving rise to the claim until a reasonable period after  445  Fieldfisher (31.5.23).  446  D1Def/¶¶84-87 {A1/8/49-50};  D2Def/¶¶45 {A1/18/25}, 54 {A1/18/27}, 62 {A1/18/30}; D3-8Def/¶¶60-65 {A1/20/31-32}.

(2) Ukrainian law of limitation 504 Pursuant to Art. 257 CC {C1/6/8}, the default limitation period for claims under Arts. 1166, 1190 and 1212 is three years: UkrJR/¶99 {C5/1/39}. Art. 261(1) CC stipulates that “[t]he limitation period shall begin to run from the date on which a person became or could have become aware of a violation of his right or of the person who violated such right” {C1/6/8} – it is Mr Beketov’s evidence that the underlined“or” in this provision is applied by the Ukrainian courts as if it read “and” such that a claimant must be aware of the violation of his right and the perpetrator before time starts to run.447 Time begins to run for the purposes of limitation from the date when a claimant had either ‘actual’ or ‘constructive’ knowledge: UkrJR/¶100.1 {C5/1/39}.  505 Ukrainian court practice has not articulated any specific test for such knowledge: “[u]ltimately, the existence of such knowledge will be a question of fact for the court to resolve in view of all the circumstances of the case”.448 However, mere suspicion is unlikely to be sufficient.449  506 Under Art. 267(5) CC, “[i]f a court finds any reasons for missing the limitation period to be valid, any violated right shall be protected” {C1/6/9}.  The court thus has a broad discretion to disapply a limitation period if there are valid reasons for doing so; the key consideration is whether there are objective reasons beyond the claimant’s control that prevented or significantly hindered it from bringing the action in "}

The court thus has a broad discretion to disapply a limitation period if there are valid reasons for doing so; the key consideration is whether there are objective reasons beyond the claimant’s control that prevented or significantly hindered it from bringing the action in time: UkrJR/¶¶103.1, 103.3 {C5/1/40}. 507 Mr Beketov additionally explains that Art. 16(3) CC (pursuant to which the court “may refuse to protect a person’s civil right or interest if that person is in breach of the provisions of paragraphs two to five of Article 13 of the Civil Code [i.e. basic Ukrainian law civil rights]” {C1/6/2}) provides a claimant with a further basis for overcoming a limitation defence.450  (3) The limitation period has not expired 508 There is no dispute that the Relevant Loans, Relevant Drawdowns, RSAs and Unreturned Prepayments were all executed/made before September 2014 (i.e. over three years before 21.12.17 when the Bank issued its claim).  The question is thus when the Bank “became or could have become aware” of the wrongdoing for the purposes of Art. 261(1) CC, which, in turn,  447  Beketov9/¶¶373-378 {C6/1/144}. 448  UkrJR/¶100.3 {C5/1/39}; Beketov8/¶296 {C1/1/95}. 449  Beketov8/¶296 {C1/1/95}; Beketov9/¶¶381-382 {C6/1/146}. 450  Beketov8/¶¶305-306 {C1/1/98}; Beketov9/¶¶384-385{C6/1/147-148}, citing the resolution of the Supreme Court dated 11.11.21 in the Siryus-Bud case (Case No. 910/8428/18 (910/4866/21)). \nAA2/1/201\n 196 depends upon establishing whose knowledge should, or should not, be attributed to it. 509 If (as Mr Beketov contends: see ¶443ff above) attribution is approached under Ukrainian law as an issue of fact to be resolved in a common-sense fashion, the knowledge of D1 and/or D2 – as the owners and controllers of the Bank, and the holders of executive positions within it – is prima facie attributable to it. However, attribution cannot occur on the facts of this case for as long as D1-2 held such a position of control, because D1-2 aimed to (and did) defraud the Bank (see ¶445 above). Accordingly, the Bank contends that it is not to be attributed with knowledge of the fraud prior to its nationalisation in December 2016. 510 The Defendants have (tellingly) not pleaded the identity of the individuals whose knowledge, they contend, is to be attributed to the Bank for the purposes of limitation.451 However, if (in line with Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida’s interpretation of Ukrainian law), the Defendants rely upon the knowledge of the members of the Management Board who implemented the Misappropriation – i.e. Dubilet/Gurieva/Novikov – the same conclusion applies. It is wholly implausible to suppose that they could have possessed knowledge of the relevant facts in a manner sufficient to start time running, but not also have been party to the fraud.   511 Following the Bank’s nationalisation, and as explained in the evidence of Pakhachuk {B1/1} and Oleksiyenko {B1/10}, the Management and Supervisory Boards were replaced: “[we] were, all of us, coming to the Bank with fresh eyes”: Oleksiyenko1/¶10 {B1/10/3}. The board members’ principal focus, in the months following nationalisation, was to investigate, and seek to ensure, the Bank’s liquidity.452 It was only in the summer of 2017 “when our knowledge of the Bank’s historic non-standard practices developed to a point where the Bank’s operations did not comply with the banking best practices and we could see the idea of potential claims against the Former Owners”.453  In consequence, the Management Board resolved to instruct Hogan Lovells to investigate potential claims against D1-2 on 27.7.17, with the Supervisory Board giving its formal approval on 3.8.17.454 Even then, that instruction was simply “to investigate potential claims generally”: Oleksiy"}

There are objective reasons beyond the Bank’s control that prevented or significantly hindered it from pursuing its claim: (i) prior to the Bank’s nationalisation, it was under the ownership and control of D1-2; (ii) throughout this period, other senior managers within the Bank were loyal to D1-2 and involved in implementing the Misappropriation; and (iii) the notion that the Bank would ever have been permitted to investigate or pursue claims against any of the Defendants in these circumstances may be swiftly dismissed. 514 The abuse of rights doctrine provides an additional basis for disapplying the default limitation period.456 The Defendants rely upon a limitation defence to avoid the consequences of their tortious conduct and the obligation, that would otherwise arise, to pay compensation to the Bank. That is an abusive purpose within Art. 13(3) CC in circumstances where the limitation period has only elapsed because (i) D1-2 owned and controlled the Bank for the majority of that period, such that there was no sensible possibility of claims being pursued during this time against either them or their vehicles; and (ii) following nationalisation, the Bank’s ability to investigate the fraud and to place itself in a position to commence these proceedings was hindered by factors for which D1-2 were responsible (e.g. the complexity of the fraud; the destruction, absence and backdating of documentation; and the retained loyalties of Bank employees).457 (5) Disapplication of the limitation period for public policy reasons 515 Pursuant to Art. 26 of Rome II, “[t]he application of a provision of the law of any country specified by this Regulation may be refused only if such application is manifestly incompatible with the public policy (ordre public) of the forum” {M1/3/8}. Insofar as the Court determines that, pursuant to the Ukrainian law of limitation, time started to run prior to the Bank’s nationalisation, that provision should be disapplied pursuant to Art. 26.458  455  Reply/¶23.1A{A1/25/28}; Bank RRFI/¶36 {A2/9/28}. 456  See Bank RRFI/¶39 {A2/9/29}; Beketov9/¶385 {C6/1/148}.  457  Pakhachuk1/¶13ff {B1/1/5}; Oleksiyenko1/¶16ff {B1/10/5}.  458  A precise test for when a provision of foreign law is “manifestly incompatible” with English public policy for the purposes of Art. 26 has yet to be articulated; however, in considering the public policy exception under s. 2(1) of the Foreign Limitation Periods Act 1984 (the “FLPA”) {M1/2/3}, the English Court has said that foreign law should be disapplied only where that law is contrary to a clearly identifiable “fundamental principle of justice”.   \nAA2/1/20"}

The Bank’s arguments on these issues, and the authorities on which it relies, were set out in detail in its skeleton in support of its application to amend the POC {G2/63}, to which the Court is referred.461 If (as the Bank contends) the amendments do not introduce new causes of action, or nevertheless arise out of the same or substantially the same facts as are already in issue, the amendments are prima facie deemed to take effect from 21.12.17.462 In this scenario,  the limitation analysis for the amendments is identical to that discussed in ¶508ff above.463   L3 Venire contra factum proprium and other preclusion allegations 518 D1 has belatedly alleged that the Bank is precluded from contending that any of the Relevant, Intermediary or New Loans is void or voidable, because the Bank (so he alleges) has treated the loans (i) as valid as between itself and the counterparties to those transactions in Ukrainian proceedings between them; and (ii) as having been wholly or partially repaid in its financial statements: D1Def/¶88(1) {A1/8/53}. That defence should be dismissed; no  Pursuant to s. 2(2) FLPA {M1/2/3}, one (non-exhaustive) example of such a contravention is where the application of the foreign law would “cause undue hardship” to one of the parties (which has been interpreted, in the limitation context, as meaning “excessive” hardship over and above that inevitably caused by the application of the foreign LP): Begum (on behalf of Mollah) v Maran (UK) Ltd [2022] 1 All ER (Comm) at [102] per Coulson LJ {M1/29/26}, citing KXL v Murphy [2016] EWHC 3102 (QB) {M1/16}. 459  Consent order dated 8.9.20 (the “Amendment Order”)/¶1 {A6/48}; see POC (amendments in purple) at, in particular, ¶¶16-19A {A1/2/7}. 460  Amendment Order/¶2 {A6/48/1}.  See also D1Def/¶87{A1/8/50}; D2Def/¶54(4) {A1/18/28}.  461  The Bank additionally relies upon Mulaley & Co Ltd v Martlet Homes Ltd [2022] EWCA Civ 32 (decided since it filed its skeleton in support of the application to amend the POC), in particular at [40]: “the court has to compare the essential allegations which are in issue on the original pleadings from those proposed by way of amendment” {M1/26/14}. 462  Amendment Order/¶2(b) {A6/48/2}.  463  If this is wrong, the amendments are deemed to take effect from 14.7.20: Amendment Order/¶26(c) {A6/48/2}.

As Nourse LJ put it in Jyske Bank (Gibralter) Ltd v Spjeldnaes (CA, unreported, 29.7.99), “the suggestion that a bank, which, suspecting or even knowing that its moneys have, with the connivance of the borrowers, been fraudulently misapplied in the guise of a loan, calls it in or takes steps to preserve or enforce its security, thereby curtails its rights to recover its moneys, is absurd.  It is entitled, without risk of nonsuiting itself, to take very step available in order to achieve that end” {M1/7/24}. 520 Second, no reliance can be placed upon the English authorities concerning ‘approbation and reprobation’.  That principle – if it has any relevance at all to a claim governed by Ukrainian law, which it does not – is not concerned with the pursuit of “mutually inconsistent cases against different parties in different proceedings”.464 521 Third, Mr Alyoshin suggests that the findings made by the Ukrainian courts in proceedings between the Bank and two of the New Borrowers would have preclusive effect under Art. 75 of the Ukrainian Code of Commercial Procedure (“CCP”): Alyoshin3/¶¶18-35 {C9.1/1/16}. However, this argument forms no part of D1’s pleaded case, doubtless in recognition of the fact that Art. 75 is a rule of evidence that forms part of Ukrainian procedural law.465 It is therefore irrelevant.   522 Finally, Mr Nahnybida (with whom Mr Alyoshin agrees) also contends that the Bank is precluded from contending that the RSAs which formed the subject of the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings are invalid: UkrJR/¶10 {C5/1/7}. This argument is not only unpleaded, but it again relies on the procedural Art 75 of the CCP.     464  Per Leggatt J in ED&F Man Sugar Ltd v T&L Sugars Ltd [2016] EWHC 272 (Comm) at [14] {M1/18/4}.   465  Beketov9/¶58 {C6/1/24}; Beketov11/¶¶39-42 {C9.2/1/13}. Indeed, Mr Alyoshin himself appears to recognise this point: see Alyoshin3/¶35 {C9.1/1/22}, in which he contends that findings made in the relevant judgments “could not be raised by the court in other proceedings involving the Bank in Ukraine”. \nAA2/1/205\n 200 M CAUSATION AND LOSS M1 Introduction and overview 523 Causation under Ukrainian law is a question of fact.

The experts agree that the Civil Code does not contain any specific test for causation, which is established on a case-by-case basis.466 Accordingly, although the Defendants’ Ukrainian law experts seek to apply various glosses, the Court will approach causation essentially as a matter of fact. As for ‘loss’, Ukrainian tort law has a very wide concept of harm, which includes financial or economic loss.467 Mr Alyoshin accepts that where a defendant commits an unlawful act that involves a deprivation of property (such as a misappropriation), then harm is suffered as soon as the victim is deprived of its property; he further accepts that lending on unfavourable terms will cause harm.468  524 Against that background, the Bank’s factual case as to the loss caused by the Defendants’ unlawful conduct in orchestrating and participating in the Misappropriation is as follows: (1) The Misappropriation caused a series of direct, immediate losses to the Bank in the form of the Relevant Drawdowns. Over the period 1.11.13 to 21.8.14, the Bank suffered harm when it disbursed each of the Relevant Drawdowns, i.e. when it transferred funds to the Borrowers as a result of the fraud.469 The Bank parted with its funds to shell companies with no means of repaying the loans and without any or any adequate security; the loans were shams and (in any event) practically worthless, and were simply the means of misappropriating those sums from the Bank. (2) The total loss caused to the Bank by the Misappropriation increased during the period of the Misappropriation as more Relevant Drawdowns were made. However, it can be quantified (subject to later genuine recoveries) at the point when the active phase of the fraudulent scheme came to a halt i.e. after the last fraudulent Relevant Drawdown on 1.9.14. At that point, the Relevant Drawdowns had caused a loss in the sum of over US$1.9bn. 470 Consistently with this, D1-2’s agents in BOK recorded contemporaneously in the Gurieva Spreadsheet {E18/213P} and Kazantsev  466  UkrJR/¶40 {C5/1/18}.   467  Beketov8/¶¶106-108 {C1/1/35}. 468  Alyoshin1/¶¶26 {C2/1/10}; 172 {C2/1/62}. 469  As explained in Beketov8/¶¶106-108 {C1/1/35}, a transfer of funds to another person is capable of constituting harm to the transferor. 470  Specifically, the total of net Relevant Drawdowns was US$1,951,729,318 and the Unreturned Prepayment total was US$1,911,877,385: see Thompson1/¶7.13 {D1/1/281} and below. \nAA2/1/206\n 201 Spreadsheets {E7/39P} the sum of US$1,911,877,385 as outstanding under the RSAs as at the end of the Misappropriation. (3) The Bank accepts that it should give credit against this sum for genuine recoveries which the Defendants establish have actually reduced the Bank’s loss. However, the purported repayments of Relevant Drawdowns from the Intermediary Drawdowns and New Loans stand to be ignored, because those sources constituted further illegitimate lending, and such purported repayments did not reduce the Bank’s loss. The only substantial source of genuine recovery to date has been the true value of the Transferred Assets actually transferred to and retained by the Bank and which are properly attributable to the Relevant Drawdowns.471 The Bank’s loss is therefore US$1,911,877,385, less subsequent recoveries (which the Bank currently puts at c. US$110m), plus interest. 525 The Defendants advance two main arguments in response, each seeking to contend that the Bank has suffered no or a vastly reduced loss. 526 First, the Repayment Defence. As has already been noted, this is described by D1 as his “primary defence”: D1Def/¶55C {A1/8/30}. D1 contends that the sums outstanding under the Relevant Loans (except for the loans to Tamersa and Prominmet) were validly repaid through ‘cash repayments’, Asset Transfer and New Loans. However, for the reasons set out in Section H above, as a matter of fact, the so-called ‘cash repayments’ were all sourced from further"}

However, for the reasons set out in Section H above, as a matter of fact, the so-called ‘cash repayments’ were all sourced from further fraudulent lending and the New Loans too constituted further fraudulent lending. The Bank’s position is accordingly that purported ‘cash repayments’ (which derived from the Intermediary Drawdowns) and the New Loans do not constitute a genuine recovery for the Bank so as to reduce the Bank’s loss. As for the Asset Transfer, whilst genuinely transferred assets do reduce the Bank’s loss to the extent they are properly attributable to Relevant Drawdowns, the Transferred Assets were grossly overvalued, and the correct reduction is limited and has been taken into account by the Bank. 527 Second, the Use of Funds Defence. This is an alternative argument to the Repayment Defence and is advanced on the basis that “the Bank suffered no loss to the extent that funds advanced were transferred back to the Bank”: D1Def/¶¶56-57 {A1/8/30}. This defence was originally advanced in reliance upon the Lafferty Spreadsheets, which have since been  471  As set out below, the Bank gives credit for certain other recoveries, including (i) FX gains; (ii) repayments made by the New Borrowers on New Loans which in turn had repaid Relevant Loans; (iii) repayments by external sources; and (iv) payments of principal by Dilorsano in respect of the Aircraft. See Thompson2/¶6.7 {D1/347/72}, see too Thompson3/¶¶5.17{D1/440/70}. \nAA2/1/207\n 202 abandoned; it is now based on Mr Davidson’s ‘tracing’ analysis in his first report (even on his own analysis, Mr Davidson was unable to identify what happened to US$557m of the Relevant Drawdowns472). However, D1’s own Ukrainian law expert agrees that the Use of Funds Defence is not available as a matter of principle when quantifying loss.473 Further, the Defence is a re-run of arguments advanced by Mr Davidson in NBT {M1/22}, which were comprehensively rejected by Bryan J, and should equally be rejected here.  M2 The loss at the end of the Misappropriation (1) The loss in principle  528 The Bank suffered harm as a result of the Misappropriation when it disbursed the Relevant Drawdowns, i.e. when it transferred funds to the Borrowers.474 For the purposes of Art. 1166 CC, immediate economic harm occurred to the Bank at the point of each Relevant Drawdown. 529 There is a rather half-hearted, and wholly untenable, attempt by the Defendants (through Mr Alyoshin) to dispute this. Although Mr Alyoshin accepts that where a defendant commits an unlawful act that involves a deprivation of property (such as misappropriation) then harm is suffered as soon as the victim is deprived of its property or the wrongdoer obtains the victim’s property, he argues that the position is somehow different where the misappropriation is performed using the mechanism of a loan agreement. In those circumstances, he says that the victim receives a contractual promise of repayment and so, he contends, harm is only suffered if and when there is a breach of the promise to repay.475 This is wrong. It is an analysis premised on breach of contract, which ignores the fact that (i) the loan agreements in this case were shams intended to misappropriate funds from the Bank, and hence void as a matter of Ukrainian law, such that the Bank did not receive the benefit of any genuine promise in return;476 and/or (ii) in any event, as a matter of fact, a purported contractual promise to repay given by a shell company as part of a fraudulent scheme is in practice worthless.

Mr Alyoshin states that the “only exception” is if the Bank’s position would have been more favourable if the loans were granted on market terms (Alyoshin1/¶26 {C2/1/10-11}) although he does not explain why this “exception” does not apply if the Bank was induced to make a loan to a shell company with no assets or business and without any or any proper security such that the purported promise to repay was factually worthless. 476  Beketov8/¶124 {C1/1/41}. \nAA2/1/208\n 203 under the (purported) loans”: Alyoshin1/¶27 {C2/1/11}.  530 Accordingly, as a matter of both Ukrainian law and of fact, the Bank suffered harm when it parted with its funds under fraudulent loans; that harm was not reduced by the Borrowers’ purported promises to repay the Relevant Loans (or because D3-8 purportedly promised to repay the Unreturned Prepayments, or because the Borrowers purportedly gave security for the loans) because those promises were legally void and/or factually worthless.  (2) Quantification of the loss 531 On the facts of this case, the total amount of the Bank’s loss at the end of the active phase of the Misappropriation reflects both (i) the total amount of the net Relevant Drawdowns and (ii) the total amount of the Unreturned Prepayments to D3-8. That is because the sums misappropriated from the Bank through the Relevant Drawdowns were used to fund the Unreturned Prepayments: they were transactionally linked. It is for this reason that the total loss to the Bank as at the end of the active phase of the Misappropriation can appropriately be calculated by looking at either the net Relevant Drawdowns or at the total of the Unreturned Prepayments which they funded.  The Bank’s expert, Mr Thompson, has done both calculations, and demonstrated that they match, with an immaterial difference of c. 2% between the two measures, which arises primarily due to the need for FX Top-ups.  Specifically, the Unreturned Prepayment total is US$1,911,877,385 and the total of net Relevant Drawdowns is US$1,951,729,318: Thompson1/¶7.13 {D1/1/281}. So as to ensure that it cannot be said to have overstated its loss, the Bank has taken the lower of these figures as its loss (before genuine recoveries). 532 It is important to recognise that this approach to calculation, and the Bank’s conservative pragmatic approach in being prepared to proceed on the basis of the lower of the two figures, does not mean that the Bank’s claim in tort against D1-2 depends upon showing any link between the Relevant Drawdowns and the Unreturned Prepayments. It does not: the loss comprises the Relevant Drawdowns, as stated above. Indeed, D1 appears to accept this, having instructed Mr Davidson that “establishing any link between Relevant Drawdowns and Unreturned Prepayments is not a necessary part of proving the cause of action against [D1]”: Davidson3/¶2.4 {D2/20/17}. Whilst the Bank contends that there were causative/transactional links between the Relevant Drawdowns and the making of the Unreturned Prepayments, and (as a matter of fact) the Relevant Drawdowns and Unreturned Prepayments formed part of the same fraud, proving that link is not a necessary part of the Bank’s t"}

Additional detail on each of these is set out below. (3) Mr Thompson’s expert analysis 534 Mr Thompson confirms, by reference to an analysis of the Bank’s records, that the Bank paid out a total of c. US$2.336bn to Borrowers in the form of Relevant Drawdowns.477 That figure is not in dispute. It is recorded in the first Joint Statement of the parties’ forensic accounting experts at ¶2.2(a): “there were 270 Relevant Drawdowns under 134 Relevant Loans, totalling USD2,335,943,519…”.  Mr Thompson has then calculated the amount of Relevant Drawdowns that ultimately funded repayments of Relevant Drawdowns during the period of the Misappropriation. In doing this, he has used payment references recorded in the Bank’s transactional data to link payments. He concludes that a total of US$384,214,201 was repaid in this way.478 If his methodology is correct,479 his arithmetic is not challenged. Based on these figures, the net total of Relevant Drawdowns, i.e. after allowing for repayments of Relevant Drawdowns by Relevant Drawdowns, is US$1,951,729,318.480 535 Mr Thompson has also verified that the total amount of Unreturned Prepayments was US$1,911,877,385.481 He has confirmed that all of the Unreturned Prepayments were caused by Relevant Drawdowns, i.e. that the Relevant Drawdowns can be followed through transactional links to the Unreturned Prepayments: Thompson1/¶¶3.16-3.17 {D1/1/37}. These parts of his analysis are not disputed: the experts agreed at the first joint meeting that “Relevant Drawdowns are shown in the transactional data as being the source of the Unreturned Prepayments”: AccountancyJR/¶2.2(c) {D4/1/4}. (4) Contemporaneous documents 536 The figure of US$1,911,877,385 is also supported by the contemporaneous documents, including the Kazantsev Spreadsheet and the Gurieva Spreadsheet. The Kazantsev Spreadsheet confirms that the net amount of the prepayments made under the RSAs, but  477  Thompson1/¶¶3.21-3.22 {D1/1/38}. 478  Thompson1/Table 7-3 {D1/1/281}. 479  Mr Davidson advances an alternative figure based on his (alternative) Funds Flow methodology: he says that US$454m of the Relevant Drawdowns ultimately repaid Relevant Drawdowns: Davidson2/App 6 {D2/17/3}.  480  Thompson1/¶¶3.18-3.26 {D1/1/37-39}, 7.13 {D1/1/281}. 481  The figure of US$1,911,877,385 is also equal to the net amount paid by the Borrowers to Suppliers (i.e. the total amount of prepayments, less the returns of such prepayments: Thompson1/¶¶3.27-3.35 {D1/1/41-42}).  \nAA2/1/210\n 205 which remained “repayable”, was US$1,911,877,385 (this appears from the opening rows of the spreadsheet for “01/09/2014”). The Gurieva Spreadsheet, which was prepared “as of today (19/11/2014)”, provides yet further confirmation that (i) there were Unreturned Prepayments in the sum of US$1,911,877,385 (the sum shown in the “Total” row); (ii) the outstanding principal on the Borrowers’ loans stood at UAH 28bn (US$1.8bn);482 and (iii) Gurieva recognised the causal and transactional link between the Unreturned Prepayments and outstanding loans from the Bank to Borrowers. 537 Further, D1’s own case is that, as at 10.9.14, there "}

Those figures have been verified by Mr Thompson {D1/1/116}. Even on D1’s case, therefore, when the active phase of the Misappropriation came to an end, there was an outstanding balance of c. US$1.5bn which represented a loss to the Bank. M3 The Repayment Defence 538 The Defendants contend that the Bank has not suffered a loss to the extent that the Relevant Drawdowns have been repaid. In circumstances where the Bank suffered a loss when its funds were misappropriated, as explained above, it is for the Defendants to demonstrate that the Bank has subsequently made genuine recoveries which have reduced its tortious loss: NBT at [1182]-[1185] {M1/22/367}.483  539 The position in this regard is that by the time of nationalisation, the Relevant Loans had come to be recorded in the Bank’s ledgers as having been repaid by a combination of ‘cash repayment’ (funded in turn by Intermediary Drawdowns), Asset Transfer and New Loans.484 The experts agree on these immediate sources of repayment.485 The experts further agree that the ultimate sources of repayment of the majority of the Relevant Drawdowns were credits deriving from the Asset Transfer and New Loans.486 That is the case whatever methodology is adopted for identifying ultimate sources of repayment.487   482  The Gurieva Spreadsheet records “Principal debt, equiv. in UAH” of UAH 28.8bn (cell E3), roughly US$1.88bn at the prevailing exchange rate on 19.11.14 (UAH1:US$0.0655). As explained below, the total of the Borrowers’ debt including interest and the “indexed commission fee” was recorded as UAH 33bn (US$2.1bn at the prevailing FX rate) {E18/213P}.  483  See also Midco Holdings Ltd v Piper [2004] EWCA Civ 476 at [23]-[24] {M1/10/5}; Cheltenham BC v Laird [2009] EWHC 1253 (QB) at [561] {M1/13/106} (“Where a defendant in a deceit claim, or a negligence claim, contends that the claimant must give credit against its losses for financial benefits which are alleged to have resulted from the tort, the evidential burden rests on the defendant to show that the claimant has received the benefit…”). 484  D1Def/¶15(1)-(3) {A1/8/12}and Schedules 1 {A1/9}, 2 {A1/11} and 3 {A1/13}.  485  AccountancyJR/¶4.1 {D4/1/6}. 486  AccountancyJR/¶4.2 {D4/1/6}; AccountancyJR2/¶¶4.1-4.2. 487  Thompson2/¶4.27 {D1/347/33}; Davidson2/App 6 {D2/17/3}. \nAA2/1/211\n 206 540 The Bank’s case in outline is that (i) repayment by Intermediary Drawdowns and New Loans does not reduce the Bank’s loss, or constitute a genuine recovery, because those sources involved further money being unlawfully extracted from the Bank, such that no credit is to be given for such purported repayments; (ii) whilst the recoveries from the Asset Transfer may in principle reduce the Bank’s loss, to the extent it has received (and retains) something of genuine value, the true value of the assets (and, therefore, the credit) is substantially lower than that contended for by the Defendants; and (iii) for the limited category where the ultimate source cannot be identified (usually because the repayment comes from an account which contains funds which are so mixed as to be incapable of tracing), no credit should be given for such funds because the Defendants cannot show (and the burden is on them) that the Bank has made any genuine recovery which has reduced its loss. 541 In addition to the above, D1’s expert, Mr Davidson has belatedly introduced an argument seeking to reduce "}

That is a thoroughly misconceived and contradictory case as outlined below. (1) The Repayment Defence: wrong in principle  542 The core flaw in the repayment defence is the straightforward point that there was no genuine repayment of the misappropriated funds in the form of external funds being paid back into the Bank.488 Instead, D1-2 unlawfully caused the Bank to grant yet further loans, the proceeds of which were then purportedly used to repay the Relevant Drawdowns. These further loans simply served to conceal the Misappropriation. Accordingly, as a matter of fact, the Bank has not received any genuine benefit or recovery, since it paid out US$1.9bn of its money pursuant to the Misappropriation and has not received anything of real value which would make it whole. The Bank does not hold US$1.9bn in cash; to the contrary, it still has worthless, fraudulent loans on its books. 543 The Defendants’ riposte to this is the remarkable assertion that even if the Intermediary Drawdowns, Intermediary Loans and New Loans are found to be fraudulent, and part of a cover-up of the Misappropriation, they nonetheless amount to a recovery by the Bank which extinguishes liability in respect of the Misappropriation, leaving the Bank only with claims in respect of the later ‘cover-up’ fraud. That is obviously wrong.  544 A victim of a fraud is entitled to full compensation for the loss caused by that fraud irrespective of whatever steps have been taken to cover up the fraud, and without having to  488  Save for a de minimis sum: see further below. \nAA2/1/212\n 207 untangle those steps; the victim is not made whole by the commission of further frauds against it. As Toulson J observed in Komercni Banka AS v Stone & Rolls Ltd [2003] 1 Lloyds Rep 383 at [176] {M1/9/22}, the law does not require the claimant or the Court to unravel a complex web of deliberately opaque dealings, thereby “entering a jungle without a route map”.   545 That is all the more so in a case like the present, which involves an industrial-scale operation to conceal the fraud through the creation of a mass of sham and/or backdated documents and the widespread laundering of monies. Given that background, the process of identifying which subsequent fraudulent loans purportedly repaid which earlier fraudulent loans is extremely difficult, as shown by the hundreds of pages of painstaking analysis contained in Mr Thompson’s appendices.489 To require a victim to identify and claim upon only the latest of the cover-up frauds, rather than an earlier fraud, would simply enable a fraudster to rely on the complexity of his own fraud to defeat or impede claims. And, of course, there would be nothing to stop a fraudster continually recycling loans such that the victim could never effectively bring a claim. 546 As a matter of Ukrainian law, loss is a question of fact. Therefore, the question which the Court must ask is whether the harm done to the Bank when US$1.9bn was misappropriated has, as a matter of fact, been made good. The Court should answer that question having regard to the requirement that the Bank should be compensated in full for the harm it has suffered, as well as the overarching principles of justice, reasonableness and fairness in Art. 3(6) CC.  The answer is clear: the Bank has not received back US$1.9bn in cash or other assets. Instead, it has seen one set "}

The answer is clear: the Bank has not received back US$1.9bn in cash or other assets. Instead, it has seen one set of sham loans replaced with another. This has not remedied the harm to the Bank. 547 Notwithstanding this, the Defendants apparently contend that there is some principle of Ukrainian law which means that if they committed a further fraud under which the sums originally misappropriated were purportedly replaced with further fraudulent loans, the Bank must be treated as having suffered no loss as a result of the original fraud.  The argument appears to be that, because the Relevant Loans have purportedly been repaid as a matter of contract, any (tortious) loss caused by the fraud perpetrated using the Relevant Loans has also been extinguished – even if the purported repayment of the Relevant Loans was itself achieved by further frauds on the Bank and did not in fact result in the Bank making any genuine recovery.  489  Thompson1/App 4-8-1-1 {D1/130} to 4-10-27 {D1/262P}. \nAA2/1/213\n 208 548 The Defendants’ experts do not explain how there can be any such principle of law in circumstances where assessment of harm is a question of fact, and where Ukrainian law requires full compensation for the harm caused. Further, their experts have not identified any case where a defendant has sought even to argue that it can expunge its liability in tort for an earlier fraud by committing a further fraud against the same victim (let alone a case where such an argument is upheld).  The cases to which Mr Alyoshin refers involve only genuine compensation/repayment through valid transactions,490 as distinct from repayment using the proceeds of further void and/or unlawful acts. 549 In contrast, Mr Beketov explains why it is clear that a Ukrainian court would not permit a fraudster to expunge his liability for one fraud by committing a further fraud:  (1) Under Ukrainian law, the loans concluded as part of the subsequent fraud (i.e. the Intermediary and New Loans) are void. A Ukrainian court would not regard such transactions as discharging the liability arising from the previous fraudulent lending: under Art. 216(1) CC, a void transaction has no legal consequences other than those associated with its invalidity. Accordingly, Mr Beketov’s opinion491 is that a court would not permit liability in tort to be expunged through the mechanism of void transactions.492 (2) More generally and in any event, a Ukrainian court would not permit a fraudster to eliminate or reduce his liability to compensate a victim for the harm caused by an earlier fraud through committing another fraud.493 To the contrary, both the earlier and later frauds would be regarded as causing loss in the amount of the funds unlawfully misappropriated on each occasion. Whilst Ukrainian law would not permit the victim to double recover by obtaining compensation in respect of both frauds, there is no rule of Ukrainian law which would oblige the victim to sue in respect of one instance of misappropriation rather than the other. These conclusions  490  See fns 113 and 117 to Alyoshin1/¶¶171-172 {C2/1/61}. 491  Beketov8/¶¶138-139 {C1/1/45}. 492  Mr Alyoshin’s response to Mr Beketov misunderstands the point: he says that a payment is not a transaction and, therefore, cannot be void.  But Mr Beketov’s view does not depend on treating the payment itself (i.e. the mere transfer of money) as void; his opinion is that a Ukrainian court would not permit a void transaction (i.e. loan) to have legal consequences in the form of reducing a person’s liability to pay compensation for a prior tort: Beketov9/¶200(c)"}

Alyoshin1/¶¶24-25 {C2/1/9} and 128-135 {C2/1/47}. 493  As the English Court of Appeal put it in Tuke v Hood [2022] QB 659, at [58]-[59] (Andrews LJ), having regard to “policy considerations”, “… a deliberate wrongdoer is not to be rewarded for the fruits of his own deceit. He is certainly not to be encouraged to prevaricate or to conceal his wrongdoing… [The defendant] tried to conceal his dishonesty, and did his best to impede [the claimant’s] claim. He even went to the additional lengths of attempting to mislead the court by falsifying a document. Such a defendant deserves no sympathy from the court. He should not be rewarded for that behaviour by the reduction of his liability, especially if to do so would result in [the claimant] not receiving the full value of his loss…” {M1/24/20}. The same policy considerations apply with equal force as a matter of Ukrainian law. \nAA2/1/214\n 209 are, as Mr Beketov observes,494 consistent with the requirement for “compensation in full” (under Arts. 22, 1166 and 1192 CC) and the general principles of justice, reasonableness and fairness (as set out in Art. 3(6) CC).  They are also consistent with the position under English law.  550 For these reasons, as a matter of first principle and Ukrainian law, the Repayment Defence (insofar as it relies on Intermediary and New Loans) is wrong in principle: there were no genuine repayments495 and, in any event, purported repayments using further fraudulently obtained sham loans do not reduce the Bank’s loss. 551 For a comparatively small amount of purported repayments, neither Mr Thompson nor Mr Davidson have been able to identify the source of certain ultimate repayments of Relevant Drawdowns. Mr Thompson is unable to identify the ultimate source of US$84.1m in repayments; Mr Davidson US$216m (using the Funds Flow methodology).496 552 As set out above, it is for the Defendants to show that the Bank has made genuine recoveries which should be applied to reduce its prima facie loss. Where the origin of the repayments has not been identified, and given the prolific use of further fraudulent loans to make repayments on the Relevant Loans, the Court should not assume that these untraceable repayments constituted genuine recoveries by the Bank. 553 Lastly, and for completeness, it is appropriate to make brief mention of D2’s forensic accounting expert, Mr Steadman.  He advances an analysis based on the fact that the Bank’s 2016 financial statements record that the New Loans were impaired during the year ended 31.12.16, but without recognising any impairment of the (earlier) Relevant Loans. He therefore opines that the loss claimed in these proceedings is different to the “accounting loss” recognised in the 2016 financial statements as a result of that impairment.497 This point goes nowhere.  The Court is not concerned with “accounting loss”. The presentation of losses and impairments in financial statements are governed by particular and complex rules, which do not govern the assessment of loss as a matter of fact (or Ukrainian law).  The Court is only concerned to make its own assessment, as a matter of fact, as to whether and to what extent the Misappropriation caused harm to the Bank. The 2016 financial statements provide no evidence of that.

Mr Davidson calls these the ‘Relevant Drawdown Portions’, totalling US$1.911bn: Davidson2/¶3.1ff {D2/11/20}. He then contends that US$332m of Relevant Drawdown Portions repaid other Relevant Drawdown Portions500 and that the Bank’s gross loss (which he says is the total of the ‘Relevant Drawdown Portions’) should be reduced by that amount. 555 This is a misconceived and contradictory argument which should be rejected if it is maintained:  (1) As explained above, the Bank’s tort claim is for loss caused to it by the fraudulent Relevant Drawdowns.  It does not claim only for loss arising from “Relevant Drawdown Portions”.  (2) As also explained above, the Bank has calculated this total in two ways, and taken the lower figure.  One way is to calculate total gross Relevant Drawdowns and to deduct the limited repayments to the Bank using the Relevant Drawdowns (i.e. the gross total of US$2.366bn less the US$384m of Relevant Drawdowns which simply repaid Relevant Drawdowns).  The other is to use (as a proxy) the total of the Unreturned Prepayments which is slightly lower at US$1.911 billion.  There is near equivalence between the two, because all of the Relevant Drawdowns which were not used to repay Relevant Drawdowns funded the Unrepaid Prepayments.  The only reason the figures do not match exactly is because of exchange rate fluctuations during the period of the Misappropriation.   But by using the lower total figure in order to be pragmatic and fair as a matter of calculation, the Bank does not somehow confine its claim to loss from “Relevant Drawdown Portions”.   Its claim remains for loss caused by the Relevant Drawdowns.  498  Ernst & Young specifically disclaimed an opinion on those financial statements because they were “unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence about the period this impairment loss relates to” and, in particular, whether it was necessary to amend the figures for the prior year (2015) which are also stated in the accounts.  The financial statements therefore cannot be regarded as satisfactory evidence as to when the Bank’s corporate loan portfolio was impaired. 499  Apparently, having not been instructed to do this work for his first report: Davidson2/¶3.3 {D2/11/20}. 500  Davidson2/¶¶3.28-3.29 {D2/11/28}. \nAA2/1/216\n 211 (3) Mr Davidson’s Relevant Drawdown Portions analysis therefore proceeds on a false premise: the Bank has not limited its claim as he has assumed.

(4) Moreover, Mr Davidson has compounded that error of approach with an illogical muddling of methodologies.  On Mr Davidson’s analysis, the Relevant Drawdown Portions are, by definition, the portion of each Relevant Drawdown that was paid to D3-8 as an Unreturned Prepayment (with the balance being the US$384m of Relevant Drawdowns which simply repaid Relevant Drawdowns). However having identified these sums on that basis, Mr Davidson then purports to claim that US$332m of these Relevant Drawdown Portions were repaid by Relevant Drawdown Portions.501 In doing so, Mr Davidson engages in self-contradiction and impermissible double-deducting: Thompson3/¶4.4ff {D1/440/27}. A sum of money defined as a Relevant Drawdown Portion cannot have been used both to fund an Unreturned Prepayment and to repay another Relevant Drawdown Portion.  (5) Mr Davidson reaches this obviously wrong position because he mixes methodologies: he uses the Bank’s methodology to analyse use of the Relevant Drawdowns to identify the “Relevant Drawdown Portions” and then discards that in favour of a “Funds Flow” approach in order to conduct another analysis of use of the same monies, leading him to the manifestly erroneous position that the same monies were used in two different ways.  M4 The Use of Funds Defence 556 The Defendants’ alternative case (originally advanced in the form of the Lafferty Spreadsheets and more recently through Mr Davidson) is that the Bank has suffered no loss because “the funds advanced during the Relevant Period were transferred back to the Bank”, principally in the form of repayment of other loans taken out by the Borrowers or other companies.502 D1 refers to this as his ‘Use of Funds’ defence. As we explain below: (i) Mr Alyoshin accepts that this defence does not as a matter of principle reduce the Bank’s loss and (ii) the same defence was comprehensively rejected by Bryan J in NBT.  The following sub-sections identify how the Use of Funds Defence was originally put and is now advanced, before explaining why it is wrong in principle.  501  Davidson2/Table 3-6 {D2/11/28}; Thompson3/¶4.7 {D1/440/27}.   502  D1Def/¶¶57-58 {A1/8/30-31}. This case was adopted by D2 in D2Def/¶67(6) {A1/18/32} and D3-8 in D3-8Def/¶66(4) {A1/20/33}. \nAA2/1/217\n 212 (1) The Lafferty Spreadsheets 557 From 2018 to 2022, the Defendants relied upon the Lafferty Spreadsheets. How the Lafferty Spreadsheets were produced is something that has been teased out of D1. Initially, the Lafferty Spreadsheets were said to have been produced on the basis of “the Bank’s transactional data” provided by “former employees and clients of the Bank”: Lafferty2/¶18 {H2/8/5}. When the Bank pointed out that the provision of its transactional data in this way was likely to constitute a criminal offence under Ukrainian law, D1 performed an abrupt volte face and asserted instead that the Lafferty Spreadsheets had been produced on the basis of the relevant companies’ bank statements: Lafferty3/¶53(c) {H2/11/15}. It is extraordinary to suppose that the Lafferty Spreadsheets were prepared from scratch and without any documents which might act as a route-map to the ‘Scheme’ which those spreadsheets supposedly identify. Nevertheless, when D1 was ordered to disclose “all documents used in the process of compiling the Lafferty Spreadsheets” {A6/63/2}, he produced a nil return (save for the already produced hard-copy bank statements). D1 was then ordered to identify the “team” of individuals who had prepared the Lafferty Spreadsheets {A6/79/3}. He revealed that the team was led by Gurieva and included other former BOK and Primecap employees: Lafferty18/¶9 {H2/52/3}. These are the individuals who were “aware of the transaction patterns described below and the companies involved in the Scheme”: Lafferty2/¶20 {H2/8/5}. 55"}

These are the individuals who were “aware of the transaction patterns described below and the companies involved in the Scheme”: Lafferty2/¶20 {H2/8/5}. 558 The Lafferty Spreadsheets sought to demonstrate that all of the monies drawn down by the Borrowers had been returned to the Bank in various convoluted ways.  They were said to show, amongst other things, that (i) “money was often ‘cycled’ through several different Suppliers and Borrowers… often involv[ing] numerous intermediate steps”, involving chains which were “tens or even hundreds of transactions long”; (ii) monies moved between various accounts at the Bank’s branches in Ukraine, Cyprus and its then-associated bank in Latvia; (iii) the payment chains “used a number of different routes to circulate money”, with certain companies “often involved in many such chains in a short period”; and (iv) the payment chains employed so-called ‘Break Points’, “that is, there is a gap in the chain between origin and destination, such that it is not immediately apparent how the chain connects, and the final money repaid to the Bank appears to originate from somewhere else”.503 559 Quite aside from being a near-dictionary definition of money laundering,504 the purported analysis set out in Lafferty Spreadsheets was, as the Bank has maintained throughout, fatally flawed in multiple respects.  Mr Thompson explained in his First Report that the Lafferty  503  Lafferty2/¶¶46{H2/8/12}, 47.1{H2/8/12}, 55 {H2/8/14}, 70 {H2/8/17}, 77.2 {H2/8/18}. 504  As Mr Thompson explains: Thompson1/¶5.35ff {D1/1/159}.  \nAA2/1/218\n 213 Spreadsheets (i) do not follow, or even purport to follow, a consistent methodology or approach; (ii) contain numerous significant inaccuracies and inconsistencies; and (iii) contain significant omissions.505 Neither D1 nor D2’s forensic accountancy expert was able to support the analysis contained in the Lafferty Spreadsheets.  To the contrary, and no doubt because Mr Thompson’s criticisms of those spreadsheets were unanswerable, Mr Davidson remarkably records that he had “not been instructed to address [Mr Thompson’s] analysis” and had “not relied on the Lafferty Spreadsheets”506 even though (i) they were said to have been compiled by the team who were “aware of the transaction patterns described…and the companies involved in the Scheme”507 and (ii) they had by then formed the central plank of D1's case for some four years.  As a result, in March 2022, just three months before the original trial date, and after the Bank (through Mr Thompson) had expended huge time and effort in responding to the Lafferty Spreadsheets, D1 put forward amendments to his Defence unceremoniously abandoning them.508 560 It is striking that D1 has abandoned the Lafferty Spreadsheets in circumstances in which they were said to have been compiled by individuals who were so familiar with the “Scheme” that they could trace funds through apparently unconnected transactions without the need to refer to any roadmap-type documents: Lafferty2/¶21 {H2/8/5}. But having failed to call any of those individuals to give evidence, and in light of Mr Thompson’s expert analysis, the abandonment of the Lafferty Spreadsheets was inevitable.

In particular: (1) Mr Thompson explains that the ‘Exact Matching’ or Funds Flow methodology is “a cash tracing methodology by which cash inflows to an account are matched to cash outflows, either individually or in the aggregate, such that the inflow(s) are traced into the outflow(s) which match the quantum (in USD or UAH) of the inflow”: Thompson1/Glossary {D1/1/8}.

Indeed, Mr Davidson candidly admits that the Funds Flow methodology ignores “what another person may have said about what the funds were used, or were intended to be used, for”: Davidson2/¶5.6 {D2/11/44}. Mr Thompson’s view is that it is not appropriate to ignore the transaction narratives in the circumstances of the present case;510 the issue of what methodology is appropriate is addressed below. (2) Mr Davidson uses his Funds Flow methodology purportedly to trace 84 Relevant Drawdowns totalling US$1.418bn to repayments of loans to the Bank by Borrowers, Intermediary Borrowers and other borrowers.511 However, Mr Davidson then applies a different methodology to trace a further 14 Relevant Drawdowns totalling US$188m to repayments to the Bank.512 In these instances, he eschews a Funds Flow approach and instead says that he “was able to identify a consistent pattern of transactions” in the Bank’s transactional data.513 The pattern Mr Davidson identifies is the cycle of prepayments and returns of prepayments between Borrowers and Suppliers which is consistent with the Bank’s case.514 He uses this pattern of transactions to construct his ‘Bridging Loan Transaction Chains’, by which he purports to trace the US$188m in Relevant Drawdowns to repayments to the Bank. Mr Davidson’s decision to identify certain patterns, but to turn a blind eye to the overarching pattern of the fraud, will be explored in cross-examination. (3) Mr Davidson then uses a combination of Funds Flow and his ‘Bridging Loan’ methodology to trace a further US$118m in Relevant Drawdowns to repayments of loans by Borrowers, Intermediary Borrowers and other borrowers.  562 In total, therefore, Mr Davidson says that he has been able to trace US$1.72bn in Relevant Drawdowns ‘back to the Bank’ (although of those Relevant Drawdowns, US$1.085bn was used for purposes other than repayment of Relevant Loans515). With certain exceptions, Mr Thompson agrees with Mr Davidson’s results if those (inconsistent) tracing methodologies  510  Thompson2/¶3.16 {D1/347/22}. 511  Davidson1A/¶5.67 {D2/1.1/25}, Thompson2/¶5.92(a) {D1/347/68}; AccountancyJR2/¶3.1.1.  512  Thompson2/¶5.92(c) {D1/347/68}; AccountancyJR2/¶3.1.1. 513  Davidson1A/¶5.31-5.32 {D2/1.1/17}. 514  See Davidson1A/¶5.61ff {D2/1.1/24}.

US$557m of Relevant Drawdowns.  (3) The case as formulated by Mr Davidson is misconceived in principle 563 The Use of Funds Defence focuses upon the alleged use of the Relevant Drawdowns for purposes other than repayment of Relevant Drawdowns.  That raises the same issue of principle considered by Bryan J in NBT when rejecting Mr Davidson’s materially identical “deferred losses” and “circular credits” arguments as “misconceived in principle”.  The Bank’s case is that the Use of Funds Defence is flawed in principle for the same reasons. 564 Mr Davidson’s ‘deferred losses’ argument was that NBT’s loss from misappropriation should be reduced where misappropriated monies had been used to make repayments of existing bad debts.  That is (it appears) the argument which he now advances in this case in respect of repayment of other lending to the Borrowers or Intermediary Borrowers (i.e. repayments of loans other than Relevant Loans). In NBT, Bryan J held that (in addition to the bad debts not being pleaded or established on the facts) such deduction was wrong in principle: see [1192]-[1195] {M1/22/370}. He observed, inter alia, that “the Shareholders’ argument involves the acceptance of the proposition that a fraudster could steal from the Bank to repay his own indebtedness and then claim that the Bank has suffered no loss as a result of his theft” (at [1193]).517 565 As a matter of Ukrainian law, the analysis of the Use of Funds Defence is the same as that articulated by Bryan J in NBT – it is misconceived in principle.  None of the Ukrainian law experts has identified any case where a Ukrainian court has held that a claimant’s loss is to be reduced because of the use which the wrongdoer has made of the funds obtained by fraud.  Mr Beketov explains why, reasoning from first principles, such matters do not reduce the Bank’s loss:518 his reasoning is essentially the same as in NBT. Put shortly, a victim is entitled under Ukrainian law to full compensation for the harm caused by the particular tort, i.e. from the misappropriation effected by way of the Relevant Loan. Any (contractual or tortious) liabilities in relation to different loans are separate and distinct (i.e. they are collateral). The liability in tort for misappropriating funds under the Relevant Loan is not remedied or discharged by using those funds to discharge other, separate liabilities arising out of the making of other loans.  Even if it could be shown that the monies extracted from the Bank under the Relevant Drawdowns were ultimately used to fund repayments or  516  Thompson2/¶5.92 {D1/347/68}; AccountancyJR2/¶3.1.1. 517  Insofar as Mr Davidson contends in the present case that misappropriated monies were used to make repayments of good debt, he is relying upon the ‘Circular Credit’ argument that was rejected by Bryan J in NBT as misconceived in principle: see [1197]-[1222] {M1/22/372}. 518  Beketov8/¶¶128-136 {C1/1/42-44} and 140 {C1/1/45}; UkrJR/¶45.1 {C5/1/20}.   \nAA2/1/221\n 216 interest payments under other loans, whether to Borrowers or to others, that is a benefit to those parties (and anyone else who incurred tortious liability in connection with lending to them), not the Bank.

Mr Beketov considers that this conclusion is consistent with the general principles of justice, fairness and reasonableness (Art. 3(1) CC).  In particular, it would be wrong if a fraudster could steal from a bank to repay his own prior indebtedness and then claim to have caused no harm by his fraud: UkrJR/¶45.1{C5/1/20}. 566 D1’s expert, Mr Alyoshin, agrees with Mr Beketov’s conclusion.  In particular, he “… agrees that, in principle, the Bank’s loss caused by non-repayment of Relevant Loans would not be reduced in these circumstances”: UkrJR/¶45.2 {C5/1/20}. Mr Alyoshin expresses a contingent alternative opinion that the use to which the Relevant Loan had been put would need to be “taken into account”: UkrJR/¶45.2 {C5/1/20}.  Mr Alyoshin says that, if the Repayment Defence fails, the fact that the Relevant Drawdowns were used to repay other loans would be relevant if it was shown that the other loans would not otherwise have been repaid: Alyoshin2/¶48 {C7/1/20}. But even if that were the case, the benefit to the Bank would be collateral, with the real benefit accruing to the other borrower whose loan is discharged, along with anyone whose tortious liability in connection with that other borrower’s loan was consequentially discharged. 567 For these reasons the Use of Funds Defence is wrong in principle and should be rejected. (4) The appropriate methodology 568 The Use of Funds Defence primarily relies on Mr Davidson’s Funds Flow methodology, which ignores the payment references in the Bank’s transactional data. The difference between Mr Davidson’s Funds Flow approach and the Bank’s Methodology approach (which takes account of payment references) can be illustrated using the Relevant Drawdowns made by Faboris:519 \n 519  Diagram from Davidson1/App 8-1-044-1 {D2/9/94}.  \nAA2/1/222\n 217  569 To analyse the payments shown in the above diagram, which all took place on the same day (20.12.13), Mr Davidson constructs a 12-stage ‘payment chain’, on the basis that these are payments which can be matched in amount and time. In this way he seeks to match the total of US$51.5m of Relevant Drawdowns made by Faboris to repayments of US$44.5m of Faboris’ other loans and UAH 56m (US$7m) of a loan to Freeline (one of the 193 borrowers). So Mr Davidson says that Relevant Drawdowns (1) and (2) can be matched to Repayments (9), (11) and (12) on the same day, from which he draws the conclusion that the former funded the latter. 570 That approach disregards the payment references in the Bank’s transactional data as to what the payments were for. The payment references reflect the instruction given via BOK on behalf of the account holder (i.e. by one of D1-2’s network of companies) as to the purpose of the payment.  In the above example, they record that: (1) The Relevant Drawdowns (marked “01” and “02”) were drawn down to fund a prepayment to Kalten Trade under contract ST-01/75 dated 9.12.13. The payment of US$51.5m from Faboris to Kalten Trade (marked “03” in the diagram) was a prepayment to Kalten Trade, under contract ST-01/75.  There is then a recorded return of prepayment under the same contract in the same sum of US$51.5m on 4.4.14, but this forms no part of Mr Davidson’s analysis: Thompson1/App 3-2-25-1 {D1/56/1}. (2) The payments of US$44.5m and US$7m from Kalten Trade to Faboris and Freeline (marked “04” and “05” respectively in the diagram) were described as returns of prepayment under different supply agreements, namely ST-01/63 and ST-01/64 \nAA2/1/223\n 218 respectively: Davidson1/App 8-1-044-3 {D2/9/96}. Thus payments 04 and 05 were attributed to the return of earlier prepayments made by Faboris and Freel"}

Thus payments 04 and 05 were attributed to the return of earlier prepayments made by Faboris and Freeline, under supply agreements ST-01/63 and ST-01/64. This was legally significant: the US$ prepayments to Kalten Trade could only be outstanding under a supply agreement for a maximum of 90 days: Beketov8/¶¶361-365{C1/1/121}. By recording the payments 04 and 05 as returns of payments under ST-01/63 and ST-01/64 respectively, D1-2 sought to ensure that Kalten Trade, Freeline and Faboris were not in breach of Ukrainian currency control regulations. (3) Thus, the Bank’s payment references record that the repayments 09,  11 and 12 were funded by the returned prepayments under supply agreements ST-01/63 and ST-01/64 (funded by different drawdowns), and not by Relevant Drawdowns 01 and 02. 571 The difference between the methodologies is that Mr Davidson ignores the contemporaneous records made by the fraudsters as to how they choreographed the payments following Relevant Drawdowns. This is wrong in principle. As Mr Thompson explains (Thompson2/¶¶3.12-3.16 {D1/347/21}), it is conventional in an exercise to follow money to have regard to payment references recording the purpose of payments. That is particularly so in this case for two reasons. First, the payment references were not abstractions, but were required in order to comply with Ukrainian currency control regulations. Second, in a money laundering case, in order to determine how the money launderers intended to, and did, transfer value through the laundering one must look to the contemporaneous evidence as to the “overall purpose and effect” of the interconnected transactions, rather than to any attempted mechanistic analysis of the rapid and complex movements of money, the purpose of which is to hide the true picture. See e.g. Federal Republic of Brazil v Durant [2016] A.C. 297 at [38] (Lord Toulson) {M1/17/16}.  572 Mr Thompson’s approach should therefore be preferred to Mr Davidson’s approach, which (as Mr Davidson concedes) ignores what was said contemporaneously “about what the funds were used, or were intended to be used, for”. Since the factual basis for the Use of Funds Defence depends on Mr Davidson’s analysis, and his analysis uses an erroneous methodology, the Use of Funds Defence fails on the facts as well as being legally untenable.520  520  It should additionally be noted that, insofar as the Use of Funds Defence is premised on the allegation that loans were bad debts, it is for D1 to prove that premise. \nAA2/1/224\n 219 (5) Mr Steadman 573 Mr Steadman does not attempt to follow any of the Relevant Drawdowns, but advances a much higher level analysis which addresses whether there was an increase in the size of the Bank’s loan portfolio in aggregate: Steadman1/¶4.1.4 {D3/1/18}. His contention appears to be that, if the size of the overall loan portfolio does not increase, that could indicate that loans were simply being recycled. Mr Steadman concludes that, looking only at what he calls “Relevant Customers”, the total increase in lending between 31.10.13 and 1.9.14 was US$690.3m, but that US$618.3m in interest accrued over the same period, leading to (what he describes as) “additional borrowing” of US$72m. Mr Steadman then suggests that this analysis could provide “an indication” of a loan recycling scheme: Steadman1/¶4.3.6 {D3/1/21}, ¶4.1.3 {D3/1/18}.  574 This is a thoroughly flawed analysis which is of no utility in assessing to what extent the Relevant Drawdowns have caused loss, even leaving aside the error of principle in the argument that a fraudulent loan taken out as"}

Mr Steadman then suggests that this analysis could provide “an indication” of a loan recycling scheme: Steadman1/¶4.3.6 {D3/1/21}, ¶4.1.3 {D3/1/18}.  574 This is a thoroughly flawed analysis which is of no utility in assessing to what extent the Relevant Drawdowns have caused loss, even leaving aside the error of principle in the argument that a fraudulent loan taken out as part of a loan recycling scheme causes no loss. Mr Steadman’s concept of ‘Relevant Customers’ is arbitrary.  It is neither all clients of the Bank, nor is it limited to all companies involved in the Misappropriation. It appears to encompass a variety of companies, including companies which have no relevance to these proceedings. Analysing the total indebtedness of this (essentially arbitrary) group of companies will not tell the Court anything about the harm caused by the Relevant Drawdowns.  It is not, in any event, appropriate to consider the aggregate indebtedness of a group of companies in isolation, without analysing what has caused the indebtedness of each borrower to increase or decrease, and without differentiating between the borrowing of companies involved in the Misappropriation and other borrowing.521 575 Mr Steadman accepts that his analysis is in any event solely concerned with whether the Relevant Loans caused a loss “from an accounting perspective”: Steadman1/¶4.5.1 {D3/1/23}. However, that is not the question with which the Court is concerned.  Accounting principles provide for particular rules as to when, and in what circumstances, losses can be recognised, made the subject of a provision or referred to in notes.  Further, financial statements are intended to show an entity’s aggregate financial position, rather than analysing the effect of individual transactions or wrongdoing. The question of whether a tort has caused a legally recoverable loss is entirely separate from the question of whether and how a loss is to be  521  In NBT (at [1194]) Bryan J eschewed an analysis which “look[ed] only at the Bank’s net financial position” {M1/22/370}; yet Mr Steadman’s analysis appears to take exactly such an approach.  \nAA2/1/225\n 220 recognised in financial statements governed by accounting conventions. M5 Genuine recoveries: Transferred Assets and other recoveries 576 The Bank accepts that it should give credit for the following categories of recovery:522 (1) The true value of the Transferred Assets which is properly attributable to the Relevant Drawdowns. As explained in Section N (at ¶589ff) below, the credit here is US$89m: Reply/¶28M.1-2 {A1/25/60}. (2) The value of the repayments of principal by Dilorsano in respect of the Aircraft which are properly attributable to the Relevant Loans in the sum of US$12.3m.

Although the Bank accepts that, in theory, it should give credit for further recoveries it makes if it successfully enforces its security against the Aircraft and sells them (Reply/¶28J.2.7 {A1/25/56}), the prospect of that happening – in circumstances in which the Aircraft are all in Ukraine and have not flown since the war – is so remote that the Bank invites the Court to discount it for the purpose of assessing the Bank’s loss in these proceedings.

The table above uses the assets’ values calculated by the Bank’s experts (or the proceeds from any auction sale, if higher); Mr Thompson can provide further calculations using different assumed asset values if the Court so wishes.524  M6 Calculating the loss 579 Accordingly, the mechanics of calculating the Bank’s loss will require the Court to make the following decisions in principle:  580 First, is it relevant when considering whether the Bank’s loss is reduced by purported repayments recorded in the Bank’s books to have regard to (i) the immediate source of the recorded repayment of the Relevant Drawdowns; or (ii) the ultimate sources of repayment? The Bank’s position is that it is essential to consider the ultimate sources, because if a purported repayment is funded by further monies misappropriated from the Bank, there is no true reduction in the Bank’s loss.  581 Second, if the answer to (1) is that one must consider the ultimate sources of repayment, should those ultimate sources be identified by using (i) the Bank’s Methodology (i.e. tracing repayments using supply agreement references where applicable); or (ii) the Alternative Methodology (i.e. Funds Flow)? The Bank’s position is that its methodology is to be preferred. 582 Third, to what extent should credit be given for purported ultimate repayments (i) by New Loans (the Bank says only US$2.3m because the New Loans do not constitute valid repayment so as to reduce the Bank’s loss; the Defendants says c. US$1bn – the New Loans being the cornerstone of the Repayment Defence); (ii) by Asset Transfer (the Bank says c. US$89m, being the true value of the Transferred Assets attributable to the Relevant  524  Thompson1/¶¶7.4-7.11{D1/1/279-280}, Thompson1/¶7.16{D1/1/282}. \nAA2/1/227\n 222 Drawdowns, the Defendants say c. US$683m, being the Credit Value of those assets); (iii) for unidentified sources (the Bank says no credit should be given, the Defendants say it should)?525 The value of the Transferred Assets is addressed in Section N below. 583 Finally, was the Bank’s loss felt in US$, UAH, or a combination of both? And, where a credit is to be applied against the Bank’s loss, is that credit (in US$ or UAH) converted into the currency of loss (US$ or UAH) (i) on the date of the Relevant Drawdown; or (ii) the date of the repayment?

The figures will differ again depending on the Court’s answer on question (5), currency.  526  AccountancyJR2/¶6.1.  \nAA2/1/228\n 223 N ASSET TRANSFER – VALUATION ISSUES  585 As noted above, one of D1’s primary defences (adopted by the other Defendants) is that the outstanding balances of the Relevant Loans were reduced by UAH 1.29bn and US$538m between March and September 2016 by way of the Asset Transfer, leaving outstanding balances on Relevant Loans of approximately UAH 3.1bn and US$352m {A1/11/12}. 586 The Bank accepts that assets were transferred (or purportedly transferred) to it pursuant to the Asset Transfer.  Subject to certain principled exceptions, the Bank also accepts that the quantum of its claim falls to be reduced by that portion of the true value of the assets received by the Bank purportedly in reduction of outstanding balances under Relevant Drawdowns.  The dispute between the parties principally concerns (i) whether the Bank’s claim falls to be reduced by the values attributed to the assets at the time of their transfer (i.e. the Credit Values), even though the experts agree that in aggregate those Credit Values were significantly inflated; and (ii) if not, what that ‘true value’ of the assets is.   587 The Bank’s case is that the Credit Values were significantly and deliberately inflated by D1-2. Furthermore, steps have been taken by or on behalf of D1-2 since the Asset Transfer to prevent the Bank from realising value from some of the assets transferred. As such, any reduction to the Bank’s claim should be limited to the true value of the assets which are properly realisable by the Bank. 588 A high-level summary of the valuation issues that arise in relation to the Asset Transfer is set out below. The parties have agreed to serve written submissions addressing valuation issues sequentially on 11.7.23 and 13.7.23, in advance of the valuation experts’ live evidence.  N1 An important preliminary point: Credit Values 589 The high watermark of D1-2’s case on repayment depends upon showing that RLTAs and ILTAs with Credit Values of US$847m were transferred to the Bank to repay balances on (i) Relevant Loans of US$538m and UAH 1.29bn;527 and (ii) Intermediary Loans of US$123m and UAH 1.27bn. However: 590 D1’s own valuation experts say that the RLTAs and ILTAs were worth c. US$642m, i.e. 25% less than their Credit Values: Thompson2/¶6.18 {D1/347/76}. D1’s forensic accountancy expert calculates that, after apportioning the Transferred Assets to Relevant Drawdowns and adjusting for UAH/US$ conversion and D1’s valuations, the value of repayments  527  Thompson2/¶6.18 {D1/347/76} (see too Thompson1/App 7-2-3 {D1/338P} cell Y433; D1Def/¶41(7)-(8) {A1/8/24}.  \nAA2/1/229\n 224 attributable to the Transferred Assets is US$498m.528 591 The Bank’s experts value the Transferred Assets at US$241m, i.e. c. 80% less than their Credit Values.529 Applying the Bank’s attribution methodology (and excluding Hotel Mir, Hotel Zir"}

US$1.911bn is reduced by US$89m (on the Bank’s case) and US$498m (on D1’s case); and (ii) looking at matters from the other end of the telescope, the Asset Transfer valuation evidence alone shows that the Bank has suffered a loss of US$594m (on the Bank’s case) and US$150m (on D1’s case). These figures are calculated by comparing the Credit Value (i.e. the amount by which the Relevant Drawdowns were ultimately repaid in 2016) with the true value of the assets transferred to the Bank.

The two additional OSFs are valued at Bezant-Assets2/¶2.3 at UAH 18m {D26/1/6}; and at Kaczmarek4/¶200 {D27/1/63}). 540  The difference in US$ terms between the experts’ true values is calculated using the US$ true values or, where an asset was valued in UAH, the US$ equivalent true values set out in Thompson3/App 5-3-3-3 (column AE)  \nAA2/1/231\n 226 N3 Introduction to the Bank’s case (1) The Petrol Stations 596 Although the experts use different valuation methodologies, the primary reason why their valuations differ so substantially is that they use different data for the volume of petrol sold at the Petrol Stations in 2015 and H1 of 2016.541 Mr Kaczmarek uses the volume data provided to two Ukrainian valuation firms (UCE and Veritas) in 2016, while Mr Bezant uses materially lower data from valuation reports produced in 2019, as well as market data cross-checks. The Bank’s position is that there are fundamental problems with Mr Kaczmarek’s reliance on the UCE/Veritas data, such that Mr Bezant’s valuation is to be preferred.   597 First, the UCE / Veritas volume data was artificially inflated within the Bank before being provided to the valuers. By way of example only: (1) In around March 2015, Yuriy Topchy of ‘Oil Ukraine’ provided the Bank with monthly volume data for all of the petrol stations in the Privat group for 2014 and January to February 2015. In June 2016, Chernyshov (BOK) provided monthly volume data for 2015 and H1 2016 to UCE and Veritas, who used it to produce their petrol station valuation reports (the “UCE/Veritas PS Reports”). The Credit Values of 139 of the 246 petrol stations are based on the valuations in these reports, with the remaining 107 being based on the valuations in a report produced by Baker Tilly in May 2016 (the “BT PS Report”).542  (2) Strikingly, however, Chernyshov had inflated Topchy’s monthly volume data by 300% before providing it to UCE and Veritas. The inflation is starkly apparent when comparing two spreadsheets found in the Bank’s pre-nationalisation documents:  (a) The first spreadsheet was created by Chernyshov and dated 19.3.15 (the “Topchy Spreadsheet”) {K2-C/248P}. It shows two sets of monthly fuel volumes for 994 petrol stations for each month of 2014 and January and February 2015: one set labelled “Topchy” and the other “Valuation”.  (b) The second is a spreadsheet dated 2.8.16, which contains monthly fuel  {D1/458P} and 5-3-4-3 (column AE) {D1/459} (except for the US$ equivalent true values of the two OSFs which did not repay Relevant Drawdowns, which are set out at Note (3) to Thompson2/Table 6-2 {D1/347/77}). The US$ equivalent true value in Thompson2 and Thompson3 is calculated using the NBU rate on the date of the transfer of the relevant asset.  541  Mr Bezant (for the Bank) performs a DCF valuation of the petrol stations, while Mr Kaczmarek (for D1) assesses the value of the petrol stations on the basis of a DCF val"}

The US$ equivalent true value in Thompson2 and Thompson3 is calculated using the NBU rate on the date of the transfer of the relevant asset.  541  Mr Bezant (for the Bank) performs a DCF valuation of the petrol stations, while Mr Kaczmarek (for D1) assesses the value of the petrol stations on the basis of a DCF valuation and a market (comparables) valuation, giving a 50% weighting to each valuation. The other main drivers are the different approach to RONIC and CRP: see Kaczmarek2/¶71 {D21/1/29}; Bezant-Assets2/¶6.4 {D26/1/73}.  542  Bezant-Assets1/App 7 (table A7-1) {D19/8/3}. \nAA2/1/232\n 227 volume  data for petrol stations for January 2015 to June 2016 (the “August 2016 Spreadsheet”) {K2-C/249P}. The fuel volumes in this spreadsheet for 2015 exactly match the fuel volume data provided to UCE and Veritas.  (3) A comparison of the fuel volumes for January and February 2015 (i) under the “Topchy” heading in the Topchy Spreadsheet; and (ii) in the August 2016 Spreadsheet, shows that the “Topchy” data was increased by a uniform 300% (i.e. is 4x greater) in the later document. Examples in relation to A-92 fuel for three petrol stations are set out below: \n(4) In other words, BOK employees dealing with the Asset Transfer deliberately manipulated the volume data for the Petrol Stations in order to inflate their values – a conclusion supported by the other evidence of widespread data manipulation and Asset Transfer overvaluation. That was obviously not in the interests of the Bank, but it was very much in the interests of D1-2. 598 Second, the UCE/Veritas volume data is inconsistent with other valuation reports. If the fuel volume data was reliable, the Court would expect the same data to appear in each report. But that is not the case: the volume data provided to Baker Tilly for 243 Petrol Stations was radically different from the volume data provided to UCE and Veritas for the same petrol stations over the same period.543 Mr Bezant gives the following example for one of the  Petrol Stations {D19/1/49} (the figures are for fuel sold in 2015): Fuel type BT PS Report544 UCE/Veritas PS Reports A-92 petrol 240 tonnes 472 tonnes A-95 petrol 355 tonnes 1,197 tonnes Diesel 477 tonnes 300 tonnes  543  See Bezant-Assets1/¶4.19 {D19/1/49}; Bezant-Assets2/¶¶6.11-6.12 {D26/1/74}.  544  That data was used by Baker Tilly to produce a different valuation report, the BTS PS Report. Space does not permit an explanation of how the data provided to Baker Tilly was itself inflated.

As Mr Bezant explains, the volume data used by UCE/Veritas is much higher than: (1) The average fuel sales volumes across all petrol stations in Ukraine in 2015-16.545  (2) The fuel volume data used by the valuers who valued the petrol stations in 2018-19, having conducted field studies of comparable petrol stations (the “Restated PS Reports”).546  (3) Data in Naftogaz’s 2016 annual report for the total fuel volume sold by the 1,021 Privat Group petrol stations (of which the 246 Petrol Stations transferred to the Bank were a subset). The volume data relied on in the BT and UCE PS Reports implies that the c. 243 Petrol Stations transferred to the Bank (around 24% of the 1,021 Privat Group petrol stations) sold essentially all of the fuel sold by all Privat Group petrol stations in 2016.

The volume data relied on in the BT and UCE PS Reports implies that the c. 243 Petrol Stations transferred to the Bank (around 24% of the 1,021 Privat Group petrol stations) sold essentially all of the fuel sold by all Privat Group petrol stations in 2016. That is nonsensical. By contrast, the volume data relied on by Mr Bezant from the Restated PS Reports implies that the same Petrol Stations (representing 24% of the Privat Group total) sold 35% of the fuel sold by that network.547  600 Fourth, the Court should give no weight to the spreadsheets relied on by Mr Kaczmarek. His first report dated 21.2.22 said “I was provided with monthly sales volumes and revenue by fuel type for the Petrol Stations covering the period between January 2015 and June 2016”{D21/1/30} (¶75), {D21/3P}. The documents he identified purport to have been produced by the owner of each Petrol Station and set out the fuel volume by fuel type for 2015 and H1 2016 (the “IK Volume Spreadsheets”).548 Their data matches the fuel volume data provided to UCE and Veritas. Beyond restating that data, however, they provide no further evidence as to its origins or how it was calculated. The thoroughly unsatisfactory way in which these spreadsheets were disclosed has already been discussed above: see ¶189 above.   601 In those circumstances, the Court can have no confidence in the fuel volume data which underpins Mr Kaczmarek’s valuations. The data used by Mr Bezant, which is based on the Restated PS Reports and is consistent with publicly available data, is to be preferred. This  545  Bezant-Assets1/App 10/¶¶A10.15–A10.31 {D19/11/5}; Bezant-Assets2/¶¶6.15(3), 6.18-6.21 {D26/1/75}.  546  Bezant-Assets1/¶¶4.60-4.61, 4.66 {D19/1/62}.  547  Bezant-Assets2/¶¶6.18-6.19 {D26/1/76}. 548  {K2-C/1} to {K2-C/245}. \nAA2/1/234\n 229 accounts for c. UAH 3bn of the difference between the experts.549  602 The remaining c. UAH 3.5bn of disagreement raises classic valuation issues. The two most important are these: (1) RONIC. RONIC stands for the ‘Return on Newly Invested Capital’. It is used to reflect the common-sense proposition that, in the long term (and absent special circumstances), businesses will not achieve returns substantially in excess of the cost of financing. The reason is this: if you can achieve supernormal profits, you will sooner or later face competition (which will drive profits down). The experts agree that this proposition is of general application; but Mr Kaczmarek says that the locations of the petrol stations are so special that they will enable excess returns to be generated for extended periods. Mr Bezant disagrees, observing that there is nothing special in the fuel retail industry, the petrol station locations, or the petrol that they were selling.  See Bezant-KaczmarekJR/¶7.22 {D25/1/45}. (2) Country risk premium. The experts agree that, when producing a DCF model, it is appropriate to discount the valuation by reference to an assessment of the risk attached to investing where the asset is located. But they adopt a very different ‘country risk premium’ for Ukraine: 7.6% (Bezant) and 3.0% (Kaczmarek). Mr Bezant says that he has applied the lowest country risk premium found in various sets of published data; and that Mr Kaczmarek has inappropriately excluded political risk (which includes internal/external conflicts) from his analysis; the annexation of Crimea (before the valuation date) and the Russian invasion show this to be inappropriate. See Bezant-KaczmarekJR/¶6.9 {D25/1/26}. 603 There is a final overarching point.

Yet D1’s valuation expert considers that D1-2’s Petrol Stations were in fact undervalued at the time of their transfer: i.e. they were valued at UAH 6.341bn, when they were really worth UAH 8.444bn (i.e. at a  549  As for Mr Kaczmarek’s market approach (to which he gives a 50% weighting), his transactional analysis is fundamentally flawed (including because he uses an inappropriate simple average of his three main statistics, and relies on transactions that are insufficiently comparable to the petrol stations).  He also fails to adjust for exchange rates between the dates of the transactions or for the different characteristics of individual petrol stations, which results in fundamental flaws in his valuation (e.g., as Mr Bezant puts it, “Mr Kaczmarek’s approach implies that, holding all else constant, a Ukrainian petrol station can be worth over three times more in UAH in 2016 than 2013, despite the economic conditions that would have contributed to the extreme currency depreciation. I do not consider that plausible”: Bezant-Assets2/¶7.35 {D26/1/100}). It is particularly implausible given that average fuel sales across Ukraine declined in 2015 and 2016: Bezant-Assets1/App 10/Figure A10-1 {D19/11/4}. \nAA2/1/235\n 230 discount of 33%). Given everything known about D1-2, this is most unlikely. (2) The OSFs 604 The major issue here is whether the OSFs were operational when they were transferred to the Bank. Mr Kaczmarek values the OSFs on the premise that they were operational, and performs a DCF valuation based on throughput volumes contained in a valuation report prepared by Baker Tilly dated 11.4.16 (the “BT 2016 OSF Report”) {K2-A/4}. Mr Bezant considers that the uncertainty as to whether the OSFs were operational in 2016 makes it inappropriate to perform a DCF valuation; he instead values the OSFs by reference to the values at which a sub-set of the OSFs were sold at auction by the Bank in 2019.  605 There is cogent evidence that all or a significant majority of the OSFs were not operational when transferred to the Bank:  (1) The Credit Values of the OSFs were based on the BT 2016 OSF Report {K2-A/4}. That report proceeds on the basis that 70 of the 74 OSFs were operational, and ascribes a value to their  ‘dispatch’ volumes; i.e. the volume of oil that was allegedly shipped through the OSFs for 11 months of 2015.550 Two spreadsheets found within the Bank indicate that information as to the operational status of the OSFs and their dispatch volumes was altered before being provided by the Bank to Baker Tilly:  (a) The first is the “25.3.15 Spreadsheet” which identified only seven of the 74 OSFs as being operational {K2-C/255P}. The remaining 67 OSFs are identified as being “non-operational” and, in nearly every instance, have no throughput volume ascribed to them over the period January 2014 to February 2015.  (b) Some six months later, the “21.12.15 Spreadsheet” set out data on the OSFs for the later period of March to November 2015. The 21.12.15 Spreadsheet identified only four of the 74 OSFs as being “operational” and having any dispatch volume {K2-C/250P}. The remaining 70 OSFs were described as “non-operational”.551  (2) Baker Tilly noted in the BT 2016 OSF Report that it did not inspect the condition of the OSFs or verify the “data on fuel transfer”, but proceeded on the basis of  550  The BT 2016 OSF Report shows that 68 of the original 72 OSFs pleaded by D1 had positive throughput and four had no throughput: Bezant-Assets2/¶9.11 {D26/1/122}.

(3) On 21.3.16, Baker Tilly queried the data it had been given, evidently concerned that BOK might have provided it with “knowingly false” information. For example, they explained that in a number of cases “… the fuel transhipment volumes significantly exceed the volume of the tank farm (10 to 500 times), which is not technically possible” {K2-F/49}.  (4) Rozhkova’s evidence is that the NBU’s risk management team conducted its own investigation of a sample of the OSFs: “the inspection team had found these facilities in ruins: they clearly had been out of service for many years”: Rozhkova1/¶173 {B1/5/43}. Indeed, the NBU wrote to the Bank on 2.7.16 to complain that its inspection had “… established that a certain number of [OSFs] are non-working for a long period of time (more than twenty tank farms were checked)” {E14/267}.  (5) Later the same day, BOK employees produced a draft response which suggested (absurdly) that the OSFs had suspended operations at the time of the NBU inspections because of disruption caused by the transfers to the Bank, and because “abnormal high air temperature” meant the OSFs only operated at night.  (6) Five days later, on 7.7.16, the NBU raised this issue at a meeting with D1. An NBU slide from that meeting circulated by Dubilet to Novikov and Yatsenko later in the day says this: “Only 7 of the 33 audited oil storage facilities are operational, or 21% (most have not worked for a long period: 5-6 years). They have been overvalued and their valuation does not match their market value as it was based on their businesses functioning” {E14/309.2/1}.  (7) In March 2017, certain of the OSFs were inspected by a number of the Bank’s local branches, which then submitted reports to the Bank’s Head Office.552 Those reports identified at least 50 OSFs that were not operational, and only one that was operating. 553 Indeed, photos of certain OSFs transferred to the Bank included in an make the same point {B3/2/137}:  552  {K2-F/28}, {K2-F/28.1}, {K2-F/28.2}, {K2-F/29}, {K2-F/29.01}, {K2-F/29.1}, {K2-F/29.2}, {K2-F/31}, {K2-F/32}, {K2-F/32.2}, {K2-F/32.3}, {K2-F/33}. 553  There were at least 50 OSFs that were not operational because the report at {K2-F/32.2} indicate that one of the seven OSFs inspected was operating, but does not specify its address.  That report relates to five OSFs that are Transferred Assets and two that are not, such that it is unclear whether the operating OSF was a Transferred Asset.  \nAA2/1/237\n 232  606 Mr Bezant’s view is that, given the doubt (to put it at its lowest) as to the operational status of the OSFs, a DCF valuation is not appropriate. Further, the experts agree that there are no appropriate comparables, such that it is not possible to conduct a reliable market valuation.554 Mr Bezant’s solution is to value the OSFs by (i) calculating the median price per unit capacity at which 23 OSFs were sold at auction in 2019; (ii) applying that price per unit capacity (with a 470% premium) to the capacity of the remaining 51 OSFs as set out in the BT 2016 OSF Report.555 As Mr Bezant accepts, his valuation methodology is not perfect (e.g. it assumes that the OSFs did not change signifi"}

However, his valuation is a product of the limited available information. Further, if he simply valued all of the OSFs sold at auction since 2019 at their auction price then his valuation would be materially lower.556 (3) The Stadium 607 The difference between the experts’ valuation of the Stadium is significant (UAH 1.4bn) and primarily results from the fundamental difference in approach. The Bank’s expert, Mr Thomas, values the Stadium on the basis of an ‘income approach’ – i.e. he performs a DCF valuation – because it is an income generating asset.  608 Curiously, Mr Kaczmarek does not produce his own valuation of the Stadium. Instead, he  554  Bezant-KaczmarekJR/¶8.6 {D25/1/55}. 555  Bezant-Assets1/¶5.58 {D19/1/90}.  556  Bezant-Assets1/¶¶5.72-5.74 {D19/1/95}; Bezant-Assets2/¶A7.3 {D26/9/2}.  \nAA2/1/238\n 233 adopts the value produced by Veritas in 2016 on the basis that it was “validated” by the NBU. The experts agree that they have not seen any analysis which underlies the “validation” process.557 Nevertheless, Mr Kaczmarek says that he is “… satisfied with the valuation techniques used by the valuers in 2016 and [that they] did not identify any glaring errors in the analysis underlying the original Fair Values”.558 Veritas valued the Stadium on the basis of the ‘cost approach’ in the “2016 Stadium Report”. Mr Kaczmarek considers that there is insufficient information available to conduct a valuation based on an income approach, and that there are no appropriate comparables with which to adopt a transactions or market-based approach.  609 Mr Thomas is correct to value the Stadium using the income approach, while Mr Kaczmarek’s reliance on the ‘cost approach’ in the 2016 Stadium Report is inappropriate:  610 First, the Stadium is a specially constructed, income-generating asset, and both experts agree that its highest and best use is as a venue for sports and entertainment. The value of the Stadium “is intrinsically linked to the returns that an owner can generate” from its use in that way.559 By contrast, the cost approach is “normally used when there is either no evidence for transaction prices for similar property or no identifiable actual or notional income stream that would accrue to the owner of the relevant interest”.560 The Stadium has such income streams and should be valued on that basis.  611 Second, Mr Thomas calculates the notional income generated by the Stadium as the basis for his DCF valuation. Mr Kaczmarek criticises Mr Thomas on the basis that “there is not enough data to implement the Income Approach with any reasonable degree of accuracy”.561 The experts agree that “no company specific historical financial or operational data associated with the Stadium has been provided to the experts for preparation of their valuation analyses”.562 But Mr Thomas has explained how he has calculated the Stadium’s notional income, for example through the use of publicly available information on ticket pricing and attendance. And the lack of historic operating data is entirely D1-2’s fault. They owned the Stadium (and FC Dnipro, which played its home matches at the Stadium)563 prior to its transfer to the Bank, so they should have given disclosure of documents relating to its financial performance.

D1 disclosed he was owed US$115m by FC Dnipro {J2/3/120}. In late June 2016, shortly after the Stadium was transferred to the Bank, it was reported in the press that D1 had said that he would no longer support FC Dnipro and it was “likely to be dissolved”.  FC Dnipro entered bankruptcy in in 2018: Thomas1/¶4.16 and fn 75 {D18/1/39}.  \nAA2/1/239\n 234 should not reject a DCF valuation based on notional income streams in circumstances in which D1-2 could have provided the actual data but chose not to do so.  612 Third, one of Mr Kaczmarek’s reasons for preferring the cost approach is that “a willing seller would not find it acceptable to sell the Stadium at a value less than the cost to construct the Stadium (less depreciation if applicable)”.564 But if that is right, it would mean that the market value of an asset can never be less than the costs of construction less depreciation. As Mr Thomas explains (with reference to the International Valuation Standards 2013), the cost approach is “based on the principle that the price a buyer in the market would pay for an asset would be no more than the cost to purchase or construct an equivalent asset, whether by purchase or by construction”.565 So, whilst the cost approach may indicate the upper limit of an asset’s value, Mr Kaczmarek is incorrect to suggest that no seller would sell below this value. It is also common sense that assets – particularly property – often sell for less than what it cost to build them.566  613 Fourth, the 2016 Stadium Report on which Mr Kaczmarek relies contains “glaring errors”, most crucially in its use of a costs manual to calculate depreciation which (i) does so by reference to real estate located in the USA; (ii) uses depreciation data based on “garages, industrials and warehouses” which is inappropriate when valuing a football stadium; and (iii) does not account for economic obsolescence.  614 Fifth, Mr Kaczmarek’s reliance on the NBU having “verified” the value of the Stadium is a red herring. It is true that the NBU required third party valuers to produce valuations of various of the Transferred Assets, and that the 2016 Stadium Report was the product of that process. The NBU appears to have accepted the 2016 Stadium Report in the first instance. But it was sufficiently concerned to require EY to prepare a ‘desktop’ check of Veritas’ work. EY’s report said the following {E16/179/45}: “Depr Arena Stadium. Fair value at initial recognition – 1 517 million UAH Verified by NBU – UAH 1 543 million. From our point of view the value calculation must include the income-based approach, as the cost approach for the stadium does not reflect the property’s market value. As no data about the stadium’s activities (income and costs) was available, we are unable to provide any comments within the framework of this desk review.

Further, the Bank contends that its loss is only reduced by recoveries made in respect of the Aircraft, rather than their market values in August 2016: Reply/¶28J.2.7 {A1/25/56}. 617 Hotel Mir: On 10.6.16, Hotel Mir, which was owned by Ardena LLC and Artis LLC (two companies ultimately owned by D1-2567), was pledged to the Bank by Ardena. Notwithstanding that the Bank had not, at that stage, acquired title to Hotel Mir, its Credit Value was recorded in the Bank’s books and, on 13.6.16, was applied to reduce the debt of AEF on its Relevant Loan.568 D1-2 contend that, in September 2016, the shares in Artis and Ardena were sold to two Belizean companies, Rivage Limited and Sanbian Investment Limited569 (also owned and controlled by D1-2570). After nationalisation, the Bank took steps to foreclose against Hotel Mir and, on 4.8.17, became its registered title-holder.  618 Over two years later, on 8.11.19, AEF brought a claim against the Bank and Ardena (with Artis later joined as a third party) to invalidate the mortgage by which Hotel Mir had been pledged and (later) acquired by the Bank on grounds that Ardena had lacked authority to pledge Artis’ interest in Hotel Mir.571 AEF’s claim failed at first instance but was granted by the Northern Commercial Court of Appeal on 9.7.20,572 following which the Bank’s registered title to Hotel Mir was cancelled and Artis and Ardena re-acquired title. On 28.1.21, the Supreme Court overturned the 9.7.20 decision and ordered a re-trial, but in the meantime  567  D1 RRFI/Annex B {A2/29/1}.  568  D1 RRFI/Annex A (amended) {A2/28/58}; Thompson1/App 4-8-10-1 {D1/153/14}; Thompson1/App 4-8-10-2; Thompson4/App 5-2-7/¶A.30 {D1/509/7}.  569  Fieldfisher (10.1.22, 2nd) {L/33}. 570  Although D1-2 refused to confirm whether they owned Rivage and Sanbian and D2’s position is that he has no documents relating to the sale: Hogan Lovells (21.1.22) {L/35}, {L/36}; Fieldfisher (4.2.22) {L/43}; Ellis1/¶46 {H3/13/17}.

Notwithstanding that the Bank had not, at that stage, acquired title to Hotel Zirka, its Credit Value was recorded in the Bank’s books and, on 6.6.16, was applied to reduce the debt on a number of Relevant, Intermediary and other loans.576 On 13.9.16, the Bank completed foreclosure against Hotel Zirka and became its registered title-holder. Over five years later, on 6.12.21 and 7.12.21, ‘Production and Commercial Firm Golden’ LLC (“Golden”), a 99% subsidiary of LLC Zirka, brought four sets of proceedings against the Bank seeking to invalidate the transfer of Hotel Zirka to the Bank. 577 Golden claims to have acquired Hotel Zirka from LLC Zirka (its parent company) on 9.9.16, shortly before the Bank was registered as Hotel Zirka’s owner.578 Golden’s claims were clearly procured by D1-2 in order to generate a collateral advantage in these proceedings – Golden seeks to invalidate the mortgage by which the Bank acquired title to Hotel Zirka on the basis that the Bank in these English proceedings alleges that the Relevant and Intermediary Loans secured by the pledge of Hotel Zirka are void.579 620 In circumstances in which D1-2 seek to claim credit for the value of Hotel Zirka in these proceedings, the Bank has repeatedly invited them to procure Golden to withdraw the Golden Proceedings:580 D2 says he has instructed Golden to withdraw the proceedings, but the claims are still being pursued and Golden has denied receiving any such instruction.581 D1 has belatedly confirmed that his solicitors have corresponded with Golden, but says that such correspondence was not aimed either at encouraging or discouraging the further  573  Shortly after the Northern Commercial Court of Appeal’s decision of 9.7.20 (i) Rivage and Sanbian sold Artis and Ardena to further D1-2 companies (Kreontas and Petrolynk) {E17/314.4/2} {E17/314.5}  {E17/314.2} {E17/314.3}; and (ii) Artis and Ardena sold Hotel Mir to Prom Export.

The next day, the Bank purported to sell the Aircraft to Dilorsano Consulting Limited (“Dilorsano”) for US$163m. The experts agree that the Aircraft were worth around half that Credit Value/purchase price at most.583 The sale agreements (the “Dilorsano SPAs”584) provided for Dilorsano to pay the purchase price by way of small monthly instalments over 10 years, with a final ‘bullet’ payment of US$104.4m (64% of the purchase price) at the end of the 10-year period. However, they also provided that if Dilorsano defaulted on payment, and the Bank exercised its rights to sell the Aircraft (under the sale agreement or an accompanying pledge {K2-D/7}), Dilorsano would not be liable for any shortfall between the sale proceeds and the outstanding purchase price.  622 Pausing there, this is a remarkably disadvantageous security arrangement for the Bank, and clearly points to it not being an arm’s length deal: it is commercially inevitable that Dilorsano will not pay the final US$104.4m bullet payment and the Bank will be left to enforce its rights against Aircraft which would be worth significantly less than the outstanding sum. In short, the Bank will never recover anything like US$163m. 623 D1-2 were responsible for this charade. The Aircraft were owned by D1-2 companies Goiania and Teide prior to their transfer to Perser (which was used as a conduit for their transfer to the Bank); D1-2 owned and controlled Dilorsano (D1 regularly received Dilorsano’s bank balances and approved payments by Dilorsano by WhatsApp585); the terms of the Dilorsano SPAs were put in place by Primecap; and D1-2 knew that the Aircraft would have little more than scrap value in 10 years’ time (indeed, one of them has already been “cannibalized” for parts: {K2-D/26/5}). Accordingly, the Bank’s loss should only be reduced by reference to the principal sums it has actually received under the Dilorsano SPAs and any net sum it recovers by selling the Aircraft (the latter will be probably be negligible: eight of the Aircraft are currently at airports in Ukraine;586 three have not flown for three  582  Fieldfisher (6.1.23, 4th){L/122/3}; {DAD-A/2/14} at ¶39. 583  Razzhivina1/Table 3 {D13/1/20}; AircraftJR2/¶¶3.1-3.2 {D15/2/6}.  584  {K2-D/14} to {K2-D/22}.  585  {K5-A1/40} see pp. 3, 4, 14, 16, 19, 25 30, 32, 35, 36, 38.  586  In relation to: (i) UR-WRH see {K2-D/24}; (ii) UR-WRI see {K2-D/25}; (iii) UR-GED see {K2-D/27}; (iv) UR-GEC see {K2-D/28}; (v) UR-GEA see {K2-D/29}; (vi) UR-DPB see {K2-D/30}; (vii) UR-DNP see {K2-D/23}; and (viii) UR-DNG see {K2-D/31}and {K2-D/32}. \nAA2/1/243\n 238 years;587 and none has flown since the war started588). The Bank will not be fully compensated if it is required to reduce its loss by reference to the Aircraft’s 2016 value.  N4 Legal issues 624 The main dispute of Ukrainian law is whether the Bank is bound by the Credit Values. D1-2’s primary case is that the Bank is so bound even if the Credit Values were fraudulently inflated; the Bank says it is not so bound. The relevant principles are those concerning voidness of transactions (as to which see ¶446ff above) and the doctrine of VCFP (as to which, see ¶454ff  above). 625 It is common ground that, if the Relevant or Intermediary Loans are invalid, the Mortgages securing those loans are themselves invalid (and in the case of a Mortgage securing multiple loans, the Mortgage will be invalid as to the part securing the invalid loan agreements).589  It is also common ground that, if the Mortgages are invalid, the Bank will not be bound by any values appearing on the face of the Mortgages: Ukr"}

Mr Alyoshin has belatedly suggested that, if a mortgage is invalid only in part, valuations within it nevertheless remain binding: Alyoshin3/¶6 {C9.1/1/5}. However, as Mr Beketov points out, if the mortgage is itself invalid in part, then “any such contractual valuation would not be binding in relation to those secured loan obligations that are invalid”: Beketov11/¶36(a) {C9.2/1/12}.  It follows that prima facie the true value of the assets should be used to quantify the Bank’s loss: Beketov11/¶36 {C9.2/1/12}. There are, however, two further issues:  626 First, Mr Alyoshin says that if the Bank has treated the Mortgages as valid and the Transferors have relied to their detriment on the Bank’s conduct then the VCFP principle may apply to preclude the Bank alleging that the Mortgages are invalid.590 But D1-2 do not plead a case to that effect, nor do they otherwise make any attempt to particularise how the Bank is said to have behaved inconsistently, nor how or when they relied on such behaviour to their detriment (as explained above, VCFP only applies if D1-2, as defendants to these proceedings, have reasonably relied on the Bank’s conduct to their detriment).591 That is  587  In relation to: (i) UR-DNP see {K2-D/23}; (ii) UR-GEC see {K2-D/28} and {K2-D/34}; and (iii) UR-GBD see {K2-D/26} and {K2-D/33}. 588  In relation to: (i) UR-WRH see {K2-D/24}; (ii) UR-WRI see {K2-D/25}; (iii) UR-GBD see {K2-D/26}; (iv) UR-GED see {K2-D/27}; (v) UR-GEC see {K2-D/28}; (vi) UR-GEA see {K2-D/29}; (vii) UR-DPB see {K2-D/30}; (viii) UR-DNP see {K2-D/23}; and (ix) UR-DNG see {K2-D/31} and {K2-D/32}. 589  Pursuant to Art. 3(5) of the Law on Mortgages and Art. 548(2) CC.

But there can be no basis on which D1-2, who owned the vast majority of the Transferred Assets, can simultaneously claim credit for the value of those assets in these proceedings (on the basis that the assets were transferred to the Bank) and claim that they are entitled to restitution of those same assets. Further and in any event, if the court finds that the Mortgages are invalid and that the Bank is obliged to give restitution of those assets to the Transferors, it will inevitably follow that the Bank’s loss in these proceedings cannot be reduced by reference to the value of those assets because, ex hypothesi, "}

US$1.9bn {A1/1/1}{A1/2/36}. By amendments introduced (as an eleventh hour afterthought) at the March 2023 PTR and thereafter, the Defendants now contend that the Bank’s loss was felt in UAH (having never suggested that before, despite having had the Bank’s POC since December 2017).  The only particulars relied on by D1 in support are that: (i) as recorded in the Bank’s financial statements, its “functional” and “presentational” currency is UAH; and (ii) the New Loans were all denominated in UAH and their value impaired in UAH (as recorded in the Bank’s 2016 financial statements): D1Def/¶83G {A1/8/49}. Mr Davidson argues that if the Bank is awarded compensation in US$ “the Bank would be over compensated”, because UAH depreciated by c. 3.7x against US$ in the period since the fraud: Davidson3/¶2.48 {D2/20/29}.  631 The law governing the currency of loss is a matter for the lex causae under Rome II Art. 15(c)-(d) {M1/3/7}.593 Mr Beketov explains that, under Ukrainian law, the court would “be guided in particular by the principle of full compensation” and “assess whether damages awarded in currency A or currency B would be most effective in compensating the claimant in full for the harm caused”.594  O2 The Bank’s position: loss suffered in US$ 632 The Relevant Drawdowns made in 2013-14 were made in US$ and UAH: US$1.5bn and UAH 8.8bn {D1/100/6}. The UAH drawdowns were all converted into US$ (in most cases, within an hour595) so that the Borrowers could make US$ payments out to the Suppliers under the supply agreements as part of the cycle of prepayments and returns of prepayment, all of which took place in US$. It was a fundamental feature of the Misappropriation that it was designed to misappropriate US$, whether the original drawdown was in US$ or UAH:  (1) As explained above, the choreography of the fraud was determined by the foreign exchange regulations in place in Ukraine in 2013-14: payments in US$ could only be made in limited circumstances, and the foreign currency would need to be returned to Ukraine if no goods were supplied within 90 days: Beketov8/¶¶358-381 {C1/1/119}.

That is consistent with the general approach in English law: “damages should be calculate[d] in the currency in which the loss was felt by the plaintiff or ‘most truly expressly his loss’…In ascertaining which this currency is, the court must ask what is the currency payment of which will as nearly as possible compensate the plaintiff in accordance with the principle of restitution, and whether the parties must reasonable to have had this in contemplation”. See The Despina R [1979] AC 685 at 698 per Lord Wilberforce {M1/4/14}. 595  Thompson4/¶3.67 {D1/461/26}; AccountancyJR2/¶5.3(2). \nAA2/1/246\n 241 of US$ prepayments and US$ returns of prepayment which ended with (i) the US$1.91bn in Unreturned Prepayments to D3-8 and (ii) the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings, which were necessary in order to avoid penalties under the relevant Ukrainian laws.  (2) From 1.11.13 to 3.3.14, all of the Relevant Drawdowns were in US$, which meant the money could be forwarded directly by the Borrower to a supplier as a prepayment. Following the Russian invasion of Crimea, however, the prepayments were funded by UAH Relevant Drawdowns (from 19.3.14 to 4.7.14, all of the Relevant Drawdowns were in UAH) which had to be converted into US$.596 For this: (i) the Bank advanced a UAH Relevant Drawdown to a Borrower; (ii) the Borrower sold its UAH to the Bank; (iii) the Bank used the UAH to purchase US$ on the Interbank Foreign Exchange Market of Ukraine; and (iv) the Bank transferred the US$ to the Borrower which used them to make a prepayment. This is apparent from the applications submitted to the NBU for the acquisition of US$ (which record the sale of UAH for the purpose of making a payment under an identified supply agreement597) and from the Bank’s transactional data (which shows the Borrowers using the UAH Relevant Drawdowns for the “purchase of foreign currency”).  (3) Mr Thompson sets out the Bank’s net position in circumstances in which a Borrower (e.g. Dorteks) has drawn down UAH, converted it to US$, and used the US$ to make an Unreturned Prepayment as follows:598  Net position of the Bank, Dorteks and Collyer  Bank’s net position Dorteks’ net position Collyer’s net position Step 1 UAH (460,694,153) UAH 460,694,153 - Step 1a UAH (460,694,153) + UAH 460,694,153 – US$ 33,000,000 = US$ (33,000,000)   UAH 460,694,153 – UAH 460,694,153 + US$ 33,000,000 = US$ 33,000,000 - Step 2 US$ (33,000,000) US$ 33,000,000 – US$ 33,000,000 = 0 0 + US$ 33,000,000 = US$ 33,000,000  596  As noted above, the majority of the UAH Relevant Drawdowns were converted within an hour into US$. For UAH Relevant Drawdowns made in the period 7.2.14 to 1.5.14 there was an NBU requirement that the UAH amount be deposited in an account for 5 operational days before it could be used to purchase US$ (the ‘standstill requirement’). See Reply/¶47.3 {A1/25/77}. 597  See the US$ purchase application at {K7-C/1} to {K7-C/6}.  598  Thompson4/¶3.73 and Table 3-3 {D1/461/29}.  \nAA2/1/247\n 242 (4) As set out in Section F above, the active phase of the Misappropriation came to an end on 1.9.14 when the NBU made it clear that it would start"}

(5) It is no coincidence that Melnyk referred to the Misappropriation as the “Currency Contracts project” {E6/81}{E6/82P} and the Kazantsev Spreadsheet tracked the prepayments/returns of prepayment in US$ {E7/39P}. Indeed, Yatsenko’s abandoned witness statement acknowledged that sham supply agreements were used for the purpose of getting US$ out of Ukraine by circumventing currency controls: Yatsenko1/¶¶37-40 {B2/4/6}. 633 Furthermore, the sham documentation created for the purpose of the Misappropriation gave the impression that the Bank would be able to recover the UAH Relevant Drawdowns from the Borrowers at their US$ value on the date of drawdown. In particular:  (1) The UAH Relevant Loans contained a provision at clause A.10 which required the Borrower to pay, at the time of repaying the loan, an “index commission fee” which (in summary) was calculated as the difference between the US$ value of the loan on drawdown and the UAH value on repayment: in other words, it was a fee to cover any decline in the value of UAH against US$ (see e.g. AEF’s UAH loan at {F2/38}). (2) The Gurieva Spreadsheet shows that, as a result of the decline of UAH against US$, there was a “difference between the principal of the loan today [19.11.14] and the prepayment amount [sc. the Unreturned Prepayments], UAH equiv.” of UAH 5.1bn (column AF). But that difference was nearly matched by the “index commission fee” due on the loans of UAH 4.9bn (column O) {E18/213P}. The Gurieva Spreadsheet shows that, had the Borrowers repaid the principal and indexation fees, the Bank would have received, in UAH, the original US$ value of their drawdowns. The reason this did not happen is that in 2015 the Bank amended the Relevant Loans to ‘cap’ the indexation fee:600 that was undoubtedly in D1-2’s interests (because it meant that the Borrowers’ liability to the Bank was no longer pegged to the US$) but it was clearly not in the Bank’s interest. (3) As set out at ¶244 above, each RSA Pledge was accompanied by an assignment agreement by which the Bank could take an assignment of the Borrower’s rights  599  NBU Resolution 540 {E4/366/4} (¶1(12)). 600  See e.g. {E10/32}, {E10/37}, {E10/49} {E10/76}, {E10/80}, {E10/87}, {E10/106}. \nAA2/1/248\n 243 against D3-8 if the Borrower defaulted on its loan. The Bank could therefore have taken an assignment of the Borrowers’ rights against D3-8 (including the Borrowers’ choses in action arising from the 2014 Ukrainian Judgments) which would have made the Bank a creditor of D3-8 in the sum of US$1.91bn. But it never did, and the assignment agreements were terminated in mid-2015 (again, this was in the interests of D1-2 but not the Bank).  634 Accordingly, the Bank will only be fully compensated for the loss it has suffered if it is compensated in US$. Where the Relevant Drawdown was made in US$ and was not validly repaid, as a matter of common sense the Bank suffered a direct loss in US$. Where the Relevant Drawdown was made in UAH, the UAH drawdown was converted to US$ for the purpose of the Misappropriation and the effect is that the Bank suffered a US$ loss. That loss is rightly quantified as the US$ value of the UAH Relevant Drawdowns converted using the exchange rate applicable on the date of drawdown.

That loss is rightly quantified as the US$ value of the UAH Relevant Drawdowns converted using the exchange rate applicable on the date of drawdown.  O3 The Defendants’ position: loss in UAH 635 The two particulars of the Defendants’ case that the Bank’s loss was suffered in UAH do not withstand scrutiny.  636 First, the fact that the Bank’s “functional” and “presentational” currency is UAH601 does not mean the Bank’s loss was suffered in UAH. As Mr Thompson explains, the Bank’s assets and liabilities were denominated in US$, UAH and other currencies, but converted to UAH at the prevailing exchange rate at the end of the accounting period for the purpose of presenting its accounts.602 He also explains that the Bank’s financial statements (and the changes in its corporate loan book) do not imply that the risk associated with US$ lending was carried in UAH,603 nor is there any basis for Mr Davidson’s suggestion that the Bank had only “relatively minor” exposure to US$ liabilities or currency risk.604  Mr Davidson asserts that the “Bank accounts for, reports and carries the value of transactions, including those originating in USD, in UAH…”: Davidson3/¶2.46 {D2/20/29}. That is plainly wrong: the Bank accounts for and carries the value of transactions in US$, UAH and other currencies, but reports them in UAH in its financial statements: Thompson4/¶¶3.54-.3.56 {D1/461/23}. The distinction is fatal to Ds’ reliance on the Bank’s financial statements as a basis for the contention that  601  D1Def/¶83G(1){A1/8/49}. 602  Thompson4/¶¶3.16-3.37 {D1/461/13}, and see e.g. the Bank’s 2015 financial statements at {K1/5/70}. 603  Thompson4/¶3.40-3.43 {D1/461/18}. 604  Davidson3/¶2.4(5) {D2/20/26}; Thompson4/¶¶3.43-3.49 {D1/461/19}. Dubilet informed the NBU that, as at 16.7.14, the Bank had customer deposit balances of US$2.9bn and a further US$1bn in retail / corporate deposit accounts {E4/255}. \nAA2/1/249\n 244 the Bank’s loss was suffered solely in UAH.605 637 Second, the fact that the New Loans were denominated in UAH and impaired in UAH in the Bank’s 2016 financial statements does not mean the Bank suffered a loss in 2013-14 in UAH: D1Def/¶83G(2) {A1/8/49}. The Bank’s case is that New Loans were further fraudulent transactions procured by D1-2 to conceal the Misappropriation; the Bank does not claim for losses arising from the New Loans – its claim is for the losses caused by the Misappropriation, i.e. those caused by the Relevant Loans / Drawdowns.  The currency of the New Loans or impairments in financial statements related to them is irrelevant to the determination of the currency in which the Bank suffered the loss in 2013-14. Indeed, the purported repayment of US$ drawdowns using UAH New Loans in 2016 amply demonstrates that the earlier and underlying loss was one felt in US$:  (1) D1 accepts that there were outstanding balances under US$ Relevant Loans of US$424m prior to the Transformation {A1/13/3}. In order to effect repayment of those US$ balances, the UAH drawn down under the New Loans had to be converted into US$ at the rate on the date of repayment (i.e. October-November 2016): Thompson4/¶3.52 {D1/461/22}. As a result of the depreciation of UAH in the period between the dates on which the Relevant Loans were made (2013-14) and the Transformation, ‘more’ UAH were needed to pay off a US$ loan in 2016 than would have been the case in 2013-14.  (2) To take a simple example, Uniks’ outstanding US$27m Relevant Loan was repaid with UAH 698m of Like City’s New Loan (i.e. at an FX rate of 1:25): Thompson1/App 4-8-20-2 {D1/178P}. If the same Relevant Loan had been repaid with UAH on 1.9.14 (i.e. at an FX rate of 1:12) it would have required only UAH 326m.  (3) The "}

(3) The Transformation shows that the Bank’s loss caused by the US$ Relevant Drawdowns was a US$ loss which had to be repaid in US$. And, where the source of the purported repayment was UAH, the UAH had to be converted to US$ on the date of repayment before the repayment could be made.  (4) The same is true of the Asset Transfer. UAH-denominated assets were used purportedly to repay outstanding US$ loans. To effect repayment, the UAH asset  605  As a matter of English law (and as a matter of common sense) a claimant does not always suffer a loss in the currency in which it presents its accounts. See Kazakhstan Kagazy v Zhunus [2018] EWHC 369 (Comm) at [52] {M1/19/20}. \nAA2/1/250\n 245 had to be converted to US$ at the exchange rate on the date the asset was transferred to the Bank before being credited against the outstanding loan US$ loan balance: D1 RRFI/¶7, fn 2 {A2/27/3}. Those UAH assets were worth less, in US$ terms, in 2016 than they would have been had they been transferred to the Bank in 2013-14. Nevertheless, the Bank’s outstanding loans were denominated in US$ and the purported repayments had to be in US$.  638 The Defendants’ case also – counterintuintively – results in the majority (by value) of Relevant Drawdowns being converted from US$ (in which they were drawdown) to UAH.  O4 The Defendants’ position on applicable exchange rates: alleged ‘artificial’ loss 639 The Bank calculates its US$ loss by converting UAH Relevant Drawdowns into US$, applying the exchange rate at the drawdown date. When those UAH drawdowns are repaid by UAH-denominated assets or loans in 2016, the Bank converts the UAH repayments into US$ at the (depreciated) 2016 rate before being credited against the 2014 drawdowns. Importantly, the Bank’s approach reflects exactly what happened: (i) as set out above, UAH Relevant Drawdowns were converted into US$ on (or very shortly after) the date of drawdown and (ii) UAH repayments were converted into US$ on the date of repayment to repay US$ Relevant Drawdowns.606 640 The Defendants say that the Bank’s approach gives rise to an “artificial loss”: D1Def/¶83E {A1/8/48}. To take a simple example: if a UAH 100m drawdown is made in 2013 and was exchanged by the Bank into US$12.5m in 2013 (at the prevailing rate, c. 8:1), when it is repaid by a UAH 100m asset in 2016 that asset is converted (at 2016 rates, c. 27:1) so it only repays US$3.7m of the Bank’s US$ denominated loss. D1 says this is artificial because, if the drawdown and repayment are all addressed in UAH, the asset should reduce the loss to nil: Davidson3/¶¶3.84-3.102 {D2/20/52}. This is a superficial and misguided argument. It ignores the fact that there is a time lapse between fraudulent UAH drawdown and purported (ultimate) repayment, and the context of a local currency generally depreciating against the US$.  If the Court finds that the Bank suffered a US$1.9bn loss in 2013-14 then there is nothing ‘artificial’ about the fact that the UAH-denominated repayments made in 2016 did not cover the entirety of that loss. 641 Furthermore, and as Mr Thompson explains, whatever approach is taken to the exchange  606  See D1Def/83E {A1/8/48}, Thompson4/¶¶4.44-4.46 {D1/461/48}.

O5 The Bank’s alternative case: loss in UAH and US$ 643 If the Bank’s loss was not suffered entirely in US$, the Bank’s alternative case is that it suffered a loss in a combination of UAH and US$ according to the currency of the original drawdown. Even Mr Davidson can see the force in that position: “I can also see a case for the claim…being denominated in a combination of UAH and USD, keeping each transaction in the currency in which it was originally transacted”: Davidson3/¶2.45 {D2/20/28}. Mr Thompson’s loss matrix sets out how the Bank’s loss would be calculated on a mixed currency approach {D1/474P}. If a mixed currency approach is adopted, the only sensible starting point for calculating the Bank’s loss is the sum of the Relevant Drawdowns less repayment by Relevant Drawdowns, in original drawdown currency i.e. UAH 6.2bn and US$1.397bn. Credits for the Transferred Assets should then be applied against the UAH and US$ drawdowns respectively.    607  The only exception is where the loss is denominated in the currency of the original drawdown and direct repayments (as opposed to ultimate sources of repayment) are treated as valid reductions of the Bank’s loss. See Thompson4 App 4-2 {D1/474P}. 608  To take a simple example: a Borrower draws down US$10m on 1.9.14 (equivalent to UAH 131m) which is repaid in 2016 with assets, at that point, in order to repay the US$10m loan, a total of UAH 248m is required. If the Bank’s loss is calculated by converting the US$ drawdown into UAH on the date of drawdown, it generates an apparent over repayment of UAH 117m (UAH 248m – UAH 131m). Thompson4/¶¶4.66-4.72 {D1/461/52}. The same mismatches arise even where the Relevant Drawdown and the ultimate source of repayment are denominated in the same currency, if the Relevant Drawdown has been the subject of intermediary repayments in a different currency: see Thompson4/¶4.71 and fn 131 {D1/461/54}.  609  Davidson3/¶3.90 {D2/20/53}. 610  So if a US$100m loan was repaid in 2016 with a UAH 2,400m asset (when the UAH/US$ FX rate was 24:1), Mr Davidson would convert that asset into US$ at the 2014 rate (8:1), such that its dollar value is treated as US$300m, even though the asset was actually worth only US$100m at the time it was transferred.

In the further alternative, the Bank claims pre-judgment simple interest (i) as damages; alternatively (ii) in Ukrainian law under Art. 625 CC; alternatively (iii) under s. 35A of the Senior Courts Act (“SCA”) 1981. 645 The calculation of interest is likely to be complex and will depend upon (i) the principal sum in damages awarded and the currency in which it is awarded; (ii) the rate awarded; (iii) the date(s) from which interest should run; and (iv) (if interest is compounded) the appropriate rest periods. These matters are addressed, as issues of principle, below: further calculations will be required before any judgment is entered that cannot presently be conducted given the uncertainties described above. P2 Compound interest 646 As Foxton J has noted, “compound interest reflects the commercial value of money – it is both the cost paid by those having to borrow it, and the return expected by those investing or saving it, whether they are trading entities or not”.611 It appears to be common ground612 that the Court has the power to award such interest in equity in light of a defendant’s fraud if such a power exists as a matter of Ukrainian law.613 The question for the Court is therefore whether, as a matter of Ukrainian law, the Bank can recover compound interest as damages for its loss. The Defendants’ experts say that there is no power to award compound interest as damages;614 Mr Beketov says that there is. 647 Mr Beketov’s view is to be preferred. Briefly: (i) an award of compound interest as damages would reflect the principle of full compensation615 and be analogous with the compensatory nature of interest and inflation-linked losses payable under Art. 625 CC; (ii) Mr Alyoshin accepts that a claimant can claim loss of profits under Arts. 22 and 1166 CC provided it can prove those losses,616 but he does not explain why a claimant cannot claim a loss represented  611  Hotel Portfolio ll UK Ltd (In Liquidation) v Ruhan [2022] EWHC 1695 (Comm) at [42] {M1/27/14}. See also Kuwait Oil Tanker v Al Bader (No 3) [2000] 2 All ER (Comm) 271 at [210], where Nourse LJ explained compound interest as justified on a similar basis, viz.  it ensures “full compensation where the wrongdoer deprives a person or company of monies employed in trading operations” {M1/8/74}. 612  See POC/¶63A {A1/2/35}; D1Def/¶83B {A1/8/48}; D2Def/¶70A {A1/18/33}; D3-8Def/¶68(3) {A1/20/34}. 613  Kazakstan Kagazy at [96] {M1/19/40}, [108] {M1/19/44} (per Picken J).  614  Alyoshin1/¶310 {C2/1/114}; Alyoshin2/¶¶256, 322-329 {C7/1/104-106}; Nahnybida3/¶¶272-273 {C4/1/52}; Nahnybida4/¶147 {C9/1/32}.  615  Beketov9/¶434 {C6/1/164}. 616  Alyoshin2/¶¶324-329 {C7/1/104-106}. \nAA2/1/253\n 248 by additional borrowing at compound rates; and (iii) Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida’s view that there is no entitlement to compound interest as damages and no ability to award pre-judgment simple interest (see below) would suggest a strikingly unjust lacuna in Ukrainian law which is inconsistent with the full compensation principle. In the absence of any provision of Ukrainian law prohibiting compound interest, the better view is that it may be awarded to provide full compensation. 648 If compound interest may be awarded in Ukrainian law, the Bank must show that it has suffered such a loss as a result of the Defendants’ conduct, but that it may rely on the circumstances of the case including the undisputed and obvious facts as to the nature of its business.617 The Bank’s position is that, as a result of the Misappropriation, it was required to finance US$1.9bn (or its UAH equivalent) on compound interest terms to plug the hole in its balance sheet.

The Bank’s core business (as with any retail bank) involved using funds from depositors and others to lend to customers (mainly D1-2 companies). Substantially all of the Bank’s financing was undertaken on a compound interest basis because it required the Bank to pay monthly interest to the depositor/lender. In particular:  (1) The Bank’s main source of financing in the period 2013 onwards was customer deposits denominated in UAH and US$, in respect of which the Bank paid interest on a monthly (and necessarily compound) basis;618 and  (2) The Bank’s other primary source of funding was lending from the NBU. Around the period in which the UAH Relevant Drawdowns were made totalling UAH 8.8bn (3.4.14 to 1.9.14), the Bank entered into loan facilities with the NBU with a face value of UAH 10bn {E3/172.1} {E3/172.2}. And between 31.12.13 and 31.12.15, its total borrowing from the NBU increased from UAH 3.4bn (31.12.13) {K1/4/5} to UAH 18.3bn (31.12.14) (ibid.) to UAH 27bn (31.12.15) {K1/5/5}. All of the NBU loans provided for interest to be paid monthly (and necessarily on a compound basis) until maturity. 649 The Bank claims compound interest as damages in Ukrainian law (or under the English  617  As a matter of English law, “the question of what evidence is required from which a court can infer that a plaintiff has suffered a financial loss in the form of the incurring of borrowing costs will depend on the circumstances of the particular case”: Sagicor Bank Jamaica v YP Seaton [2022] UKPC 48 at [33] {M1/25/17}.  618  See customer accounts terms at {E1/172.3},{E1/239.2.2},{E3/26.1},{E4/324.1},{E11/129.1},{E12/21.1}, {E12/224.1},{E17/150.3}.  \nAA2/1/254\n 249 court’s equitable jurisdiction619) whether its damages are awarded in US$ or UAH as follows: 650 Dates: the Bank’s loss was suffered on the date of each Relevant Drawdown and the Bank’s interest loss likewise runs from each of those drawdowns, less genuine recoveries received. 651 Rates: the Bank’s primary case is that the appropriate rate is 10.875%, being the rate at which the Bank borrowed US$ under participation notes issues in 2013 (POC/¶64(a) {A1/2/35}, {E1/255/3}). Alternatively, the rate should be the rate payable by the Bank on its most expensive US$ or UAH borrowing, the rate payable on the NBU loans, or its weighted average cost of US$ and/or UAH borrowing: Reply/¶¶52-54 {A1/25/79}. The calculation for the Bank’s most expensive and weighted average cost of borrowing in US$ and UAH are summarised in Reply/Annex H {A1/33}. Where those rates fell below 3% p.a., the Bank’s claim is for interest at 3% p.a. as a presumed rate of return which the Bank would have made on the misappropriated funds. 652 Rests: substantially all of the Bank’s borrowing required the Bank to pay interest on a monthly basis. The Bank therefore claims compound interest with monthly rests. P3 Simple interest  653 Simple interest as damages. If the Court finds that the Bank did not suffer a compound interest loss, the Bank will contend in the alternative that it suffered a simple interest loss (in US$ and/or UAH) from the dates and at the rates outlined above: Reply/¶¶52-54 {A1/25/79}. 654 Art. 625 CC: inflation and interest. The experts agree that, as a matter of Ukrainian law, a claimant is entitled to simple interest at 3% p.a. and that, if the loss is denominated in UAH, the principal amount of the debt will be adjusted upward for inflation: UkrJR/¶111 {C5/1/44}.

The main issue between the experts is whether interest runs from the date of infliction of harm / enrichment (Mr Beketov620) or the date of judgment (Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida621). While Mr Beketov acknowledges that there is some tension in the Ukrainian case law,622 his view is to be preferred. It is consistent with Supreme Court  619  The approach to awarding compound interest under English law is largely the same as under Ukrainian law, viz, “fairly to compensate the recipient of interest for being deprived of money which he should have had…”: Fiona Trust Holding v Privalov [2011] EWHC 664 (Comm) at [13] {M1/15/6}.   620  Beketov8/¶330 {C1/1/109}; UkrJR/¶112.1 {C5/1/44}. 621  UkrJR/¶112.2 {C5/1/44}; Alyoshin1/¶¶307-308 {C2/1/112-113}; Nahnybida3/¶¶261, 265-271 {C4/1/48-52}. See also Nahnybida3/¶¶282 {C4/1/54}. 622  Beketov9/¶431 {C6/1/164}. However, Mr Beketov notes that Mr Nahnybida’s reliance on the Supreme Court’s Resolution of 27.5.20 (Case No. 916/1961/19) at Nahnybida3/¶270 is misplaced, because it related to disgorgement of the defendant’s profits pursuant to Art. 1214(1) CC rather than return of funds which had  \nAA2/1/255\n 250 authority (see Beketov9/¶411-416 {C6/1/157}), the compensatory nature of interest pursuant to Art. 625 CC, and the principle of full compensation.623 The Bank therefore seeks interest and, in relation to any loss denominated in UAH, inflation losses from the date of each Relevant Drawdown. Importantly, as Mr Beketov shows, any judgment given in UAH should be indexed to UAH inflation from the date harm was caused to the date of judgment,624 plus 3% interest.  655 S.35A SCA 1981. The “practical significance of [the availability of pre-judgment interest under the lex causae] … is much reduced” 625  due to the discretion conferred upon the English Court pursuant to s. 35A SCA626 to award pre-judgment simple interest. This is a matter of procedure and therefore of the lex fori;627 the availability of interest in the lex causae may inform – but is not determinative of – the Court’s exercise of its discretion.628 If simple interest is awarded under s. 35A, the Bank claims interest from the date of each Relevant Drawdown at 10.875%, alternatively the rates paid by the Bank on its most expensive borrowing in US$ and/or UAH, alternatively the weighted average cost of its borrowing in US$ and/or UAH.629  656 The Bank will address post-judgment interest (including under s.44A of the Administration of Justice Act 1970) as appropriate following judgment.

But the Bank (as the largest Bank in Ukraine, with c. 30% of all retail customers) was unique, such that it is hard to find evidence of the rate at which a bank ‘with the attributes of the Bank’ would have borrowed except for the actual rates at which the Bank itself did so. In those circumstances, the Bank contends that the rates it seeks are appropriate under s. 35A SCA 1981. \nAA2/1/256\n"}
