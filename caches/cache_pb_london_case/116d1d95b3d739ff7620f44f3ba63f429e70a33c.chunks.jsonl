INTRODUCTION  \n A UKRAINIAN DISPUTE  \n1. This is a Ukrainian dispute:  \n(1) The Claimant  (the Bank) is a la rge state -owned Ukrainian bank. \n(2) D1 and D2 are Ukrainian nationals. T aken t ogether they  owned  in excess of \n80% of  the Bank  at all material times until it was nationalised in December \n2016.1  \n(3) Not only are all the main parties Ukrainian, but the relevant events occurred \nentirely in Ukraine .  \n(4) Consequently, t he claims advanced against D1  and D2 are go verned by \nUkrainian Law.  \n2. Neither D1 nor D2 was domiciled in England when these proceedings were commenced. They were  domiciled in Switzerland. The Court of Appeal accepted \nthat the claims against them  were sufficiently closely related to claims brought by  \nthe Bank against three English companies, D3- D5, and that it was expedient for the \nclaims to be tried together with the result that jurisdiction was established as against D1 under Article 6(1) of the Lugano Convention. \n3. Had the Bank sued D1 in Ukraine, the claim would undoubtedly have failed. Among other fatal problems, a Ukrainian Court would find that the Bank ha d failed \nto identify specific acts, omissions or decisions on the part of D1 that we re unlawful \nas a matter of Ukrainian civil law  or which directly caused the Bank loss. \n4. The Bank presumably hopes that an English court will be more disposed to construe \nand apply Ukrainian law generously in its favour, filling in any perceived gaps by \nrecourse to analogies with English law principles. That is not a legitimate approach \n \n1  D1 Defence/6(3) {A1/8/3 } \nAA3/1/7\n \n2  since the Court ’s task is to apply Ukrainian law as it would be applied in Ukraine, \nnot some anglicised simulacrum  of it. However, English law analogies cannot \nultimately assist the Bank in any event since there is one res pect in which its case \nagainst D1 is irredeemably flawed regardless of what law is applied to it.

However, English law analogies cannot \nultimately assist the Bank in any event since there is one res pect in which its case \nagainst D1 is irredeemably flawed regardless of what law is applied to it. Shortly \nstated, the Bank has simply not suffered the loss for which it claims damages.   \n5. The Bank claims that it suffered loss when it advanced  money under  certain specific \nloans. But the loans that are the subject of the claim have been almost entirely \nrepaid.   Accordingly,  any loss that arose when the Bank advanced money under the  \nloans has been extinguished  and so too has any liability arising from the makin g of \nthe loans . There is no rule of law  that could justify a different  conclusion and enable \nthe Bank to recover damages , and no reason to invent such a rule . This is a complete \nand straightforward defence to virtually the entirety of the Bank’s  claim , and that \nwould be the case whether the Court  were applying Ukrainian law, English law , or \nsome peculiar  amalgam of both. \nA2. SUMMARY OF THE BANK’S CLAIM  \n6. Aside from the wholly Ukrainian context, the claim is also notable for  its enormous \nsize. The Bank  issued proceedings  seeking damages in the principal sum of GBP \n1,429,111,604, t ogether with compound interest.  This was calculated to be the \nsterling equivalent at the date of issue of the Claim Form of a loss identified as USD \n1,911,877,385.2 \n7. In these submissions reference is made to figures present ed in US dollars (“ USD”) \nwithout prejudice to D1’s position that any losses suffered by the Bank were \nsuffered in Ukrainian hryvnia  (“UAH ”).3  \n8. The Bank claims to have suffered its alleged  loss as a result of advancing funds \nunder a number of specific loan facilities (the “Relevant Loans ”). The Relevant \nLoans were granted to 47 Ukrainian companies and 3 Cypriot companies (referred \nto in these submissions as the “Relevant Borrowers ”). They ar e to be distinguished \n \n2  Claim Form { A1/1/1 } \n3  The “Currency of Any Loss ” is addressed in Section J  below  \nAA3/1/8\n \n3  from other loans  and loan facilities referred to in the context of the dispute which , \nwhile factually important,  are not themselves the subject of any claim by the Bank.  \n9. The Bank’s transaction data record s that, in the case of each of the Relevant Loans, \nspecific drawdowns ( the “Relevant Drawdowns ”) were advanced for the purpose \nof funding the Relevant Borrower’s acquisition of certain goods from one  or other  \nof D3 -D8 ( the “Defendant Suppliers ”) under a supply agreement ( together the \n“Relevant Supply  Agreement s”). The Relevant Borrowers made prepayments for \nthe goods which were  not returned ( the “Unreturned Prepayments ”) and received \nno goods from the Defendant Suppliers.  \n10. The Bank’s case is that the Relevant Supply Agreements and the Relevant Loans \nwere “shams ” which were used to deprive the Bank of funds . The amount claimed \nin the Claim Form is the precise amount of the Unreturned Prepayments made by the Relevant Borrowers to the Relevant Suppliers.  \n11. The Bank has not sued any of the R elevant Borrowers. To the contrary, for all \npurposes other than this litigation it has treated the Relevant Drawdowns as having \nbeen repaid, and the Relevant Borrowers as having no further liability in connection \nwith the sums withdrawn under the Relevant Loans.  \n12. In these proceedings, the Bank advances two main causes of action :  \n(1) First, the Bank makes a  claim against D3 -D8 (but not against D1 or D2)  in \nunjust enrichment, in respect of the  Unreturned Prepayments received by \nthem from the Relevant Borrowers  in the amount of USD  1,911,877,835. The \nBank claims that D3 -D8 received the Unreturned Prepayments at its expense \non the basis that  they were “ caused ”4 (or “ funded”"}

In these proceedings, the Bank advances two main causes of action :  \n(1) First, the Bank makes a  claim against D3 -D8 (but not against D1 or D2)  in \nunjust enrichment, in respect of the  Unreturned Prepayments received by \nthem from the Relevant Borrowers  in the amount of USD  1,911,877,835. The \nBank claims that D3 -D8 received the Unreturned Prepayments at its expense \non the basis that  they were “ caused ”4 (or “ funded”, as the Bank’s ex pert \nforensic accountant, Mr Thompson, prefers to say5) by the Relevant \nDrawdowns.  \n \n4  Claim/16 { A1/2/7 } \n5  Thompson1/2.2(a) { D1/1/23} \nAA3/1/9\n \n4  (2) Secondly , the Bank claims damages in tort against all the Defendants. As \nagainst D1 and D2, the Bank alleges that they were the ultimate beneficiaries \nof “the misappropriation of $ 1,911,877,835 of the Bank’s funds between \nApril 2013 and September 2014 (the “Misappropriation” )”.6 The alleged \nMisappropriation is said to have consisted of the transfer of funds from the \nBank to the Relevant Borrowers under the Relevant Loans, and then from the \nBorrowers to the Defendant Suppliers under the Relevant Supply Agreements \nin the form of Unreturned Prepayments.7    \n13. D3-D8 are not the Bank’s real target. They could not possibly afford to pay the \nsums claimed if the Bank’s claims against them were successful. They have only \nbeen joined as a pretext for suing D 1 and D2 in England. However, it is the \nformulation of the claim in Unjust Enrichment against D3 -D8 which explains how \nthe Bank identified the Relevant Drawdowns  which comprise the alleged \nMisappropriation that is the subject of its claim against D1 -D2:  \n(1) The Bank did not make payments to D3- D8 directly. Thus, in order to claim \nthat the Unreturned Prepayments were made at its expense, the Bank needed to identify payments  advanced to borrowers  which reached D3 -D8 indirectly.  \n(2) The Bank’s transaction data logged transfers of money by reference to the \nSupply Agreement reference number. The Bank has linked transactions  for \nwhich the narrative description in the transaction data mentions the Relevant Supply Agreement reference number.  \n(3) It appears that there were a number of prepayment and returns of prepayments before there was an Unreturned Prepayment and that deposits to and transfers \nfrom the Relevant Borrowers’ accounts occurred in the meantime. However, \nusing the Relevant Supply Agreement number ,\n8 and tracing backwards9 from \n \n6  Claim /5 {A1/2/2 } \n7  The details of the alleged Misappropriation are pleaded at Claim/16 -32 {A1/2/7 -23} \n8  This is referred to by the Forensic Accountants as “the Bank ’s Methodology ”. It does not involve a \nconventional funds flow tracing analysis.  \n9  Para 24(a) of the Bank ’s Further Information of 5 May 20 20 in response to Request 29 of D2’ s RFI \nof 24 March  2020 {A2/4/2 3} \nAA3/1/10\n \n5  the Unreturned Prepayments, the Bank has identified the original advances of \nmoney to the Relevant Borrowers which it claims “caused ” or “funded” the \nUnreturned Prepayments.  \n(4) The total sum of the Relevant Drawdowns exceeds the amount of the \nUnreturned Prepayments because some of the Relevant Drawdowns were \nonly partly used to fund or cause the Unreturned Prepayments .10 The Bank’s \ncalculation of its loss starts with the amount of  the Unreturned Prepayments \nand, net of credit which it is prepared to recognise , ends in a valuation of  \naround USD 1.8 billion.11 \nA3.

Insofar as D1 does not comment herein on particular matters addressed in the Bank ’s \nOpening Submissions he should not be taken to accept their accuracy or relevance . \n13  The only Relevant Loans that have not been repaid are those to Prominmet and Tamersa but only \nUSD 37 million is outstanding in Respect of the Relevant Drawdowns and only USD 25 million in \nrespect of the Relevant Drawdown Portions ( Davidson3/3.124 {D2/20/61} ): see Section M5 below . \nAA3/1/11\n \n6  (2) Repayment by the transfer of assets pledged as security (the “ Asset \nTransfer” ); and \n(3) Repayment by further loans in the course of the transformation of the Bank’s \nloan portfolio (the “ New Loans ”) immediately before the Ba nk was \nnationalised in December 2016. \n17. In those circumstances, D1 submits, any loss caused to the Bank by advancing the  \nRelevant Drawdowns no longer  exists  and there is nothing which can be \ncompensated by way of a tortious claim . This is referred to as the “ Repayment \nDefence” . \n18. The Bank’s response  to the Repayment Defence is essentially to contend that the \nrepayments themselves  were not “valid ” and should be “ ignored”14 or \n“disregarded” ,15 because the Intermediary and New L oans were not “ legitimate ” \nbut were en tered into for the purpose of disguising the alleged misappropriation  of \nfunds under the Relevant Loans.16  \n19. Similarly, the Bank asserts that it was misled as to the value of the assets the subject \nof the Asset Transfer , and that any credit granted to the Re levant Borrowers in \nexcess of the “true ” value of the Transferred Assets should be “ disregarded”.17  \n20. Despite these allegations, the Bank has not reversed any transactions in its books so as, for example, to recredit the Intermediary Borrowers with sums transferred to \nthe Relevant Borrowers’ accounts or to recredit the New Borrowers with sums paid \nto discharge Relevant and Intermediary Loans. On the contrary, the Bank’s \naccounts continue to treat the Relevant Loans as repaid and the New Loans as \ncreating valid and outstanding debts.\n18  \n \n14  Claim /62(1) {A1/2/34 }; Reply /34 {A1/25/65 } \n15  Reply/27B.3 { A1/25/36}  \n16  Claim /62(1) {A1/2/34 } \n17  Beketov8/151 {C1/1/49} ; Reply/27F.7.3, Reply/27F.8 { A1/25/ 42} \n18  The New Loans were treated by the Bank as impaired until being written off in the 2020 and 2021 \nfinancial statements.  \nAA3/1/12\n \n7  21.

{"start": 31500, "text": "  The New Loans were treated by the Bank as impaired until being written off in the 2020 and 2021 \nfinancial statements.  \nAA3/1/12\n \n7  21.

D1 will submit that that contention is wrong. It would certainly be wrong as a matter of English law, and the Bank’s own Ukrainian law expert, Mr Beketov, accepts that \nthere is no authority to support it in Ukrainian law. That is not surprising becaus e a \nrule which enabled repayments of loans to be “ ignored” or “disregarded” in order \nto allow a tortious claim to be brought against a third party would ha ve no \njustification : it would be wholly unnecessary, defy logic and common sense, and \nlead to serious  practical difficulties.   \n23. The true position is straightforward. The Relevant Loans were repaid out of the \nproceeds of New Loans and the Asset Transfer. Any loss which is now outstanding \ntherefore resulted not from the Relevant Loans but from the making of  unsecured \nNew Loans and/or the over -valuation of Transferred Assets. If, as the Bank asserts, \nthe New Loans and the Asset Transfer were themselves wrongfully procured by D1 and D2 then, on the Bank’s case, it could have brought a claim against D1 and D2 \narising out of that  later wrongdoing . But that later wrongdoing is separate and \ndistinct from the alleged procuring of the Relevant Loans, and any loss arising from the New Loans and the Asset Transfer is also separate and distinct from any loss \nthat arose from the making of the Relevant Loans. The former loss has been \nextinguished, and (contrary to the Bank’s case)  cannot be revived by recourse to a \nUkrainian legal fiction.\n19 \n24. In short, the Bank elected – whether for jurisdictional or other reasons –  to claim  \nonly in respect of loss caused by drawdowns under Relevant Loans , while m aking \nno claim in relation to the Intermediary or New Loans or the Asset Transfer. \n \n19  Leaving aside the Relevant Drawdowns which were not repaid one way or another, i.e. the loans to \nTamersa and Prominmet, which are discussed further in Section M5  below.  \nAA3/1/13\n \n8  However, the consequence of that election is that there is no relevant loss for which \nthe Bank can recover compensation . Accordingly, the claim must necessarily fail.  \nA3(2)  The Alternative Use of Funds Defence  \n25. The Bank itself introduces the issue of identifying what the  money advanced under \nthe Relevant Drawdowns w as used for by alleging that they “funded ”20 the \nUnreturned Prepayments. Applying a conventional tracing analysis, it can be seen \nthat a large amount of the money was used to pay off other loans. \n26. Under English law as explained in National Bank Trust v Yurov [2020] EWHC \n100 (Comm) , if D1 were liable i n respect of the misappropriation of a Relevant \nLoan, he would not be able to claim that the repayment of an earlier loan which would otherwise not have been repaid should be taken into account to reduce his \nliability. The experts on Ukrainian law agree th at Ukrainian law is no different in \nthis respect. However, in countering the Repayment Defence, Mr Beketov advances a view of Ukrainian law which diverges from the analysis in Yurov  whereby the \nrepayment of a loan extinguishes the loss caused by the advance of money under that loan. If Mr Beketov were right,  then it would follow that Ukrainian law is not \nthe same as English law  after all .  \n27. Accordingly, if (and only if) the Court should take the view that the repayment of \nthe Relevant Drawdowns can be ignored as the "}

If Mr Beketov were right,  then it would follow that Ukrainian law is not \nthe same as English law  after all .  \n27. Accordingly, if (and only if) the Court should take the view that the repayment of \nthe Relevant Drawdowns can be ignored as the Bank contends, then , when \nanalysing  the loss caused to the Bank by the advance of funds under the Relevant \nDrawdowns, account should be taken of the net effect of advancing those funds on \nthe Bank’s financial position, such that  D1 is entitled to a credit in respect of any \namount used to repay loans which would not otherwise have been repaid. \n28. This is referred to as the “ Use of Funds Defence ” and it is advanced in the \nalternative to the Repayment Defence.  If this Defence is accepted , then the claim \nreduces to:  \n(1) USD 620 million, i f the Bank’s loss is measu red in Relevant Drawdowns; or \n \n20  Thompson1/2.2(a) { D1/1/23} \nAA3/1/14\n \n9  (2) USD 577 million , if the Bank’s loss is measure d in Relevant Drawdown \nPortions . \n29. These figures are premised on the claim and defences remaining wholly \ndenominated in USD (which is disputed21). The sums outstanding would be \nsignificantly less if the Bank is found to have suffered a loss in UAH and USD, or \njust in UAH.22   \nA3(3)  The No Unlawful Conduct Defence  \n30. Quite apart from the fact that the loss claimed has not been suffered, t he Bank’s \nfailure to identify any specific acts, omissions or decisions which are alleged to \nhave been unlawful is  also fatal to the claim against D1 under Ukrainian Law . \n31. Article 1166 requires specific conduct to be identified and proved to be unlawful . \nDamages can only be awarded if and to the extent that a defendant’s particular \nunlawful acts, decisions or omissions are proved to have directly caused a loss.  \n32. Although the Bank goes to great lengths to seek to  establish D1 and D2’s ownership \nand control of the Relevant Borrowers and other companies involved, it is not sufficient under Ukrainian l aw for the Bank simply to prove the fact of ownership \nor control and, on that basis alone, to request that the Court infer that D1 and D2 “must have ” been responsible for the making of the Relevant Drawdowns by \nsomehow procuring others to misappropriate fund s from the Bank on their behalf .  \n33. Apart from being hopelessly vague, s uch allegations are, in substance, allegations \nof conduct which is unlawful under Ukrainian law only under specific provisions of the  Criminal Code.  \n34. It is agreed by the Ukrainian law experts that (contrary to  the Bank’s pleaded \nposition\n23) the Bank  cannot  rely on allegations of purely criminal conduc t under \nUkrainian law to establish a claim in tort under Article 1166 , without first having \n \n21  See Section J  below.   \n22  See Section M7(2)  below  \n23  Reply/12 { A1/25/20}  \nAA3/1/15\n \n10  established the fact of the crime by obtaining a conviction.24 In the absence of a \ncriminal conviction , “the claimant must show that the defendant’s alleged conduct \nis unlawful as a matter of civil law ”.25 \n35. D1 has not been convicted of any offence in Ukraine or anywhere else which relates \nto the making of the Relevant Loans (or any of the loans mentioned by the Bank in \nconnection with the claims made in these proceeding s). The Bank therefore cannot \n(and does not26) advance allegations of criminal conduct.  \n36. The Bank maintains  that it can establish liability without proving the commission \nof a criminal offence and identifies  various provisions of civil law which it contends \nrender D1’s alleged conduct unlawful. However, some of these provisions do not \nimpose anything in the nature of an actionable legal duty and are not capable of giving rise to a claim in tort, while t"}

The Bank maintains  that it can establish liability without proving the commission \nof a criminal offence and identifies  various provisions of civil law which it contends \nrender D1’s alleged conduct unlawful. However, some of these provisions do not \nimpose anything in the nature of an actionable legal duty and are not capable of giving rise to a claim in tort, while the Bank can sh ow no breach of any provisions \nwhich are capable of so doing. It follows that the Bank cannot show any unlawful \nconduct by D1  which sounds in damages. \nA3(4)  No fault / No causation \n37. In addition to harm and unlawful conduct, the cause of action under Article  1166 \nCC also requires that:  \n(1) the defendant acted with fault (i.e. intention or negligence) ; and  \n(2) the defendant’s unlawful conduct caused the harm.  \n38. If D1 is correct that the Bank has not suffered the harm alleged and/or that he did not act unlawfully, these issues will not arise. However, in the event that they do \narise, it is D1’s case that neither of the elements of fault and causation can be \nestablished  on the evidence before the Court.  \n \n24  Under Article 62 of the Ukrainian Constitution, a person is presumed to be innocent until convicted \nby a criminal court and it is not open to a claimant in a civil lawsuit to rely on allegations of crim inal \nconduct unless and until a crim inal verdict has been delivered.  \n25  Joint Statement of Experts on Ukrainian Law  (“ULJS ”)/38 {C5/1/18} \n26  Although it bandies around terms such as “ fraud”, “ embezzlement ” and “money laundering” and \npleads a “ misappropriation”, the Bank does not formally allege the commission of any criminal \noffences under the relevant provisions  of the Ukrainian Criminal Code.  \nAA3/1/16\n \n11  39. As to fault, there is no reason to suppose that D1 did not intend the Rele vant Loans \nto be repaid  (as they were) . \n40. As to causation, D1’s case, supported by his expert Mr Alyoshin, is that the \napplicable test of causation in Ukrainian law is strict and requires  the relevant causal \nlink to be “ direct, necessary and inevitable ”.27 As to that: \n(1) There is no evidence, or even any allegation, that D1 did anything which \ncaused the Bank harm in that sense. Indirectly requesting or procuring the \nmaking of Relevant Loans by the Bank, even if proven, would not be \nsufficient.  \n(2) The attempt to fix  D1 with liability for causing or procuring misconduct by \nother (unnamed) people which in turn caused the Bank loss is in reality an \nattempt to import into  Article 1166 CC concepts of  accessory liability derived \nfrom English civil law and/or  Ukrainian criminal law which have no \ncounterparts in Ukrainian civil law and, as such, is not permissible. \nA3(5)  The Limitation Defence  \n41. D1’s primary case is that the entire claim is time -barred  due to the expiry of the \nthree year limitation period applicable un der Ukrainian law  prior to the \ncommencement of proceedings on 21 December 20 17.28  \n42. Alternatively, D1 contends that the Bank’s claims in respect of loans to Prominmet \nand the Cypriot Borrowers are time barred as they are deemed to take effect from \nthe date of issue of a protective claim form  on 14 July 2020.29  \n43. As for D1’s primary case,  \n(1) Under Article 261(1), the limitation period starts to run from the date on \nwhich a person became or could have become aware of a violation of his right or of the person who vi olated such right.  \n \n27  ULJS/41.2 {C5/1/19}  \n28  D1 Defence/84 -87 {A1/8/49- 50} \n29  D1 Defence/ 87 {A1/8/5 0} \nAA3/1/17\n \n12  (a) If the Relevant Loans were void, then the Bank’s cause of action in \nrestitution commenced when the Relevant Drawdowns were made.  \n(b) If they were valid then the Bank’s cause of action in contract accrued \nwhen they were not repaid (validly)  on time .  \n(2) So far as the Bank’s knowledge is c"}

On the contrary, it highlights the Bank’s credit files and the \nterms of the supply agreements to suggest they were obviously shams. \n(b) Furthermore, a llegations of wrongdoing in relation to  lending which \nfunded  payments made to D3- D8 were in the public domain by \nNovember 2014 at the latest.30  \n(c) If the claim that the Relevant Drawdowns were not validly repaid is a good one  (which is of course denied)  then it must follow that the Bank \nknew or ought to have known the facts on which the claim is based \nmore tha n three years before proceedings were brought on 21 December \n2017.\n31  \n44. The Bank seeks to persuade the Court that the limitation period did not start to run \nwhile D1 and D2 owned the Bank ( or that it should be disapplied until the Bank’s \nnew management were i n a position to issue proceedings after nationalisation).32 \nHowever,  the burden lies on the Bank to demonstrate that  there were objective \nreasons beyond the Bank’s control that prevented or significantly hindered the claimant from bringing the action within  the limitation period.  \n \n30  D1 Defence/86 {A1/8/4 9} \n31  Claim Form { A1/1/1 } \n32  Reply/23 {A1/25/28 } \nAA3/1/18\n \n13  45. Even if the whole of the claim is not statute -barred, the limitation period must still \napply to prevent claims being brought in respect of the two loans to Cypriot \nRelevant Borrowers and Prominmet which were  new causes of action  only added \nto these proceedings on 14 July 2020  and which did not arise out of the same or \nsubstantially the same facts and matters as were already in issue. There is no \njustification for delaying the start of the limitation period until August 2017 as the Bank contends.\n33 \nA4. CURRENCY OF ANY LOSS  \n46. In its claim form, the Bank claimed the precise amount of the Unreturned Prepayments which was USD 1,911,877,385 and calculated that this was the \nequivalent of GBP 1,429,111,604 at that date.  \n47. D1 does not accept that if the Bank suffered a loss, it was one felt by the Bank wholly or partly in USD.  \n48. While D3 -D8 each received USD  from Relevant Borrowers , the Bank needs to \nprove the currency of its “ expense” even for the purpose of its Unjust Enrichment \nclaim. So far as its claim in tort is concerned, the Bank  must prove the currency in \nwhich it  experienced the “loss” claimed and the amount of that loss . Payments made \nby Relevant Borrowers to third parties have no bearing on either issue.  \n49. As explained  further in Section J below, since the Bank claims that it was caused \nloss as a result of making Relevant Drawdowns the starting point is that the Bank’s immediate loss consisted of the amount and currency of each Relevant Drawdown. \nAt the next stage of analysis, the question becomes whether the making of the \nRelevant Drawdown came at a cost to the Bank which can most appropriately be \nmeasured in a currency which is different from that of the Relevant Drawdown. \n \n33  Reply/23.1A {A1/25/28 } \nAA3/1/19\n \n14  50.

D1 submits that the Bank cannot establish that it suffered a loss in US D and as a \nresult the claim is very clearly overstated as a result of the appreciation in the value \nof USD over time:  \n(1) A large number  of Relevant Drawdowns  were advanced  in UAH and the Bank \nhas put forward no proper explanation as to how it might have incur red a cost \nin USD in providing those UAH to Relevant Borrowers when its functional currency is UAH . The subsequent conversion of the borrowed funds into \nUSD is entirely separate and caused the Bank no loss.  \n(2) Only some of the Relevant Loans were denominated in USD. However , the \nBank has not advanced a positive case that it had to borrow USD in order to lend USD , or that it had reserves of USD which it depleted by advancing \nRelevant Drawdowns in USD . The inference to be drawn from the absence \nof such evidence is that the Bank bought the necessary amount of  USD with \nUAH in order to lend USD to the Relevant Borrowers .  \n51. If the Bank’s loss is measured by reference to the parts of Relevant Drawdowns \nwhich funded Unreturned Prepayments and the amount of those Relevant Drawdown Portions  is wholly  stated in UAH,  Mr Davidson calculates that  the \nprincipal amount of the claim is worth no more than UAH 19,420 million. \n52. D1 contends that this is the appropriate starting point in any calculation of loss to the Bank. This  is the amount of the Bank’s claim before any consideration is given \nto the credit to be applied as a result of D1’s Repayment Defence or Use of Funds Defence.  \n53. UAH 19,420 million is the equivalent of GBP 521 million\n34 - rather less than the \nsum of GBP 1,429,111,604 claimed.35  \n \n34  See Davidson3/Table2 -3 {D2/20/30} , applying exchange rates at the date of the Claim Form . \n35  D1 Defence/83I  {A1/8/48}  \nAA3/1/20\n \n15  B. FACTUAL BACKGROUND  \n \n54. The parties have agreed a Chronology of Key Events.36 \n55. The important factual disputes between the parties are addressed in Section D .  D1 \nalso emphasizes some key events relevant to his Limitation Defences in Section I . \nD1 relies in particular on the publication of an article in Glavcom in November \n2014 reporting facts on which the Bank’s claim is based. The NBU investigated \nthose allegations by making enquiries of the Bank so the suggestion that the \ntransactions relied  on by the Bank as constituting the alleged Misappropriation were \neffectively “disguised” is misconceived. Thereafter the NBU and the Bank impleme nted the Restructuring Program  which involved the repayment of the \nbalance of the Relevant Loans by Asset Tran sfer and the issue of New Loans. \n56. D1 is convinced that his rival, then-President Petro Poroshenko, facilitated various \nchanges in legislation  which were implemented between 2014 and 2016 relating to \nthe identification of related parties to the Bank and the form of valid and acceptable \nsecurity for loans  as part of a political campaign against him personally  which led \nto the nationalisation of the Bank.\n37 In her evidence, Ms Ro zhkova describes how \nlegislative changes were driven by the IMF. The Court is not, of course,  expected \nto resolve this dispute as it does not affect the issues in the case.  \n57. On 18 December 20 16, by NBU Resolution No.498-rsh/BT, the NBU declared the \nBank insolvent, and submitted a proposal to the Cabinet of Ministers (i.e., the \ngovernment) that the Bank be nationalised. That proposal was approved the \nfollowing day, and implemented by the Deposit Guarantee Fund (the “DGF ”), the \nbody with responsibility for insolvent banks under Ukrainian  law.38  \n \n36  Chronology of Key Events { AA1/4/1 } \n37  His account is set out in Kolomoisky5/19 -25 {B2/1/5 -6} \n38  Rozhkova1/278 {B1/5/66 }; Surkis & Ors v Poroshenko and Go"}

One of the steps taken by the DG F after the Bank was nationalised  was a ‘bail -in’: \nArticle 41 -1 of the Law of Ukraine on Households Deposit Guarantee System (the \n“DGF Law ”) permits the DGF to exchange funds held in accounts of an insolvent \nbank’s ‘related parties’ for shares in the bank’s capital, which are then acquired by \nthe state.39   \n59. Between 19  and 21 December 20 16, the DGF converted UAH 29.438 billion (then \nequivalent to USD 1.115 billion) of liabilities (in the form of deposits, Eurobonds \nand subordinated debt) owed by the Bank to those persons and entities, including \nD1, who had been designated as the Bank’s “ related parties ”.40 The Bank’s shares \n– pre-existing and newly converted – were then sold by the DGF to the Ukrainian \nMinistry of Financ e for a nominal UAH 1.41  \n60. Formally, by a letter of en gagement dated 20 October 2016,42 the NBU  engaged \nKroll to conduct an investigation into the activities of the Bank, its Cyprus Branch \nand its affiliate in Latvia between 1 January 2007 and 16 December 20 16. The \nspecific purpose of the investigation was to gather evidence to support a legal strategy for potential civil and criminal proceedings in multiple jurisdictions.\n43 \n61. A report was produced in November 2017  (the “Kroll Report ”). Kroll concluded44 \nthat, as a result of the making of the New Loans, the Bank ha d suffered a loss which \nwas the equivalent of at least USD 5.5 billion: \n“The fraud involved loans being issued to a network of parties related to the former \nUBOs of the Bank and their affiliates Funds from these loans were subjected to a \nmechanism to disguise the onward flows, through a series of accounts in the names \nof shell companies controlled by the former UBOs or their affiliates, and were in part channelled to other destinations for the benefit of the former UBOs or their \naffiliates. The loans, and t he interest due on these loans, were then repaid through \nthe issuing of new loans to other parties related to the former UBOs, which in turn \nwere repaid by further loans.

However, the Bank has not \nwritten off the New Loans and continues to receive payments due in respect of them from the New Borrowers.  \n64. D1 is the claimant in proceedings in Ukraine contesting the lawfulness of the NBU’s nationalisation of the Bank but this issue does not arise for determination in \nthese proceedings.  \nC. THE BANK’S CLAIM  \nC1. WHAT THE BANK IS CLAIMING  \n65. The precise formulation of the Bank’s claim is of critical significance in this case.  \n66. The Bank has chosen narrowly to confine its claims in tort against D1 and D2 to \nclaims for damages caused by the advances of money under the  Relevant  \nDrawdowns  – that is, the drawdowns under Relevant Loans which it has identified \nas having caused or funded the Unreturned Prepayments made to D3-D8.  \n67. The Relevant Loans were made to 47 Ukrainian Borrowers and 3 Cypriot \nBorrowers. The facilities were granted between 3 April 2013 and 21 August  201445 \n \n45  Thompson1, Appendix 3-3-6  {D1/105/1}) \nAA3/1/23\n \n18  and Relevant Drawdowns were advanced between 1 November 2013 and 1 \nSeptember 2014.46 \n68. In terms of the  supposed “loan recycling scheme ” contemplated by Mr Beketov ,47 \ntherefore, the  alleged Misappropriation of the bank’s funds48 pursuant to the \nRelevant Loans  occurred not at the beginning of any such  scheme, nor at the end, \nbut somewhere in the middle.49 \n69. The Bank’s decision to base its claim specifically on the Relevant Drawdowns  (and \nto claim they caused it loss only insofar as they caused  or funded the Unreturned \nPrepayments ) to the exclusion of any alleged scheme as a whole or any  of what \nmight be other elem ents of it, is probably  explained by a perceived need  to \ndemonstrate that the claims against D1 and D2 were sufficiently “related ” to the \nclaims against D3 -D8 to establish the Court’s jurisdiction over the m. Hence the \nBank alleges that D3 -D8 are jointly liable with D1 and D2 for the loss caused by \nthe Misappropriation50 - an allegation that the Bank could not have made in relation \nto loans other than the Relevant Loans.  \n70. Alternatively, the Bank may have chosen to focus  solely  on the Relevant Loans  for \nsome other reason, such as a desire to avoid an investigation into the circumstances \nof the Bank’s nationali sation and the extent to which it has been compensated by \nthe bail in or by the Ukrainian state for any losses that it ultimately  suffered  as a \nresult of  a loan recycling scheme.  \n71. Whatever the reason  may be , the fact  is that the Bank has made a deliberate tactical \nchoice to confine its claim to  the loss of (most of) the money advanced under  the \n \n46  Thompson1, Appendix 3- 3-1 {D1/100 /1} \n47  Beketov9/200(e) {C6/1/84} ; see also the Kroll Report  {H1/17/66} ; {K5-B12/158L/5}  \n48  The alleged Misappropriation of the Bank ’s funds is alleged to have taken place between April 2013 \nand September 2014 in Claim/5 { A1/2/2 } \n49  Lewis1/97: “…the Bank ’s transactional data suggests that  this system of prepayment and return of \nprepayment that characterises the early part of the Lending Scheme may have been implemented \nbetween certain of the Borrowers and Suppliers as early as 2008 … ” {H1/1/22 } \n50  Claim/54 -55 {A1/2/31- 32} \nAA3/1/24\n \n19  Relevant Drawdowns and it has made its posi"}

Please confirm that it is the Claimant ’s case that no corporate lending to \ncompanies alleged to have been owned or controlled by D1 or D2 other than the \nRelevant Loans caused the Claimant any loss and, if so, explain why the \nRelevant Loans and no other such lending is alleged to have caused it loss. ” \n(b) The Bank responded as follows:  \n“3. …. The Bank ’s case in these proceedings is in respect of the loss caused \nto the Bank i n respect of the Relevant Drawdowns. The Bank ’s rights to claim \nin respect of other losses arising from other lending are strictly reserved .”  \n72. The total amount drawn down under the Relevant Loans was USD 3.3 billion, of \nwhich  the Relevant Drawdowns account  for USD 2.3 billion.54  \n73. However, a s the Bank is claiming to have suffered loss only  in so far as the  Relevant \nDrawdowns caused or funded the Unreturned Prepayments , the claim is not for \nUSD 2.3 billion, but is “ only” for USD 1.9 billion.  \n \n51  “Particulars o f the drawdowns under the Relevant Loans, a portion of which caused the Unreturned \nPrepayments (as defined below) (the “ Relevant Drawdowns ”), including the date of each Relevant \nDrawdown and the amount, are in Appendix 3- 3-1 of the Thompson Report ”: Claim/ 16 {A1/2/7 } \n52  Claim/5 {A1/2/2 } \n53  Bank ’s Further Information in response  to Request 3 of D1 ’s RFI of 21 April 2020 {A2/9/6 } (i.e., \nthe “22 May Response ”) \n54  FAJS1 /2.2 {D4/1/4 } \nAA3/1/25\n \n20  74. It is obvious from the difference between USD 2.3 billion and USD 1.9 billion that  \nonly part of the  Relevant Drawdowns  caused or funded the Unreturned \nPrepayments . This is common ground.55  \n75. While  it insists that its claim is for  loss caused by the Relevant Drawdowns as a  \nwhole,56 the Bank has now57 identified those parts of the Relevant Drawdowns \nwhich (applying the Bank’s Methodology), funded the Unreturned Prepayments . \nThese are referred to as “Relevant Drawdown Portions ”.  \n76. The difference between the parties is that:  \n(1) D1 c ontends that the Relevant Drawdown Portions  amounting to USD 1.9 \nbillion are the starting point for any analysis of repayment.  \n(2) The Bank disagrees contending that this level of analysis is not necessary  and \ninsists that the starting point is USD 2.3 billio n of Relevant Drawdowns . \n77. Even if the claim is properly formulated as being to the loss in relation to  Relevant \nDrawdowns  rather than Relevant Drawdown Portions,  D1 contends that in \ncircumstances where the Relevant Drawdowns have been repaid, the  loss that the \nBank claims to have suffered has not in fact occurred at all , with the result that the \nclaim fails altogether .58  \nC2.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF UNRETURNED PREPAYMENTS  \nC2(1)  Central Focus of the Bank’s Methodology \n78. The way in which the Bank links a Relevant Drawdown to an Unreturned \nPrepayment is by identifying and connecting transactions recorded in its Transactional Data as being related to a particular Supply Agreement number. This \n \n55  22 May Response, p. 3 { A2/9/3 } \n56  See Section M4  below  \n57  In Thompson3 {D1/440} \n58  See further Section F  below addressing the Repayment Defence in detail . \nAA3/1/26\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n is not a conventional tracing pr ocess. This method  works backwards59 from the \nUnreturned Prepayments to show that the Unreturned Prepayments “ resulte d \nfrom ”60 the Relevant Drawdowns and does not follow a flow of funds in and out of \nbank accounts. As the Bank submitted in the Court of Appeal: \n“… prepayments outstanding from the [Defendant Suppliers] are appropriately to be \nlinked with loans made to borrowers much earlier in time, notwithstanding \nintervening transactions.”61\n79. It is not accepted by D1 that the Bank’s Methodology establishes tha t the Relevant \nDrawdowns “ caused ”62 or “funded”63 the Unreturned Prepayments as alleged by \nthe Bank. Using a conventional funds flow analysis, applying “Exact Matching”, \nnone of the Relevant Drawdowns fund Unreturned Prepayments: see Section M 3 \nbelow. \nC2(2)  Not the Subject of a Proprietary Claim  \n80. Despite having referred to the Misappropriation of “ the Bank’s funds ” in the \nspecific amount of the Unreturned Prepayments ,64 the Bank  has clarified that its \nclaim  in tort  under Article 1166 does not require proof that the  Unreturned \nPrepayments were the Bank’s funds in the proprietary sense65 and that it advances \nno proprietary claim.  \nIn Further Information, the Bank cross -refers66 to the Judgment of the Court of \nAppeal on the Jurisdictional Challenge: 81. \n“222. …. The bank, Mr Hunter stressed, has never advanced any proprietary claim , \nand its tortious claim is for compensation for the amount drawn down under the \nrelevant loans which was not repaid. The particulars of claim, Mr Hunter argued, \n59 Para 24(a) of the Bank’s Further Information of 05 May 2020 in response to Request 29 of D2’s\nRFI of 24 March 2020 {A2/4/23}\nSee  paragraph  239  of  the  Court  of  Appeal’s  Judgment  {A5/12/\n61} See paragra ph 238 of the Court of Appeal’s Judgment { A5/12/\n61} Claim/16 { A1/2/7}\nThompson1/2.2( a) {D1/1/23}\nClaim/5 {A1/2/2} ; see als o Claim/34 { A1/2/24}\nSee also Reply/13.4, 35.1 { A1/25/21 }\nParagraph 11, 22 October Re sponse N o.2 {A2/16/11}60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n66 \n21 \n{A1/25/65}\n AA3/1/27\n \n22  include allegations that the English  and BVI defendants received proceeds of the \nfraud, but the bank ’s case does not depend on that having been the case. ” \n82. While the Bank hints at the possibility of an alternative proprietary claim in its \nReply,67 it does so only in case it is necessary for it  to establish one and bases it on \nan initial analysis of the flow of funds set out in the Lafferty Spreadsheets . \nHowever , it is clear that no such claim is advanced :  \n(1) the Bank’s expert, Mr Beketov, provides no analysis under Ukrainian Law \nwhich would support any such claim ;  \n(2) Mr Alyoshin for D1 confirms that there is no basis for one ;68 and \n(3) D1 no longer relies on the Lafferty Spreadsheets  and the Bank does not accept \nthey are accurate in any event ; \n(4) in its Opening Submissions, the Bank makes no reference to any proprietary claim even in the alternative .  \nC2(3)  The Identification of the Bank’s Loss the Subject of the Claim  \n83.

Not only does the Bank not advance a proprietary claim but, despite claiming \ndamages by reference to  the precise amount of the Unreturned Prepaym ents, the \nBank  now contends that  it is not essential to its cause of action in tort against D1 to \ndemonstrate that the Relevant Drawdowns caused or funded the Unreturned \nPrepayments.\n69  \n84. While it is correct that the making of the Unreturned Prepayments itself caused the \nBank no loss, the claim was always  limited to the amount of the Unreturned \nPrepayments because that the Bank  advanced no  claim for loss caused by th ose \n \n67  The Bank pleads that based on the Lafferty Spreadsheets (adjusted for errors) at least USD 554 \nmillion of the monies advanced by the Borrowers pursuant to the Relevant Loans was paid to D3-\nD8: Reply/36.2 {A1/25/68 } cross referring to Thompson1/5.25 {D1/1/156}  and associated \nappendices.

The only relevance of the Bank’s Supply Agreement tracing  exercise is that it \nenables the movements of money from the Bank to the Relevant Borrowers which \nthe Bank claims caused it a loss  (i.e. the Relevant Drawdowns  and in particula r the \nRelevant Drawdown Portions) to be identified. \n86. Once the Relevant Drawdowns (or Relevant Drawdown Portions) have been \nidentified, it is common ground that the Bank has suffered no loss to the extent that \nthey have been repaid. The dispute between the parties is as to the extent to which \nthey have been repaid but  the fact that Unreturned Prepayments were not returned \nis irrelevant to the analysis of whether a repayment should be taken into account as \nreducing any loss arising from a Relevant Drawdown .  \nD. FACTUAL DISPUTES  \n87. Strikingly, none of the Bank’s 10 factual witnesses identify any act, omission or \ndecision that can be attributed to D1 personally which is alleged to have caused the \nBank’s loss.  Instead, the Bank seeks to prove the key factual allegations of its case \nagainst D1 on the basis of a series of inferences rather than direct evidence.   \n88. The Bank has s ought, in exhaustive detail  in Sections A to H of its Opening \nSubmissions, to establish the foundations for those inferences. The main pillars of \nthe Bank’s factual case are addressed shortly below, but essentially, D1’s  position \nis that the Bank’s factual case against him is irrelevant , in that even if proved it is \ninsufficient to establish liability on the part of D1  to the Bank under Ukrainian ci vil \nlaw.    \nAA3/1/29\n \n24  D1.

As noted above, none of the Bank’s witnesses identif ies any act, omission or \ndecision that can be attributed to D1 personally and which is alleged to have caused \nthe Bank’s loss.  And although D1 was a member of the Bank’s Supervisory Board, \nit is not alleged that D1 participated in decisions made to approve the Relevant \nLoans . D1 was a member of the Supervisory Board, but none of the Relevant Loans \n \n70  D1 Defence/7(2) {A1/8/4 -5}.

Accordingly, the Bank must resort to allegations that because of his alleged control \nof the Bank and of the corporate entities involved in the transactions between the \nRelevant Drawdowns and the Unreturned Prepayments it should be inferred that \nD1 was responsible for acts which must have been performed with the intention of \ncausing the Bank loss.  \nD1(3)  D1’s Alleged  Ownership and Control of the Corporate Actors  \nD1(3)(a)  The Allegations  \n94. In support of the inferences for which it contends, the Bank alleges that D1 a nd D2 \nbetween them owned and/or controlled all the corporate entities involved in the \ntransactions between the Relevant Drawdowns and the Unreturned Prepayments.76  \n95. The Bank contends that D1 and D2 controlled the Relevant Borrowers through \nPrydniporovsky Business Centre LLC  (“PBC ”) – formerly Privat Busines s Centre \n– alleging that D1 and D2 owned and/or controlled PBC and that its officers and \nemployees acted on D1 and D2’s direct or indirect instructions, including “ causing \nthem to enter into written agreem ents and transfer funds .”77 \n96. The Bank alleges that D1 and D2 controlled the Defendant Suppliers and their \nAlleged Principals th rough Primecap Cyprus Limited ( “Primecap ”), alleging that \nD1 and D2 owned and/or controlled Primecap  and that its officers and employees \nacted on D1 and D2’s direct or indirect instructions, including “ causing them to \nenter into written agreements; execute other documents such as letters and transfer \nfunds. ”78 \n \n74  D1 Defence/7(2)(b)(ii)b { A1/8/5}  \n75  BankOpening/202 {AA2/1/93 } \n76  Namely, t he Relevant Borrowers;  the Intermediary Borrowers;  the Defendant Suppliers;  the Alleged \nPrincipals of the Defendant Suppliers; the Share Pledgors;  the Transferors; and the New Borrowers.  \n77  Claim /12C  {A1/2/ 4} \n78  Claim /12B  {A1/2/4 } \nAA3/1/31\n \n26  D1(3)(b)  D1’s Position  \n97.

D1 admits to an ownership interest in a number of the Rele vant and Intermediate \nBorrowers, and to an ownership interest in or control of a number of Share Pledgors \nand Transferors of some of the Transferred Assets.  He denies control of any of the \nNew Borrowers, the Defendant Suppliers  or their Alleged Principals,  whether \ndirectly or through Primecap or PBC as the case may be.   \n98. For convenience, a summary of D1’s position in relation to the Bank’s allegations of ownership and control are set out in tabular form at Appendix D .  \nD1(3)(c)   The Bank’s Evidence: The Structure Cha rts \n99. The Bank has put together 130 Charts seeking to prove control of various entities \nthrough nominees working for D1 and/or D2 (together, the “ Structure Charts ”). \nThe Structure Charts relate to:  \n(1) the 50 Borrowers;  \n(2) the 34 Intermediary Borrowers;  \n(3) six Defendant Suppliers;  \n(4) three Alleged Principals  of the Defendant Suppliers.  \n100. In addition, the Bank has produced a series of charts identifying 37 nominees who \nthe Bank alleges hold interests or roles on behalf of D1 and D2 (the “ Nominee \nCharts ”).  \n101. D1 denies that the inferences which the Bank invites the Court to draw are either \nnecessary or appropriate .  \n(1) Many of the individuals identified on the Structure Charts were employees of \nPrimecap or other corporate service providers  and these companies did not \nwork exclusively for D1 and D2.  \nAA3/1/32\n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n (2) That some of these individuals perform roles for companies with which D1 \nand D2 are associated does not mean that any  other companies for whom \nthese same individuals perform roles were associated with D1 and D2 too.  \n(3) It goes without saying  that appointment of nominee directors and \nshareholders is common practice in Ukraine  and Cyprus , and  and that the \nsame professional nominees may perform roles in unrelated companies for \nvarious principals. \n102. \nInsofar as necessary, D1 will address that part of the Bank’s case in closing.  In the \nmeantime, D1 makes the following  general points in favour of the exercise of \ncaution in the use of the Charts.  The Bank has now, in Section G of its Opening Submissions, set out the specific \ninferences it seeks to draw in reliance upon the Charts (and various other matters). \n(1) First, the Nominee Charts are not snapshots  reflecting the position at a \nparticular moment in time . They record links  which existed  “across time ” \n(and so present links which did not exist simultaneously). The Structure \nCharts relate to a specific Snapshot Date.  \n(a) Many of the Charts rely on documents from outside the Relevant Period \nand invite the court to infer connections within the Relevant Period. \nWhile D1 does not oppose this approach in general, good evidence is \nrequired for such an inference. As explained below, this is lacking. \nThe Bank often relies on tenuous links from the dist ant past. 79(b) \n(2) Second ly, the Bank relies on dubious evidence for certain connections: \n79 For  example:  The  Viacheslav  Derish ev  chart  {K4-A/8}  seeks  to  draw  t wo  links  between  Mr\nDerishev  and  allegedly  related  com panies.  The  f irst  link  (at  footnote  1)  is  bas ed  solely  on\ndocuments da ted 2004-2008. The second link (at footnote 4) is even more tenuous: it refers only to\na  SMIDA  registry  extract  fr om  2002.  The  Vit aliy  Tyms hyn  chart  {K4-A/30}  relies  on  links  to\nallegedly related companies date d from 2001 to 2008.

For example, a number of \nthe alleged links  rely solely on documents from 2001.81\n(c) The Bank uses unverified YouControl extracts instead of official \nregistry extracts.82 YouControl extracts data from the registry only from \ntime to time and cannot provide specific dates for changes of \nshareholding, so it is not generally considered to be  a reliable source of \ninformation as to ownership history.  \n(d) Similarly, often the documents relied on are not official documents \nshowing ownership (such as deeds of trust), but secondary documents \nprepared by the Bank itself, such as account fact sheets, bank \nquestionnaires or disclosure statements.   \nD1(4)   Acts in the Capacity of a Member of the Supervisory Board \n103. As explained in Section G2  below , for it to have any prospect of establishing \nrelevant wrong -doing on the part of D1, the Bank would need to identify an \nunlawful act or omission committed by D1 in the course of performing his role as \na supervisory board member. There is no evidence of any such wrongdoing. \n80 For  example:  Mitsar  LLC,  fn  12  -  PB0220824,  PB0147229,  PB0147360;  fn  15  -  PB0220824,\nPB0220823,  PB0148575;  Favor e  LLC  {K4-B4/13},  fn  2  -  PB0364661;  fn5  -  PB 0364065;\nCelastrina LLC{K4-B3/5}, fn1 - PB0133982, PB 0344405; Fiastra Trading LLC {K4-B3/14}, fn 1\n- PB0344141, PB0344146, PB 036458 , fn3 - PB0364585\nEmpire LLC {K4-B3/10}, fn 33; Ortika LLC {K4-B3/29}, fn 30, AEF LLC {K4-B/3}, fns 66 and\n67; and ( together with one undated docume nt), Fias tra Trading LLC {K4-B3/14}, fn 2\nFor example, YouControl extr acts are relied on in the f ollowing charts: Podgornov {K4-A/23} –\nfns 1, 2, 4, 5, 12, 21, 22, 24, 25; Zasimenko {K4-A/36} – fns 3, 6, 8; Ivlev {K4-A /11} – fns 1, 2, 3,\n781 \n82 \n28 \n AA3/1/34\n \n29  D2.

He, like D2, will not give \nevidence at trial , nor will any of his witnesses .  \n105. No doubt this decision will be said by the Bank to indicate that D1 is unwilling to “face the music ”. It does nothing of the sort. Instead, it is a reflection of the factual \nand legal deficiencies in the case which the Bank has chosen to bring to this Court.  \nIt will be for the Bank to establish – if it can – the facts on which it relies, and to \npersuade the Court to draw the necessary inferences.

D1’s  Defence turns on the factual inadequacies of the Bank’s case, the \ncontemporaneous documents and the expert evidence. \nE. UKRAINIAN LAW FRAMEW ORK  \n107. The Bank’s claims are brought under Ukrainian law. The Court of Appeal explained in Dexia Crediop SpA v Comune di Prato  [2017] 1 CLC 969 at [34] that “ In the \ncase of disputed questions of foreign law, the task for the trial judge is to determine what the highest relevant court in the foreign legal system would decide if the point \nhad come before it .” \n108. F\nurther, as Foxto n J recently observed in Banca Intesa Sanpaolo SpA v Comune \ndi Venezia  [2022] EWHC 2586 (Comm) at [126]: \n“When it falls to an English court to ascertain the content of foreign \nlaw, that means the law with whatever imperfections, policy -orientated \ndeterminations and impracticalities it manifests, unless the high \nthreshold for non- recognition is satisfied […] T he legal system of \nanother country for these purposes is the picture in the attic, not what \n \n83  Mr Yatsenko {B2/4/1 }, Mr Zavadestskyi { B2/6/1 }, and Mr Medvedev {B2/9/1 } \nAA3/1/35\n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n (to English eyes at least) might seem to be its most idealised \nexpression.” \nUkrainian law is a civilian legal system where the law is codified.84 The legal \nprinciple s of primary significance for this case are found in the Civil Code ( “CC” ), \nwhich was adopted in 2003, as well  as some provisions  of banking and company \nlegislation.  109. \n110. In addition to legislation, Ukrainian courts will also take into account previous \njudgments of the Supreme Court. There is a disagreement between the experts as to \nwhether these judgments are binding within the Ukrainian system ;85 but that does \nnot matter for present purposes , since an English court is entitled to diverge from \neven the highest foreign authority if it is satisfied that it does not represent the law: \nDeutsche Bank AG v Comune di Busto Arsizio  [2021] EWHC 2706 (Comm), \n[106]-[108].  \n111. The Bank’s claim is brought under  Article 1166 CC , which is the general tort law \nprovision and is in the following terms:86\n“Article 1166. General grounds for liability for property damage. \nProperty harm caused by unlawful decisions, actions or omissions to the personal \nnon-property rights of a natural or legal person, as well as harm caused to the \nproperty of a natural or legal person, shall be compensated in full by the person who \ncaused th e harm.  \nThe person who caused the harm shall be exempt from paying compensation if he \nproves that the harm was caused not through his fault […]” \n112. All four experts agree that there are four elements to a cause of action under Article \n1166:87\n(1) Harm; \n(2) Unlawful  conduct; \n84 ULJS/1.1 {C5/1/3}\nULJS/4 {C5/1/4}\nBeketov8 E xhibit: the Ukrainian C ivil Code { C1/6/11}\nULJS/22 {C5/1/13}85 \n86 \n87 \n30 \n AA3/1/36\n \n31  (3) Causation; and \n(4) Fault (i.e. intention or negligence).  \n113. Substantial issues arise in relation to the first three of  these elements , but especially \nthe existence of harm, as foreshadowed in Section A  above. If any or all of the first \nthree elements are not established, there will be no basis upon which to presume \nthe fourth element. \n114. Before turning to the specific issues it is important to appreciate some basic features \nof Ukrainian law.  \n(1) First, as a general matter, Ukrainian commercial law is statute -based and the \nprimary statute, the Civil Code, is only 20 years old.

Before turning to the specific issues it is important to appreciate some basic features \nof Ukrainian law.  \n(1) First, as a general matter, Ukrainian commercial law is statute -based and the \nprimary statute, the Civil Code, is only 20 years old. Accordingly, Ukrainian \nlaw is not just substantively different from English law but also at a much \nearlier stage of its development. For both these reasons, it is wrong to assume \nthat a Ukrainian court would resolve any given legal issue which is not \nspecifically addressed in the codified law in the same way that English \ncommon law has, over the centuries, evolved to do. \n(2) S econdly, the usual way in which fraud and other dishonest conduct i s \nremedied in the Ukrainian legal system is through criminal proceedings.88 \nWhereas the Civil Code has only a single, general tort provision (and nothing \nresembling the complex system of economic torts that English law now has) , \nthe Criminal Code addresses financial misconduct in some detail. It even \nincludes a specific offence of “misappropriation”, which – probably not \ncoincidentally – is the label used by the Bank to characterise D1’s alleged \nmisconduct in this case. It is common ground that in the event of a criminal \nconviction a court can award a civil remedy to the victim of the crime, either \nin the criminal proceedings themselves or in separate civil proceedings. \n \n88  See e.g. Alyoshin1/35 {C2/1/14} : “the obvious and natural way for a claimant in the position of the \nBank to obtain compensation under Ukrainian law in respect of a misappropriation of its funds \nwould be by initiating criminal proceedings and claiming a remedy within those criminal \nproceedings or, following a conviction, in a separate civil claim. ” \nAA3/1/37\n \n32  However, no criminal proceedings have been brought against D1 in relation \nto the allegatio ns made in this case.  \n(3) Thirdly, and relatedly, under Ukrainian law contractual rights and obligations \nhave primacy over tortious ones, such that it is not possible to bring claims in \ntort which are inconsistent with the contractual rights and obligations \nassumed by the parties.89 This concept is not unfamiliar to English law but, \nas shown below, the Ukrainian approach is stricter, and extends to situations \nwhere the defendant to the tortious claim is a stranger to the contract(s).   \n115. The Court will bear these  points in mind when assessing the repeated submissions \non behalf of the Bank that certain propositions of Ukrainian law advanced by D1 \nand Mr Alyoshin are “ surprising ”, “remarkable ”, “unattractive ”, or “strikingly \ndifferent from the English approach” (the last phrase apparently being meant \npejoratively).90 This is parochial and misplaced. Ukrainian law plainly is  different \nfrom English law, as is obvious from even a brief perusal of the many Ukrainian judgments in the trial bundle. Given the features of Ukr ainian law referred to above \n– and particularly the fact that liability for financial misconduct is addressed \nprimarily through criminal rather than civil proceedings – there is nothing \ninherently surprising or unattractive about an interpretation of the l aw that makes it \nmore difficult for a free -standing civil claim to succeed than might be the case under \nEnglish common law or equitable rules. The Bank of course had the opportunity to \nseek to recover damages from D1 by initiating criminal proceedings in Ukraine: in \n \n89  Alyoshin1/173 {C2/1/63}: “There is a generally recognised principle of Ukrainian law that tortious \nliability can usually only exist in the absence of a contractual relationship, and where a contractual \nrelationship exists, the only proper cause of action for harm caused by the non- performance of the \ncontract is contractual in nature. ” \n90  See e.g. BankOpening/416 { AA2/1/172} , 433 { AA2/1/177 }, 4"}

At paragraph 416 \nthe Bank even goes so far as to suggest, citing Brownlie v FS Cairo  [2022] AC 995, that the Court \nshould apply a presumption that Ukrainian law is the same as English law when assessing the evidence of the respective experts, such that whichever expert's views are closer to the English law \nposition should prima facie  be preferred. Although such an approach could only assist D1 ’s \nRepayment Defence, which is undoubtedly correct as a matter of English law, it is a travesty of what Brownlie  decided and clearly to be rejected. The effect of Brownlie  is simply that the Court can  in \nappropriate circumstances apply a presumption that foreign law is the same as English law in the \nabsence of expert evidence on the relevant point ([151]). In the present case the parties have adduced \nvoluminous expert evidence and there are no gaps whi ch need to be filled by the application of a \npresumption. Moreover this would not be an appropriate case for the application of a presumption in any event, having regard to the factors identified at [144] -[147].  \nAA3/1/38\n \n33  electing to pursue a purely civil claim in England instead, it willingly  relinquished \nany procedural advantages that the former course might have offered and accepted \nthe restrictions and limitations that apply to free- standing civil claims unde r \nUkrainian law.  \nF. NO HARM: THE REPAYMENT DEFENC E  \nF1. INTRODUCTION  \n116. It is common ground that all but a small  proportion of the Relevant Drawdowns \nhave been  treated in the Bank’s books as having been repaid, both on the Bank’ s \naccounts and Transactional D ata. \n117. The Bank’s books identify the source of repayment of Relevant Drawdowns as \nbeing either : \n(1) Cash  from Intermediary Loans ( which may be separate loans or further \ndrawdowns under Relevant Loans), or from New Loans; or \n(2) Relevant Loan Transferred Assets.  \n118. Each of these categories of repayments gives rise to distinct issues:  \n119. As regards cash repayments, there is a dispute as to whether the repayments  have \nthe effect of  extinguish ing or reduc ing pro tanto any harm that the Bank suffered \nwhen the Relevant Drawdowns were made.  \n120. As regards repayments by way of T ransferred Assets, it is common ground that the \nBank  must give credit for these , but it is disputed whether the credit should be for \nthe agreed  value of the assets , or only the (in most instances lower) value  which the \nCourt now determines to be the “true ” value.   \n121. These two means of repayment are considered in turn in Sections F2  and F3 below. \nIn the course of the discussion reference is made to the Bank’s case that certain loans are “ void” or “ invalid ”. However,  through the process of exchange of expert \nAA3/1/39\n \n34  evidence,  it has become apparent that its claim  that repayments are to be “ignored”  \nmay not in fact depend on proving that loans are void or should be avoided.91 \nAccordingly, these allegations are addressed separately in Section F 6 below .  \nF2. CASH REPAYMENTS  \n122. Some of the Relevant Loans were repaid by drawdowns under other loans made \nbetween May 2013 and June 2015.92 These are all referred to by the Bank as \n“Intermediary Loans ”. The term is defined93 as those loans  used (in whole or in \npart) to make purported repayments of sums outstanding under Relevant Loans.  \n123.

The term is defined93 as those loans  used (in whole or in \npart) to make purported repayments of sums outstanding under Relevant Loans.  \n123. Importantly:  \n(1) Some of the Intermediary Loans were themselves Relevant Loans.  \n(2) Intermediary Loans are to be distinguished from the New Loans issued in the \ncourse of the Transformation of the Bank’s portfolio in December 2016 which \nrepaid almost all of the outstanding Relevant Loans and Intermediary Loans . \n124. The Bank contends that the Intermediary Loans and the New Loans were not \n“legitimate ” loans, but were made for the purposes of disguising the \nMisappropriation, and that all repayments made by way of Intermediary and New \nLoans therefore “stand to be ignored”  in the context of a claim for tortious damages  \nagainst D1 .94 \n125. This is misconceived. Before explaining why, it is necessary to clear the ground by \nidentifying the nature of the Bank’s case on this crucial issue. It is apparent that the \nBank and its expert, Mr Beketov, have struggled to formulate a coherent position: \nin particular, they have been equivocal and inconsistent as to (1) whether they \ncontend that the Relevant, Intermediary and New L oans (respectively) are invalid, \n \n91  Beketov9/200(b) {C6/1/82}  \n92  See Annex D to the Bank ’s Further Information of 22  May 20 20 {A2/13}  which lists all the \nIntermediary Loans and the various drawdowns under t hem which repaid Relevant Loans.  \n93  Bank ’s Further Information provided on 22  May 20 20 in response to D1’ s RFI dated 21  April 2020 \n{A2/9/2 } \n94  Claim /62(1) {A1/2/34 }; Reply/34 { A1/25/65 } \nAA3/1/40\n \n35  and (2) whether the issues regarding the validity of the various loans make any \ndifference for the purposes of the claim in tort against D1.  \n(1) In its Particulars of Claim the Bank pleads that the Relevant Loans95 and the \nNew Loans96 are void, but only contends that the Intermediary Loans are void \n“To the extent necessary ”.97  \n(2) However, its Reply notes that its agreement to give credit in respect of t he \nvalue of the Transferred Assets is “without prejudice to the Bank’s case that the Relevant and Intermediary Loans are void and/or voidable ”.\n98  \n(3) The Bank does therefore appear to advance a case (albeit not ve ry clearly) \nthat all of the Relevant, Intermediary and New Loans are void  or at least \nvoidable.  \n(4) Mr Beketov prepared seven reports throughout the interlocutory stages of the \nproceedings. In his 8th report  – his main report for trial – i n paragraph 138, he \nsays that where an “ unlawful loan” (“loan 1”) is purportedly repaid using \nanother “ unlawful loan” (“loan 2”) , a Ukrainian court would not treat the \nrepayment of loan 1 as reducing the liability of any third party in tort “ on the \nbasis that in the posited scenario, loan 2 is void”.99 Loan 2 in Mr Beketov’s \nexample corresponds to the Intermediary/New Loans, not the Relevant Loans, \nwhich correspond to Loan 1. Mr Beketov was therefore saying that repayments of Relevant Loans using Intermediary/New Loans would f all to \nbe ignored because the Intermediary/New Loans  were void. He did not  (at \nany rate expressly)  rely on the Relevant Loans  being void. \n(5) This appears to be the position now adopted in the Bank’s Opening, where it is contended (in purported reliance on Mr Beketov) that the Repayment \n \n95  Claim /32A {A1/2/23}  \n96  Claim /62(1A) {A1/2/34}  \n97  Claim /62(1) {A1/2/34 } \n98  Reply/27G.2 {A1/25/43}  \n99  Beketov8/138 {C1/1/45}  \nAA3/1/41\n \n36  Defence is not a valid defence because the Intermediary and New Loans are \nvoid.100 \n(6) In the Joint Statement, howev er, Mr Beketov expressed the relevant principle \nin a way that is not (or not clearly) dependent on any of the loans being void.

Mr Beketov did not \nexplain, eit her in the Joint Statement or in his 9th report, precisely what he \nmeant by “unlawful ” in this context, and whether it was intended to denote \nthe loans being void/voidable, or whether some other test of “ lawfulness ” \napplied . However, it appears that he con templates a situation in which both \nthe Relevant Loans and the Intermediary Loans  are the result  of some \nunlawful conduct but are  not necessarily  void.  \n(7) In Beketov9/200,102 Mr Beketov focuses on the status of the Relevant Loans, \narguing that if the Relevant Loans are void then there is no contractual \nobligation to be discharged.103 Importantly, however, Mr Beketov , goes on to \nadd that “ I would reach the same conclusion if the court concludes that the \nRelevant Loans  are not void, but nevertheless finds that they  were the product \nof the Defendants’ unlawful (and tortious) conduct causing harm to the \nBank ”.104 \n126. These various propositions of Mr Beketov will need to be explored to some extent in cross-examination.  \n127. What can however be said at this stage is that Mr Beket ov is correct in his (belated) \nacceptance that , in terms of the Bank’s claim against D1, it makes no difference \n \n100  BankOpening/549(1) {AA2/1/214} \n101  ULJS/46.1 {C5/1/20} \n102  Beketov9/200 {C6/1/82} \n103  Beketov9/200(a)(i) {C6/1/82}  \n104  Beketov9/200(b)  {C6/1/82}  \nAA3/1/42\n \n37  whether the Relevant Loans are valid, voidable or void. (And, although Mr Beketov \ndoes not expressly say so, the same point applies equally to t he Intermediary and \nNew Loans.)  \n(1) It is common ground that a  loan which is void (or has been avoided) still gives \nrise to obligations on the part of the borrower/recipient to the \nlender/transferor, specifically a restitutionary liability to repay the funds it \nreceived.105 \n(2) Consequently , whether the loans are valid or void, the crediting of the \nRelevant Borrower’s accounts  discharged the ir liability to the Bank arising \nout of those Loans. The Bank (rightly) does not appear to contend that , \nbecause the Relevant Loans are void, the Relevant Borrowers still have \noutstanding liabilities in connection with the loans , such that the repayments \nwere not even effective to reduce any claims which the Bank had against the \nRelevant Borrowers . Its own books are inconsistent with any such suggestion, \nas is the Bank’s approach in giving credit in situations where one Relevant Loan was used to repay another.  \n128. The issue that arises is therefore not whether any of the loans are valid , void or \nvoidable but a different one, namely whether the repayment of the Relevant \nBorrowers’ liabilities (be they contractual or restitutionary) “ stands to be ignored” \nfor the purpose of assessing whether the Bank can be said to have suffered harm for which it is entitled to be  compensated via a tort claim against a third party. As Mr \nBeketov puts it, the core issue is whether the repayments “ in fact discharged (or \nreduced) the Defendants’ liability in tort for the harm caused by the \nMisappropriation”.\n106   \n129.

While the Bank and Mr B eketov have always maintained that there is a principle of \nUkrainian law which allows repayments of Relevant Loans to be “ ignored” or \n“disregarded” for the purposes of assessing the loss in this claim, they have again \nnot been clear or consistent in the wa y the principle is expressed:  \n \n105  ULJS/5.7 {C5/1/5 }; Alyoshin1/79 {C2/1/27 }, referring to Article 216(1) CC { C2/8/5 }  \n106  Beketov9/200(a)(ii) {C6/1/82 } \nAA3/1/43\n \n38  (1) The Bank’s pleaded case is that the repayments can be ignored because the \nIntermediary Loans and the New Loans , from which they derived, were not \n“legitimate ”.107  \n(2) Mr Beketov does not endorse a test of “ legitimacy ” (there being  no such \nconcept in Ukrainian law).108 Instead he describes the test as being whether \nthe repayments were referable to “other unlawful lending” – by which he \nappears to mean that both the Relevant Loans and the Intermediary Loans are void – or whether they resulted from D1’s “ unlawful conduct ”.\n109  \n130. Accordingly, the Repayment Defence potentially gives rise to the following core \nissues:  \n(1) First, is there any  basis under Ukrainian law on which the repayments of \nRelevant Loans can be “ ignored” or “ disregarded ”?  \n(2) S econdly, insofar as material, are the Relevant Loans and Intermediary Loans \nvoid?  \n(3) T hirdly , again insofar as material, did the Loans result from unlawful conduct \non behalf of D1?  \n131. This section addresses the first of these issues , which D1 will submit is dispositive \nof this aspect of the case and, indeed, the majority of the Bank’s claim . The second \nissue is most clearly of  relevance in relation to the Asset Transfers but is addressed \nin Section F6 below . It also requires consideration of the applicability of the \nprinciple prohibiting inconsistent conduct ( venire contra factum  proprium ) \naddressed in Section F7(1) below. The third issue is identical to that raised by the \nNo Unlawful Conduct Defence, and is considered in Section  G.  \n \n107  Claim /62(1) {A1/2/34 }, Reply/27B.3  {A1/25/3 6}; Reply/35.2 { A1/25/6 6} \n108  Alyoshin1/141 {C2/1/52 } \n109  Beketov9/200(a)(iii) {C6/1/82 }; ULJS/46.1 { C5/1/20} \nAA3/1/44\n \n39  F2(1)  Can the repayments of Relevant Loans be ignored?  \n132. According to the analysis of Mr Beketov, a separate tort is committed each time a \nperson procures money under an unlawful loan.110 This is common ground.  \n133. Nevertheless, Mr Beketov contends that where one unlawfully obtained drawdown is used to repay a previous unlawfully obtained drawdown, it does not operate to \nreduce or extinguish the loss that arises upon the earlier drawdown. Instead, in his \nview:\n111 \n“… the victim in such a scenario can choose which unla wful loan ( i.e. which tort) to \nsue upon, with the loss caused by each tort being equal to the amount of the unlawful \nloan less any genuine compensation received in relation to that tortious loss; \nhowever, the victim would not be permitted to double recover …”  \n134. Mr Beketov himself accepts112 that this position is not supported by any Ukrainian \nlegislation or court practice. So far as D1 can tell, it appears to have been developed \nspecifically to cater for  the unusual situation that arises in this case, where the  Bank \nhas elected to confine its claims to Relevant Drawdowns which have been repaid, and has eschewed any claim in relation to the transactions which were the source \nof the repayments, i.e. the New Loans and the Asset Transfer.   \n135.

D1’s position is simple:  \n(1) The Bank claims to have suffered loss as a result of making particular \nadvance s of funds – Relevant Drawdown s. \n(2) When a Relevant Drawdown is repaid (by whatever means), any loss caused \nby it is reduced or extinguished.\n113  \n \n110  Beketov9/200(b) {C6/1/82 }, referring to “an earlier misappropriation and a later \nmisappropriation”.

Accordingly, the Bank’s claim must fail. \n136. D1’s position is correct, whereas the Bank’s position is wrong.  \n \n114  Alyoshin1/130 {C2/1/47 }. Article 1049(3) provides that “ The loan shall be deemed repaid at the \ntime of… crediting the amount borrowed to [the borrower ’s] bank account ” {C2/8/11 -12} \n115  Alyoshin1/79 {C2/1/27}  \nAA3/1/46\n \n41  137.

Toulson  J held that the fact that the \nproceeds of an LC had been used to repay liabilities in relation to earlier LCs did not diminish the Bank’s loss, because:  \n“Each time the bank accepted fraudulently presented documents, it accepted \nliability under a separate  LC; but with that liability went the benefit of a right \nto reimbursement by BCL. If the bank received such reimbursement from or on \nbehalf of BCL, that would extinguish the bank ’s loss in respect of that \ntransaction, whatever the derivation of the funds may have been. So, if the \nproceeds of LC No. 2 were used to reimburse the bank in respect of LC No. 1, \nthat would extinguish the bank’ s loss in respect of LC No. 1.  In this regard the \nidentity of the beneficiary under the LCs is immaterial. Conversely, if the bank \ndid not receive such reimbursement in respect of LC No. 2, its loss in respect \nof that LC remains. ”117 \n(2) Similarly,  in Yurov , the claimant bank alleged that the former majority \nowners of a Russian bank had procured the bank to make loans totalling USD 1 billion to companies which they controlled as part of a scheme to extract \nmoney from the bank for their benefit. The defendants argued that they had \nno liability to the bank because the impugned loans had been used to repay \nexisting bad debts and tha t in repaying those debts, the existing loss to the \nbank had been refinanced and deferred. \n \n116  Yurov  at [1195]  \n117  Yurov  at [168]  \nAA3/1/47\n \n42  (3) Adopting the reasoning in Komer ční Banka , Bryan J explained at [1194] \nwhy the argument was wrong: \n“It is not right as it looks only at the Bank ’s net financial posit ion, ignores the \nfact that the earlier loan has in fact been repaid and fails to analyse whether the \nfraudulent conduct in fact caused the loss with which the Bank is left. The fallacy and sleight -of-hand is that what is obscured is the fact that when \nwron gfully obtained money is used to repay the initial loan, the original loan \nloss is not “deferred ”, it is extinguished. What subsists, is the loss caused by \nthe fraud not the original lending. This loss (even if in the same amount) is a \ndifferent loss caused by a different event  and in many cases (as in the example \nthat involves B as well as A) caused by, and recoverable from, someone else. ” \n(4) D1’s expert, Mr Alyoshin, agrees that the analysis in Yurov  is compelling \nand says that the result would be the same under Ukrainian Law. He rightly \nconsiders that it is a complete answer to Mr Beketov’s contention specifically \nbecause of the confirmation that, compared to the loss caused by the original \nloan which is repaid, the loss caused by the subsequent loan is a “ different \nloss caused by a different event ”,118 and cannot be recovered by way of a \nclaim under the original loan. The loss caused by the second loan can only  be \nthe subject of a claim in respect of that loan, identifying the unlawful act alleged to have caus ed that loss.\n119 \n138. Secondly , the English law position must be correct in principle because it makes no \nsense to divorce the position of the borrower who received an allegedly unlawful \nloan from that of a third party who is liable for procuring the loan.  \n(1) If  th e loan has been repaid, such that the borrower’s liability has been \ndischarged, by definition  there is no loss for which a third party can sensibly \nbe held liable.  \n(2) The Bank contends that the repayments of Relevant Loans using credit \nunlawfully procured from the Bank did not reduce its loss “ overall ”,120 but in \nmaking that point, the Bank confuses the quantification of its so- called \n“overall"}

Thirdly , while Mr Beketov seeks to justify his view by reference to general \n“principles of justice, reasonableness and fairness ”, there is in fact no principled \nreason to adopt it. To the contrary, broad considerations of justice etc. plainly do not require that a victim should be able to choose to sue a defendant for procuring \na loan which has been repaid, as opposed to suing for  procuring the loan which was \ntaken out to repay it.121 They do not so require because the victim can simply sue \non whichever loan remain unpaid so as to have caused a loss. Alternatively, it can sue on all the loans and recover the total unpaid balance.\n122 There is no reason why \na victim should be permitted to sue only on loans which it knows have been repaid \nand thereby recover damages for loss which has not been suffered.  \n(1) Mr Beketov seeks to draw support from supposed principles of “ protecting \nvictims’ property rights ” and the need to ensure a victim receives “full \ncompensation”;123 but this is unconvincing, not least because it begs the \nquestion of whether there is any loss arising from the Relevant Loans which \nremains to be compensated. The principle that losses should be compensated is inherent in any legal system and has no independent normative force over \nand above the specific rules applicable to tort claims. It certainly does not \nrequire a claimant to be permitted to recover damages in respect of an act that \nhas caused no loss, when it could instead have brought a legally correct claim \nin respect of a different act that did cause it loss, but chose not to do so.  \n(2) Mr Beketov imagines a “perverse incentive ”\n124 arising for a second loan to \nbe taken out in orde r to hide the first if repayment of the first by a second \nunlawful loan would extinguish the cause of action arising from the first; but \n \n121  Alyoshin2/28  {C7/1/12}  \n122  This is no different, analytically, from suing only on the loans which remain outstanding.  \n123  Beketov9/200(h)(ii) {C6/1/85 }  \n124  ULJS/ 46.1 { C5/1/20}  \nAA3/1/49\n \n44  this is an imaginary difficulty. There is in reality no incentive at all: in the \ncontemplated scenario, the tortfeasor has replaced the victim’s cause of action \non the first loan with a cause of action on the second. The victim is no worse \noff. It is not suggested that the second tort would be any harder to detect than \nthe first, nor is there any reason why it should be.125 \n140. Fourthly , Mr Beketov’s analysis cannot be right because the losses caused by the \nrespective torts are not (or not necessarily) the same, so the claims and losses are \nnot interchangeable. This is not just a conceptual problem but also a practical one. \nSuppose for example that a worthless Relevant Loan is repaid and replaced by a \nNew Loan to a solvent borrower which is able to repay it and against which a \njudgment could easily be enforced, if necessary. The loss caused by the New Loan \nis self -evidently smalle r than the amount of the Relevant Loan and there may even \nbe no loss at all.

This is not just a conceptual problem but also a practical one. \nSuppose for example that a worthless Relevant Loan is repaid and replaced by a \nNew Loan to a solvent borrower which is able to repay it and against which a \njudgment could easily be enforced, if necessary. The loss caused by the New Loan \nis self -evidently smalle r than the amount of the Relevant Loan and there may even \nbe no loss at all. For the Bank to recover the full amount of the Relevant Loan on the basis that the repayment was to be “disregarded”, would result in the Bank \nbeing hugely overcompensated. Mr Alyoshin is therefore correct to point out that \nthe Bank’s theory, if correct, would present a clear risk of double recovery.\n126 Mr \nBeketov has no answer to this beyond the glib statement that “ courts have no \ndifficulty ensuring that claimants do not double rec over”.127 He does not explain \nhow this could be avoided if his theory about “ disregarding” repayments were right.  \n141. Fifthly , the practical difficulties inherent in the Bank’s approach are not limited to \nissues of double recovery. Contrary to the Bank’s submission at BankOpening/544 \n{AA2/1/213}, it is the Bank’s approach, not D1’s, which requires the Court to \n“unravel a complex web ”128 of dealings:  \n(1) On D1’s approach, where a defendant procures a series of loans, each of \nwhich is used to repay the preceding loan, the loss is straightforwardly the \n \n125  Alyoshin2/42  {C7/1/18}  \n126  Alyoshin2/34  {C7/1/15}  \n127  Beketov9/200(f) {C6/1/84}  \n128  The quote from Komer ční Banka  in this paragraph is taken out of context: Toulson J ’s observation \nwas in the context of rejecting what is referred to in these proceedings as the Use of Funds Defence,  \nnot the Repayment Defence which is entirely different.  \nAA3/1/50\n \n45  unreturned balance of the final loan in the series. There is no need to \n“unravel ” anything.  \n(2) By contrast it is the Bank’s approach that necessitates a convoluted analysis of the sources from which each loan in the series was repaid, in order to \nidentify the ultimate source of each repayment and whether each repayment \nis to be taken into account in measuring the Bank’s loss or whether it is \ninstead to be “ disregarded”. The scale and complexity of the work undertaken \nby the forensic accounting experts, Mr Thompson and Mr Davidson, in this regard , and the disagreements between them, speak for themselves . None of \nthat work would have been necessary and no such disagreements would have \narisen if the Bank had simply brought a claim in respect of the New Loans. \n142. Properly analysed, therefore, what the Bank is really complaining about is that \nwhen each Relevant Loan was repaid it was caused another loss by a \nmisappropriation of funds under an Intermediary Loan or a New Loan. While those losses are different and arose from different wrongful acts, the amount by which \nthe loss under the Relevant Loans was reduced is the same as, or no greater than, \nthe amount of the new loss. As a result, the Bank was no better off for the \nrepayment.  \n143. However, this is not how the Bank’s case has been pleaded. The pleaded case is \nexplicitly confined – for deliberate tactical reasons – to loss caused by the Relevant \nLoans. That is the loss in respect of which the Bank asserts a cause of action. It is \nnot open to the Bank now to claim for loss caused to it by the Intermediary or New \nLoans, nor does it do so; yet that is the only way in which it could properly recover \ndamages for any loss it has actually suffered following the repayment of the \nRelevant Loans.  \n144. As it is, the repayment of the Relevant Loans extinguished any loss  which the Bank \nsuffered , and therefore any claims  that arose, when the Relevant Drawdowns took \nplace, and not only its claims against Relevant Borrowers.

Finally, it should be noted that some Intermediary Loans were themselves repaid in \ncircumstances which the Bank accepts were not per se illegitimate or unlawful so \nthat th e repayments  of Relevant Loans funded by such Intermediary Loans  could \nnot, even on the Bank’s case, be ignored or disregarded – for example, where \nIntermediary Loan s were repaid by way of Asset Transfer.   \n146. The Bank implicitly accepts , as it must,  that it cannot claim to have suffered any \nloss insofar as Relevant Loans were repaid using Intermediary Loans which were \nthemselves repaid  (in its terminology)  “legitimately ”.129 However , the complexity \nof the analysis that this approach requires (to the extent i t is possible to conduct a \nmeaningful analysis at all) only underlines the fallaciousness of the proposition that \nrepayments of Relevant Loans can be “ ignored ” in particular circumstances. The \ncorrect position is that repayments reduce the Bank’s loss and, if the source of the \nrepayments is other unlawful lending, the Bank has a claim to recover the separate \nloss that arises as a result of that unlawful lending. There is no need to strain against \nthis natural conclusion.130 The only reason that the Bank has to do so is to overcome \nthe difficulties caused by  its decision to sue only in respect of the  Misappropriation \nof funds advanced under  Relevant Loans and not in respect of any funds drawn \ndown under other loans or alleged overvaluations of assets. \nF2(3)  Conclusio n \n147. For all the above reasons, D1 will submit that the Repayment Defence is correct in \nprinciple and as a matter of Ukrainian law and should be upheld, with the result that \nthe claim should be dismissed to the extent that Relevant Loans are recorded in the \nBank’s books as having been repaid in cash.  \n129 Reply/27B.3 { A1/25/36}\nMr Alyoshin points out at Alyoshin1/141 {C2/1/52} that “a principle whereby a creditor could\nchoose to “ignore” the payment of a debt depending on t he origin of the funds used to make the\npayment w ould lead to serious commercial uncertainty.”130 \n46 \n AA3/1/52\n \n47  F3. DIRECT REPAYMENTS BY ASSET TRANSFERS  \n148. It is common ground that Asset Transfer is an effective means of repayment of \nRelevant Loans and that such repayments do in principle reduce the loss that can \nbe recovered by  the Bank against any third party in tort.  \n149. There are disputes , however, as to the amount of credit to be given for the \nTransferred Assets.  \n150. The Bank’s position is that the value of the Transferred Assets did not justify the \nCredit Values and that, in assessing damages, D1 should not receive the benefit of the credits in fact granted by the Bank to various Relevant Borrowers in its books \nbut rather a reduced amount reflecting the value (or a reduced amount calculated on a pro rata basis) of the Transferred Assets at the time they were received , now \nascribed to them by the valuation experts in these proceedings (the so -called “true ” \nvalue) . \n151. This gives rise to two broad issues: \n(1) First, can the Bank ignore the Credit Values and give credit only for the true \nvalue of the Transferred Assets ?

The legal issue as to the status of the agreed valuations is dealt with here. The issues \nas to the “true” values of the  assets, if they arise, are addressed in Section K below.  \nF3(1)  The Bank’s Accounting for Credit Values  \n153. The Bank accounted for repayment of loans by Asset Transfer as follows:131 \n \n131  Davidson1/4.11 {D2/1/18} \nAA3/1/53\n \n48  (1) Where loans (including Relevant Loans and Intermediary Loans ) were not \nrepaid entirely in cash, the outstanding loan balances were transferred to an \noverdue loan account.  \n(2) Transferred Assets received by the Bank were recorded by the Bank in its account for “ Property that was transferred into the bank’s ownership in its \ncapacity as pledgee ” (the 3409 account), with a corresponding amount \nentered in the Bank’s account of “ Other accounts payable on operations with \nbank customers ” (the 2909 account).  \n(3) The loan amount to be repaid was transferred from the overdue loan acco unt \nto the 2909 account and from there to the account with the borrower whose loan was repaid.  \n154. The amounts recorded by the Bank in its T ransactional Data as the value of the \nTransferred Assets (i.e. the Credit Values) are the amounts which were then applie d \nto the repayment of loans. The value of most of those Transferred Assets had previously been agreed (or verified) by the NBU pursuant to the Tripartite \nAgreements discussed in Appendix B  hereto . \n155. Repayments by Asset Transfer occurred in batches of transactions involving the \ntransfer of Transferred Assets in tranches to repay one or more loans (in full or in part) on a particular day.  \n156. Repayments of Relevant Loans and Intermediary Loans by Asset Transfer are particularised in Schedules 2 and 2A to D1’ s Defence respectively .\n132 \nF3(2)  Ignoring the Credit Value if the Mortgage Agreement is Void  \n157. It is common ground that, if the loan or loan s secured by a Mortgage Agreement \nare void, the Mortgage Agreement is also void and, in that case,  the Credit Value \n \n132  D1 Defence, Schedules 2 { A1/11/1 }, 2A { A1/12/1}  \nAA3/1/54\n \n49  can be ign ored.133 This is the effect of Article 548(2) CC, which provides that the \ninvalidity of a secured obligation results in the invalidity of the security.134  \n158. Thus the one  question which potentially needs to be determined is whether , in the \ncase of each Mortgage Agreement, the corresponding loans are void: see Section \nF6 below.  \n159. D1 contends,135 however, that it is simply not open to the Bank even to argue  that \nthe loans or the Mortgage Agreements are void, in circumstances where the Bank \nhas consistently treated the loans and Mortgage Agreements as valid, has accepted \nthe Transferred Assets by way of repayment of the loans, has participated in a significant number of Ukrainian court proceedings in relation to the loans and \nMortgage Agreements without ever suggesting that they were not valid, and \navowedly has no intention of returning the assets to the transferors  (as it would be \nobliged to do if the Mortgage Agreements were void) . In these circumstances, the \nBank’s reversal of its position for the purposes (and only the purposes) of these \nproceedings is contrary to the Ukrainian law principle of venire contra factum \nproprium  (which prohibits inconsistent conduct) and/or the English law doctrine of"}

The Bank advances a number of distinct arguments (all of which are disputed by \nD1) as to why the Credit Values can be ignored even if the Mortgage Agreements \nare valid.  \n161. First, the Bank maintains that the state of account between it and the secured \nborrowers is separate from the assessment of its loss.136 The Bank is thus effectively \ncontending that in assessing the loss caused to it by the making of the Relevant Drawdowns, credit should be given only for the true value of the Transferred \n \n133  ULJS/51.1 { C5/1/22} ; D1 Defence/41(9 -11) { A1/8/24} \n134  ULJS/52.1 {C5/1/22} ; Alyoshin1/146- 147 {C2/1/53 } \n135  D1 Defence/88 { A1/8/53}  \n136  Reply/27F.7.1 { A1/25/41}  \nAA3/1/55\n \n50  Assets, and the state of the account between the Bank and any borrowe r or \nmortgagor is irrelevant. Mr Beketov explains the argument as follows:  \n “… the quantification of the Bank ’s loss resulting from the Misappropriation, \nincluding any reduction to that loss by the value of assets transferred to the Bank in \npurported repay ment of the Relevant/Intermediary Loans, would fall to be assessed \nas a matter of fact ”137  \n“… the Bank ’s loss resulting from the Misappropriation should be reduced by the \nasset ’s true value at the time of their acquisition, which would be a matter of fact t o \nbe determined by way of valuation evidence.”138  \n“… any reduction calculated with reference to an inflated value would result in the \nBank receiving less than full compensation ”139 \n162. Mr Alyoshin disagrees  with this analysis . As he points out, it assumes the ver y thing \nit needs to prove, namely that the agreed Credit Values are to be ignored when \nconsidering what loss the Bank has suffered and for which it is entitled to be \ncompensated.140 \n163. Simply stated, t he Bank’s loss arising from the Relevant Drawdowns i s necess arily \nequal to the unpaid balance (if any) of the Relevant Drawdowns : it cannot be \ngreater. Since the Bank agreed to credit the Borrowers with the Credit Value of the \nTransferred Assets , its loss has necessarily reduced by that amount . If the Bank \nwished t o contend that the Credit Values were too low , it could and should have \ntaken steps to challenge the agreed valuations,141 and adjusted the accounts with the \nborrowers, but it did not do so. In those circumstances , it is inconsistent, illogical, \nand impermissible, for the Bank to credit the Borrowers with the Credit Values without giving an equivalent amount of credit to D1.  \n164.

Secondly, the Bank pleads that , irrespective of the value of the Transferred Asset s \nas stated in the Mortgage Agreement s, “pursuant to NBU Resolution 23 dated 25 \nJanuary 2012 (and from 3 January 2017, NBU Resolution 351), the Bank as mortgagee was required to treat any asset which is mortgaged in its favour at the \nasset’s true value .”\n143 Mr Beketov supports this argument at Beketov 8/155- 160 \n{C1/1/50}.  \n166. D1’s response is as follows : \n(1) Resolution 23 did not impose any binding obligation on the Bank; while \nResolution 351 did not come into force until 3 January 2017, as the Bank \nacknowledges.144  \n(2) Further, and in any event, the NBU Resolutions are regulatory measures \napplicable to the Bank: the only implication of the Bank’s case is therefore \nthat it failed to comply with the NBU’s requirements when it credited the Borrowers with the Credit Values of the Transferred Assets . That does not \naffect the validity of any transactions or valuations, nor can it provide any rational basis for assessing damages by reference to the true values of the \nassets as opposed to the Credit Values. \n(3) On the assumption that the Bank would have sought to comply with  \nRegulation  351, insofar as it has not altered the credit granted in respect of \n \n142  Reply/28F {A1/25/51} \n143  Reply/27F.7.2 { A1/25/42}  \n144  Alyoshin2/243- 245 {C2/1/81 } \nAA3/1/57\n \n52  them in its accounts this would suggest that it accepts that the Credit Values \nare the true values .   \n167. Thirdly, the Bank contends that, as controllers of the Transferors who procured the \nover- valuation of the Transferred Assets, D1 and D2 cannot rely on the Credit \nValues because it would be an “abuse of rights contrary to Article 13 UCC ” for \nthem to be permitted to do so.145 This is, again, a very dubious proposi tion:  \n(1) The doctrine of “ abuse of rights ” is not as wide -ranging as Mr Beketov \nclaims , and there is no example of it  being applied in these or analogous \ncircumstances . In particular, it only makes sense to refer to the abuse of a \nright if it is possible to say what right is being abused. Neither the Bank nor \nMr Beketov has identified any relevant right  that D1 is supposedly abusing \nby pointing out that the Bank is bound by the Credit Values in the Mortgage \nAgreements .146 \n(2) D1 and D2 are not relying on the Credit  Values as such , but on the credits \napplied to the B orrowers’ accounts by the Bank, which the Bank is unwilling \nto adjust . If anything, it is actually the Bank  which is abusing its rights , and/or \nacting  contrary to the venire  principl e, and/or approbating and reprobating, \nby arguing that transactions are void and/or that repayments have not been \nmade when the repayments are recorded in its books and the argument that \nthey are to be ignored is entirely inconsistent with its prior conduct.147 \n168.

INDIRECT REPAYMENTS B Y SUBSEQUENT LOANS O R ASSET TRANSFERS  \n169. As noted above, Intermediary Loans were themselves ultimately repaid by either \nAsset Transfer or the issue of New Loans or by some other means. If the Bank is \nright  that repayments of Relevant Drawdowns using funds derived from \nIntermediary Loans are to be “ disregarded ”, then it is common ground that :  \n(1) the repayment of Intermediary Loans by New Loans will make no difference; \nbut \n(2) the Bank can not ignore the repayments funded by an Intermediary Loan \ninsofar as the Intermediary Loan was itself repaid  by an Intermediary Loan \nTransferred Asset .148 \nF5. REPAYMENTS OF INTERMEDIARY LOANS FROM UNIDENTIFI ED SOURCES  \n170. Where Intermediary Loans were repaid by funds fr om an unidentified source, the \nBank refuses to give credit for the repayments  (see Section M6 below).149 It is \nunclear what might be the legal basis for its position. The proposition is not \njustifiable and the Bank has not sought to justify it. It can only be intending the \nCourt to infer that if D1 cannot demonstrate that funds came from outside the Bank \nit should be assumed that they came from other unlawful lending which the Bank \nhas been unable to identify. That is an attempt to reverse the burden of proof . \n171. It is for the Bank to prove that it has suffered a loss. In circumstances where its own  \nbooks  credit the Borrowers with repayment of the Relevant Loans and its own \nFinancial Statements treat the Relevant Loans as repaid, the starting point must be that the repayments must reduce the Bank’s loss unless the Bank can demonstrate \nthat they should be ignored. It cannot be for D1 to prove the negative  proposition \nthat there is no basis upon which the Bank can impugn the payments. \n \n148  Reply/27B.2 {A1/25/36}  \n149  See Thompson3/4.139- 140 { D1/440/63}  \nAA3/1/59\n \n54  F6. ARE THE LOANS VOID ?  \n172. It follows  from the above analysis that the Bank is fixed with the Credit Values \nunless it is able to show that the loans secured by the mortgages, and therefore the \nmortgages themselves, are void. Although the position is unclear, it may also be \nnecessary for its case that Relevant Drawdowns have not been “validly repaid ” to \ndemonstrate that Relevant, Intermediary and /or New Loans are void.  \n173. The Bank contends that there are four grounds on which Relevant Loans, \nIntermediary Loans or New Loans are void, namely:  \n(1) That the Loans are sham transactions within Article 235 CC. \n(2) That the Loans are contrary to public policy within Article 228 CC.  \n(3) That the Loans were made to related parties o n non- market terms, contrary to  \nArticle 52 of the Law on Banks.  \n(4) That the Loans we re unauthorised significant transactions, contrary to Article \n70 of the Law on Joint Stock Companies (the “ JSC Law ”).  \n174.

The Bank claims that the various contracts were made in order to disguise the \nMisappropriation and should therefore be treated as sham/mock transactions153 \nunder Article 235 CC, and as being void.154 \n177. This is wrong. Article 235 provides (in Mr Beketov’s translation):155  \n“1. A transaction shall be  sham if it has been concluded by the parties for the purposes  \nof concealing another transaction, which they actually concluded. \n2. In case it is established that the transaction has been concluded by the parties to \nconceal another transaction, which they actually concluded, the relations between \nthe parties shall be governed by the rules applicable to such actual transaction. ” \n178. Sham/mock transactions are to be distinguished from “ fictitious ” transactions, \nwhich are defined in Article 234 CC as transactions “ made without an intention to \ncreate the legal consequences stipulated by the transaction”.156  \n179. In particular:  \n(1) A fictitious transaction is one where the parties do not intend to create the \nrights and obligations described in the contract at all.  Such a tran saction is \nliable to be declared invalid.157  A fictitious transaction is  therefore  somewhat  \nanalogous to a sham contract as that term is understood in English law ,158 \nnevertheless, the Bank does not allege that any of the loans in this case were fictitious tr ansactions within Article 234. \n(2) A sham/mock transaction under Article 235 is concerned with a lawful type \nof transaction, which is the subject of specific provisions in the Civil Code, \nbeing disguised as another lawful type of transaction – for example, a s ale \nbeing dressed up as a gift. The consequence of a contract being found to be \n \n153  Mr Beketov translates the Ukrainian удаваний ( udavaniy ) as “ sham ”; Mr Alyoshin prefers the term \n“mock”. The Court need not decide between these translations.  \n154  Claim/32A {A1/2/23} ; Beketov8/41- 45 {C1/1/13} \n155  { C1/6/7 } \n156  Alyoshin1/94 {C2/1/34}  \n157  Article 234(2) { C2/1/34 } \n158  See Snook v London & West Riding Investments [1967] 2 QB 786  \nAA3/1/61\n \n56  sham/mock is not (or not necessarily) that the contract is invalid. Instead, the \nCourt applies the rules that are applicable to the type of transaction the parties \nintended to make, as opposed the type of transaction that it purports to be.159 \n180. Article 235 cannot be applied to invalidate a loan agreement which is entered into to “disguise ” a “misappropriation”.\n160   \n181. A “misappropriation” is not a type of contract subject to particular  rules, as in the \ncase of (for example) a sale, a lease, a contract of insurance etc. To the contrary, \nmisappropriation is a form of criminal conduct, regulated by the criminal law. \nArticle 235 therefore cannot apply in this situation at all.161 \n182. Further, and in any event, Article 235 does not itself invalidate contracts at all (in \ncontrast to Article 234).

In any event, it appears that Mr Beketov relies on Article 235 not as an independent \nprovision but only “ in conjunction with Article 228”.163 Article 228 is concerned \nwith invalid transactions contrary to public policy and is addressed below. It is \ncommon ground that, if the loans were entered into for a purpose contrary to public \npolicy then Article 228 will apply. Accordingly, Article 235 is irrelevant, or at best \nredundant, and does not need to be considered further.164  \n \n159  Alyoshin1/97 {C2/1/35} ; Alyoshin2/189- 191 {C7/1/66 } \n160  Alyoshin1/92 -103 {C2/1/33}  \n161  Alyoshin1/103 {C2/1/37 }; Alyoshin2/195 {C7/1/67}  \n162  Beketov8/42 {C1/1/13} ; ULJS/14 { C5/1/10}  \n163  Beketov8/45 {C1/1/14}  \n164  Alyoshin2/196 {C7/1/67 } \nAA3/1/62\n \n57  F6(3)  Public policy: Article 228 CC  \n184. The Bank alleges that contracts involved in the transactions from Relevant Loans \nto Relevant Supply Agreements are contrary to public policy on the ground that \nthey were designed to cause harm to the Bank  and are therefore void under Article \n228 CC.165 \n185. Because of its particular drafting history, Article 228 is an obscure provision, as Mr \nAlyoshin explains.166 It provides in part as follows:167  \n“1. A tran saction is to be considered to be contrary to the public policy, provided that  \nit was aimed at (i) violating constitutional human and civil rights and freedoms, or \n(ii) [destroying] or damaging or misappropriating any property of a company or \nindividual or  the state or the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or a local community.  \n2. A transaction that is contrary to the public policy is void. \n3. In the event of failure to satisfy the requirement that a transaction must meet state  \nor public interests or public morals, such transaction may be held invalid …” \n186. It therefore appears that Article 228 applies to two categories of contracts –  \ncontracts that are contrary to public policy as defined in paragraph (1), which are \nvoid as stated in paragraph (2); and contracts  which are not contrary to public policy \nin that sense but nevertheless are inconsistent with public interests/public morals, which may be invalidated by the court.  \n187. There is a disagreement between the experts as to whether the public policy criterion is, in general, interpreted broadly (as Mr Beketov contends) or narrowly \n(as Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida contend). In particular, Mr Alyoshin and Mr \nNahnybida consider that public policy is only breached in exceptional cases “ when \ncontracts strike at the essential foundations of the rule of law ”, whereas Mr Beketov \ndisagrees.\n168  \n \n165  Claim/32A {A1/2/23}  \n166  Alyoshin1/83 {C2/1/29}  \n167  Exhibit 6 to Beketov8: the Ukrainian Civil Code { C1/6/6 } \n168  ULJS/12 {C5/1/8 } \nAA3/1/63\n \n58  188. This is a somewhat arid debate, however, because it makes little sense to treat the \nloans as contrary to public policy and void, regardless of how broad the concept of \npublic policy may  be in general terms.169 A loan is a routine type of commercial \ntransaction and there is nothing in the terms  of the loans in this case  that engages \nconsiderations of public policy. The Bank’s objection to them is that, as it claims, \nthe Borrowers (and/or D1 , a third party) did not intend that drawdowns under the \nloans would be repaid.

Indeed, in other \ncircumstances – perhaps i n most circumstances – it would be in the interests of a \nlender in the position of the Bank to enforce  the loans against the Borrowers when \ndrawdowns were not repaid. It would be surprising, to say the least, if it were unable \nto do so because the fact that the loans had been dishonestly procured meant that \nthey were  contrary to public policy and void.170 \n189. It is no answer to point to the fact that Article 228(1), and the case law applying it, make express reference to the “misappropriation” of private property . The fact that \nmisappropriation of property is contrary to public policy might well mean that an agreement to misappropriate property  would be void. But it does not follow that an \nagreement which one party intends to use as an instrument of a misappropria tion \n(by obtaining property under the contract and failing to return it) should itself be considered to infringe public policy or be void. As already noted, there are good \nreasons why that should not be the case.  \nF6(4)  Related -party lending: Article 52 of the L aw on Banks  \n190. Article 52 of the Law on Banks requires agreements entered into by banks with \nrelated parties to be made on “market ” or “usual ” terms. This gives rise to three \nissues:  \n \n169  For what it is worth, the Supreme Court decision in Chernomornaftogaz , which was published \nafter Mr Beketov prepared his main report, provides clear support for Mr Alyoshi n’s “narrow ” view. \nThe Supreme Court said that “ the category of public policy does not apply to any legal relations in \nthe state, but only those that relate to the essential foundations of the legal order. In view of the \nabove, it can be concluded that public policy consists of public -law relationships that are imperative \nand determine the foundations of the social order of the state ”: {C6/4/33} \n170  Alyoshin1/90 -91 {C2/1/33}  \nAA3/1/64\n \n59  (1) Were the loans made to related parties?  \n(2) Were the terms of the loans excessively favourable to the borrowers?  \n(3) If there was a breach of Article 52, are the loans void or voidable?  \n191. The position is complicated by the fact that Article 52 was substantially amended \non 8 March 20 15: the answers to the above questions may therefore be different in \nrespect of the Relevant Loans and (most of) the Intermediary Loans, on the one hand, and the New Loans (and some of the Intermediary Loans) on the other.  \n192. That said, as to the first  of the above issues, it is  not in dispute that companies in \nwhich D1  had a significant interest were related parties for these purposes.171  \n193. As to the second  issue:  \n(1) Before 8  March  2015, Article 52 applied where an agreement contained \n“more favourable terms than agreements concluded with other persons ” or \n“terms more favourable than usual ” (“preferential terms ”).172 Terms were \nexcessively favourable if they entailed (among other things) the provision of less security than would be required from other clients.   \n(2) From 8  March  2015, Article  52 applied to agreements made “ on terms that \nare not current market terms ” (“non- market terms ”). The list of indicative \nnon-market terms was extended to include, in particular, the charging of \ninterest “ at a lower than ordinary rate ”.\n173  \n(3) It is for the Bank  to prove that the loans were on non- market terms.174 \n194. As to the third  issue:  \n \n171  D1 Defence/61(10)(c) { A1/8/"}

Accordingly, Article \n52 cannot establish that the R elevant Loans or (most of) the Intermediary \nLoans were void.175  \n(2) The relevant wording of the pre - and post -8 March 2015 versions of Article \n52 is not materially different. The former provided that, where Article 52 \napplies, agreements “are declared by the co urt as invalid from the moment of \ntheir conclusion”. 176 The latter similarly provides that agreements “ shall be \ndeclared invalid from the moment of their conclusion”. There is therefore no \nreason to think that the legislator intended any substantive change in this \nrespect. Mr Beketov did not articulate any such reason in his 8th report.177 In \nhis 9th report , Mr Beketov highlights the deletion of the words “ by the \ncourt ”;178 but this is surely immaterial, for how could an agreement be \ndeclared invalid other than by a court?179 Mr Alyoshin considers  that the \nreference to agreements being “declared ” invalid  is a clear indication that \nsuch agreements remain voidable, not void. \nF6(5)  Unauthorised significant transactions: Article 70 of the JSC Law  \n195. Article 70(1) of the JSC Law is a rule of company law which, in the period relevant \nto this case, provided that:  \n“A decision to enter a significant transaction, if the market value of the property or \nservices that are the subject of the transaction is between 10 and 25 percent of the \nvalue of the assets according to the latest annual financial statements of the joint stock company, shall be made by the supervisory board.”\n180 \n \n175  See Annex D to Bank’s 22 May Further Information in response to D1’ s RFI of 21 April 2020 \n{A2/13/1}  for the dates.   \n176  Beketov9/88 {C6/1/34}  \n177  See Beketov8/57 { C1/1/19}  \n178  Beketov9/ 88 {C6/1/34}  \n179  Alyoshin2/200 {C7/1/68 } \n180  Alyoshin1/115 {C2/1/41 } \nAA3/1/66\n \n61  196. Transactions entered i nto in breach of this rule are voidable, if entered into before \n1 May 20 16 (as all the Relevant Loans and Intermediary Loans were).181 There is \n(again) a disagreement as to whether a breach of Article 70(1) after  1 May 20 16  \nrenders a contract void or only voidable.182 However, that does not matter because \nthe Article applies only to transactions which are worth at least 10% of the Bank’s \nassets. None of the loans exceeded that threshold. Thus the rule could only be \nengaged if the loans were considered cumulatively. However, Mr Beketov does not \ncontend that this is possible or appropriate, and Mr Alyoshin confirms that it is \nnot.183  \nF7.

It is common ground that Article 70(5) contains an anti -circumvention \nrule which prevents a company from artificially splitting a transaction into smaller portions to evad e \nthe restriction in Article 70(1): ULJS/18.3 { C5/1/11 }.

It cannot seriously be disputed that the Bank’s conduct in relation to the loans and \nmortgages were consistent with the transactions being valid, and wholly \ninconsistent with its case in these proceedings that they are void. In particular, the \nBank has:  \n(1) Accept ed cash repayments of Relevant and Intermediary Loans;  \n(2) Accepted Transferred Assets by way of repayment of Relevant and \nIntermediary Loans, with no suggestion that the Assets might have to be \nreturned  (which would be the automatic consequence of the Mortga ge \nAgreements being void);186 \n(3) Accepted the need to give the borrowers credit in the amount of the Credit \nValues the Mortgage Agreements, with no suggestion that the credit might be \nreduced;  \n(4) Participated in numerous proceedings in Ukraine on the basis that a ll the \nagreements are valid, as described in detail at Alyoshin3/10 -15,187 and set out \nin Appendix  E hereto . While the Bank was unsuccessful in the proceedings  \nthe courts in each case found that the agreements were valid and binding ;188 \nand  \n(5) Treated all Relevant, Intermediary and New Loans as valid in its Financial \nStatements and only noted an impairment in respect of the New Loans.  \n200. Accordingly, D1 contends that  the venire principle applies such that:   \n(1) The Bank is prohibited from treating Relevant Loans , Inter mediary Loans and \nNew Loans as void;   \n \n186  ULJS/52.2 {C5/1/22}  \n187  Alyoshin3/10 -15 {C9.1/1/6}  \n188  Alyoshin3/15 {C9.1/1/10}  \nAA3/1/68\n \n63  (2) The Bank is therefore prohibited from treating the corresponding Mortgage \nAgreements as void; and   \n(3) Accordingly, the Bank cannot ignore the Credit Values ascribed by the \nMortgage Agreements to Transferred Assets (subject to its other arguments \naddressed below).  \n201.

There is an issue as to whether the venire principle can be invoked to uphold a void \ncontract or whether it only allows a Court to refuse to invalidate a  voidable \ncontract.189  \n(1) Mr Alyoshin contends that the principle applies equally to void and voidable \nloans with the result that a Court may refuse to recognise them as void.190 \n(2) Mr Beketov disagrees, contending that the Court has no discretion to treat as valid contracts which are void as a matter of law.\n191  \n203.

The principles of reasonableness and good faith, of which the venire \ndoctrine is a manifestation, are themselves rules of law established by the Civil \nCode, as is the principle of abuse of rights. There is no good reason why those \nprinciples cannot preclude a party from asserting  that a contract is void, or obtaining \na remedy based on the contract being void, where it has acted in such a way as to disentitle it from doing so, any more than in the equivalent situation where the \n \n189  ULJS/21  {C5/1/12}  \n190  Alyoshin2/221- 229 {C7/1/74 } \n191  Beketov9/109 {C6/1/41}  \n192  Mr Beketov cites a Supreme Court decision from 2018 { C6/4/194} , but he provides only one \nsentence from the judgment which says only that the venire principle can be applied to prevent the \ninvalidity of a voidable transaction: it says nothing about its applicability to a void transaction.  \nAA3/1/69\n \n64  contract is voidable. That the contract may in fact  be void as a matter of law is \nirrelevant.  \nF7(1)(b)   Bad faith?  \n204. In Beketov9, Mr Beketov insists that it is necessary for D1 to show that the Bank \nhas acted in bad faith in alleging that the loans are void, and that the Bank cannot \nbe acting in bad faith if the loans were part of a fraudulent scheme.193 As to that:  \n(1) The suggestion that the venire principle cannot apply  because this is a claim \nin fraud is a non-sequitur , unsupported by any ca se law or reference to the \nCivil Code. Even if the Bank has been the victim of a fraudulent scheme it \nshould still adopt a consistent position and treat the loans as void for all purposes, if it considers that it is entitled to do so, or else accept the \nconsequences of their being valid.  \n(2) If, however, it is necessary to show bad faith, D1 contends that the Bank is acting in bad faith simply by adopting a position as against him which is \ninconsistent with the position adopted as against the borrowers even now and as against him in the past.  That is sufficient to engage the venire principle. As \nMr Alyoshin explains:  \n“[The]  question that a Ukrainian court would consider if a defendant raised the \nissue [of venire]  would be whether a party was acting inconsistently with its \nprevious conduct and, if so, whether in the circumstances it was unfair or \nunconscionable to allow it to do so.”194  \nF7(1)(c)   Detrimental reliance?  \n205. The Bank and Mr Beketov contend that in order to rely on the principle, D1 would \nhave to demonstrate that he relied on the Bank’s previous inconsistent conduct  to \nhis detriment, in treating the loans and Mortgage Agreements as valid.195 However, \nMr Alyoshin does not consider that “ detrimental reliance ” is a necessary  element \n \n193  Beketov9/113(b)  {C6/1/43}  \n194  Alyoshin3/44 {C9.1/1/24}  \n195  Beketov9/113(c) {C6/1/43} ; Beketov11/133- 141 {C9.2/1/51 } \nAA3/1/70\n \n65  to be proved: he refers to several cases in which the Ukrainian Supreme Court \napplied the venire  principle without inquiring into whether there had been \ndetrimental reliance.196 \n206. However, even if it is necessary to demonstrate detrimental reliance, it is present in \nthis case, in that :197 \n(1) The Bank’s counterparties (the Relevant Borrowers, Intermediary Borrowers \nand Transferors) have all relied on the statements of their account s with the \nBank ; and  \n(2) In allowing Transferred Assets to be transferred to the Bank to repay loans \ntreated as  valid under Mortgage Agreements treated as valid, the mortgagors \nrelied on the Bank’s position and specifically its agreement as to the Credit \nValue of the assets.  \n207.

Mr Beketov seeks to draw a distinction for these purposes between reliance by D1 \npersonall y, and reliance by other parties  such as the Borrowers. However:   \n(1) Mr Alyoshin explains that reliance by a third party is a relevant factor when considering the venire principle.\n198  \n(2) More fundamentally, however, it makes little sense to distinguish between D1 and the various corporate entities in this context, when a fundamental \npremise of the Bank’s case is that D1 controlled the corporate entities and \ntook all relevant decisions on their behalf. Such an approach is (again) \ninconsistent and wholly artificial.\n199  \n(3) At the very least D1 relied on the Bank treating loans as valid when he and other owners of the Transferred Assets allowed them to be transferred to the \nBank in return for the Credit Value.  \n \n196  Alyoshin3/42 -69 {C9.1/1/24}  \n197  D1 Defence/88(1)(b) { A1/8/53}  \n198  Alyoshin3/71.1 {C9.1/1/33}  \n199  Alyoshin3/71.2 {C9.1/1/33}  \nAA3/1/71\n \n66  F7(2)  Relevant date for application of the venire principle  \n208. Mr Beketo v suggests that it is not open to D1 to invoke the venire principle in \nrelation to any inconsistent conduct of the Bank which post -dates the issue of the \nclaim in these proceedings.200 This point is of limited significance because the \nmajority of the Bank’s inconsistent conduct took place, or began, before the present \nproceedings were commenced in December 2017. However, D1 will say that it is \nwrong and that Ukrainian law equally prohibits inconsistent conduct that is contrary \nto good faith during the currenc y of the litigation as before the litigation started.  \nF7(3)  Approbation and reprobation in English law  \n209. If necessary, D1 also resists the Bank’s argument that the loans are void/voidable \non the basis of the English law doctrine of approbation and reprobation.201  \n210. This doctrine was thoroughly analysed by Mr Jeremy Cousins QC, sitting as a \ndeputy judge, in Twinsectra Ltd v Lloyds Bank plc  [2018] EWHC 672 (Ch) at \n[73]- [87]. In that case, the claimant companies sought  declarations that certain \ncharges given by them to t he defendant bank as security for a stand- by letter \nof credit facility were invalid.  The Court gave summary judgment for the bank \nbecause, in earlier High Court proceedings, the claimants had sued a former \ndirector for granting the security to the bank in breach of duty. That amounted \nto an irrevocable election to treat the security as valid and the subsequent \nclaim alleging that the security was invalid offended the rule against \napprobation and reprobation.  \n211. A t [87] the Deputy Judge concluded that “ the doct rine of approbation and \nreprobation has now become an established feature of English law ”. The \ncontrolling principle, as he held, was as stated by Sir Nicolas Browne -Wilkinson \nVC in Express Newspapers plc v News (UK) Ltd  [1990] 1 WLR 1320, 1329 \nwhere he said:  \n“There is a principle of law of general application that it is not possible to approbate \nand reprobate.

A man cannot adopt two inconsistent attitudes towards another: he \nmust elect between them and, having elected to adopt one stance, cannot thereafter \nbe permitted to go back and adopt an inconsistent stance.” \n212. At the Pre -Trial Review in March 2023, the Bank opposed the introduction of this \nargument, seeking to argue that (1) the doctrine does not in fact exist, and (2) even \nif it does exist, it is a substantive rule of law which can have no application to a \nclaim governed by Ukrainian law.202  \n213. The first of these points was plainly wrong , and has now been abandoned.203  As to \nwhether  the principle is substantive or procedural  (a point which the Bank does \nmaintain) ,204 this does not appear to have been expressly decided, but the better \nview is that the rule is procedural, or at least has a procedural aspect.  \n(1) It is not a rule governing the “ basis and extent of liability ”, the “grounds for \nexemption from liability ”, or any of the other matters identified in Article 15 \nof the Rome II Regulation  as substantive. \n(2) To the contrary, the essential purpose of the rule is to prevent abuses of the \nCourt’s process, and it may even be a species of abuse of process. See 8 \nRepresentative Claimants v MGN Ltd  [2016] EWHC 855 (Ch) at [34], per \nMann J:  \n“Having relied on the availability of the recovery of CFA additional liabilities \nin this clas s of litigation, the defendant now seeks to rely on the absence of that \nrecovery in the present application. That is a classic approbation and \nreprobation. It is an inconsistency which should not be allowed. An alternative way of looking at it would be to view it as an abuse of process, which in my \nview it is. ”  \n(3) See also  First National Bank plc v Walker  [2001] 1 FLR 505 at [55] per \nMorritt VC: \n“I do not think that the label to be attached, whether estoppel, approbation and \nreprobation, abuse of the process, affirmation or release is of any importance , \nthough on the facts of this case I am inclined to think that all of them apply.”  \n \n202  Bank ’s PTR skeleton/25.3(2) {PTR 2-A/3/25}  \n203  BankOpening/520 { AA2/1/205} \n204  Reply/24B.3(5)(b) {A1/25/31 } \nAA3/1/73\n \n68  214. The Bank also seeks to contend that the approbation principle cannot apply where \na party takes inconsistent positions in proceedings in different jurisdictions between \ndifferent parties.205 The suggestion that the parties to the proceedings must be the \nsame is wrong as the case law referred to above makes clear. As to the suggestion that the doctrine only applies where the earlier proceedings took place in England, \nthis does not appear to be supported by authority, nor is there any reason in principle why that should be the case. \n215. There is no doubt that the conditions for approbation and reprobation are met in this case. As in all the cases cited above, the Bank has consistently affirmed the val idity \nof the loans and security in its own records and in its conduct of the Ukrainian proceedings, and has benefited from doing so in that it has not had to give restitution \nof the assets it obtained pursuant to the Asset Transfers. It is utterly inconsis tent \nwith that, and abusive, for the Bank now to contend that the loans and security are in fact void so as to entitle them to relief, or to an enhanced measure of relief, \nagainst the present Defendants.  \nF8. T\nHE ALTERNATIVE USE OF FUNDS DEFENCE  \n216. In the alternative to the Repayment Defence set out above, D1 relies on the Use of \nFunds Defence.  \n217.

In the alternative to the Repayment Defence set out above, D1 relies on the Use of \nFunds Defence.  \n217. Both experts agree that, in principle, the quantum of loss attributable to the Relevant Loans would not be affected by the fact that monies advanced by the Bank under \nRelev ant Loans were used (or purportedly used) to repay earlier loans.\n206 This is \nthe case as a matter of E nglish law207 and the experts appear to agree that it would \nalso be the case under Ukrainian law.  \n218. However, in advocating that the repayment of a Relevant Drawdown would not necessarily extinguish any loss caused by the advance of funds to the Relevant \nBorrower and that the repayment should be “ ignored”, Mr Beketov is departing \n \n205  Reply/24B.3(5)(c) {A1/25/31 } \n206  Alyoshin2/44 {C7/1/19} ; ULJS/45.2 { C5/1/20 } \n207  See Yurov  [1206]  \nAA3/1/74\n \n69  from the analysis in Yurov  and suggesting that Ukrainian law is  in fact  different \nfrom English law.  \n219. If (but only if) the Bank establishes that – contrary to the Repayment Defence – the \ncash repayments of the Relevant Drawdowns from the proceeds of Intermediary \nLoans and New Loans did not extinguish pro tanto the Bank’s loss  arising from the \nRelevant Drawdowns, such that  Ukrainian law is  in fact  not the same as English \nlaw, it will be necessary to consider the Use of Funds Defence.  \n220. The essence of the Use of Funds Defence is that, if the repayments of Relevant \nDrawdowns do not extinguish pro tanto the Bank’s loss, then the Court must \nconsider the net position of the Bank  as a result of the Relevant Drawdown .208 If \nthe money advanced by the Bank under Relevant Drawdowns was returned to the \nBank to pay off earlier loans which would simply not otherwise have been repaid , \nthen the Bank is no worse off to that extent.209 The effect of repaying such loans is \nto confer a benefit on the Bank which must be taken into account when considering the net effect on the Bank’s position of the Relevant Drawdowns. \n221. D1’s Forensic Accountant has traced the Relevant Drawdowns (and, in particular, the Relevant Drawdown Portions) to the repayment of a number of existing loans \nwhich on the Bank’s own case are worthless and would never have been repaid.  \nThe claim would re duce to around USD 620 million  (for Relevant Drawdowns) or \nUSD 577  million (for Relevant Draw down Portions)  if credit is given for such \npayments: see S ection M7(2)  below. \n222. D1 accepts  that the Use of Funds Defence is only valid to the extent that the loans \nthat were repaid using Relevant Loans would not otherwise have been repaid.  \n223. Mr Beketov speculates that the Bank might have made some recovery in respect of the 193 Borrowers’ loans: \n“…even assuming it can be shown that the earlier loan would never have been repaid \nbut for the theft of funds from B at a later date, B ’s loss resulting from that theft \n \n208  Alyoshin2/46 {C7/1/19} \n209  D1 Defence/56 { A1/8/30}  \nAA3/1/75\n \n70  would not have been reduced by the amount of the repayment. B could still have \nclaims  in respect of that bad debt, including claims  in bankruptcy or liquidation \nproceedings, claims against third parties and/or claims in tort or unjust enrichment \n(depending on all the circumstances of the case). ”210 \n224. However, the Bank tenders no evidence of fact to support Mr Beketov’s \nspeculation. On the contrary , the Bank positively asserts that:  \n(1) The Intermediary Borrowers are no different from the Relevant Borrowers in \nthat they are shell companies with no real business and no means of making \nrepayments.211  \n(2) The 193 B orrowers were “incapable of repaying” th eir loans .212 \nG.

NO UNLAWFUL CONDUCT  \nG1. INTRODUCTION  \n225. As set out in Section E  above, unlawful  conduct by D1 is one of the essential \nelements of a claim under Article 1166 CC.   \n226. While agreeing that the Bank bears the burden of proof on this issue, Mr Beketov \nsuggests that if harm is established then it should be presumed that it was unlawfully \ncaused .213 Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida disagree with this. Their view is that \nunlawfulness needs to be proved by the claimant in every case (although the \nunlawfulness will o ften be obvious, at least in cases not involving pure economic \nloss).214   \n227. It is common in Ukraine for civil law claims based on fraud and dishonesty to be \nmade on the back of a criminal conviction, including within the criminal \n \n210  Beketov1/132 {C1/1/43}  \n211  The Bank refers to the Intermediary Borrowers in its Further Information provided on 22 May 2020, \n[18(a)] {A2/9/17 } and there repeats in relation to them : Claim/18 -19 {A1/2/8 } \n212  Reply/32.4.1 {A1/25/65} \n213  ULJS/24.1, 25.1 { C5/1/13 } \n214  Alyoshin1/194 {C2/1/71 }, Alyoshin2/91- 97 {C7/1/34- 37} \nAA3/1/76\n \n71  proceedings themselves . Criminal conduct is self -eviden tly unlawful, but for a  civil \nclaim based on criminal wrongdoing to succeed, the defendant must first have been \nconvicted.215 Since none of the Defendants have been convicted in Ukraine or \nelsewhere, the Bank’s claim necessarily depends on demonstrating a civil wrong , \nindependent of any criminality . \n228. The Bank has struggled to identify any provisions of Ukrainian civil law that D1 \ncan be said to have breached and which are capable of giving rise to a claim for \ndamages. Ultimately it relies on alleged breaches of  the following :  \n(1) Article 3 CC , which lays down “ general principles of civil legislation ”, \nincluding , in Article 3(1)(2), the principle that no -one should be unlawfully \ndeprived of his property .216 \n(2) Article 13  CC, which provides that rights should not be exercised in a way \nthat violates the rights of others, or with the intention of causing harm or otherwise abusively .  \n(3) Certain provisions of  the Civil Code and banking and company  legislation , \nwhich impose so- calle d “fiduciary duties ” on officers and representatives of \ncompanies, including D1 and D2 in their capacity as members of the Bank’s \nsupervisory board.  \n229. D1’s position in summary is that:  \n(1) The Bank’s reliance on Articles 3 and 13 CC is misplaced . These are general \nprovisions which inform the interpretation and application of civil legislation, \nbut are not actionable in themselves. Moreover :  \n(a) They are not in any case engaged on the facts; and  \n(b) Even if they were actionable in principle, it is not possible to b ring a \ntortious claim where the harm results from a contract such as the \n \n215  Alyoshin1/236- 237 {C2/1/88 } \n216  Alyoshin1, Exhibit AO1 -6 {C2/8/2 } \nAA3/1/77\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n Relevant Loans, as a result of the rule prohibiting competition of \nclaims .217   \n(2) The Bank therefore needs to show that D1 and D2 acted in breach of the \nfiduciary duties they owed to the Bank as supervisory board members. \nHowever, it cannot do so: D1 and D2 did not do (and indeed are not alleged \nto have done) anything which would have amounted to a breach of those \ndutie s. \n230. The requirement of unlawfulness is therefore not made out. This is a  complete \ndefence to the claim.  \nG2. PROVISIONS OF CIVIL L AW RELIED ON BY THE BANK \nG2(1)  Article 3 (1)(2) CC \n231. Article 3(1)(2) CC provides in relevant part as follows: \n“Article 3.

This is a  complete \ndefence to the claim.  \nG2. PROVISIONS OF CIVIL L AW RELIED ON BY THE BANK \nG2(1)  Article 3 (1)(2) CC \n231. Article 3(1)(2) CC provides in relevant part as follows: \n“Article 3. The general principle s of civil legisla tion \nThe fundamental principles of civil legislati on are: \n[…] \n2) the impermissibility of deprivation of the right of own ership except as provid ed \nby the Constitution of Ukraine and by law […]”  \n232. The Bank contends that Article 3 (1)(2) prohibits a person from depriving others of \ntheir property rights except in circumstances provided by the Constitution or other \nlaws of Ukraine. It  alleges that D1’s conduct was unlawful insofar as it is shown to \nhave resulted in the Bank being deprived of its money when it disbursed Relevant \nDrawdowns .218\n233. For D1, Mr Alyoshin says that Article 3 is only a ge neral principle, not a\nsubstantive\n(actionable) rule, a nd is also generally inapplicable in disputes between private\nparties: Alyoshin1/198-200 {C2/1/73}.\n217 Alyoshin1/179 { C2/1/65 } \nClaim /51(a)  {A1/2/29}  218 \n72 \n AA3/1/78\n \n73  234. In support of its proposition that causing harm t o its property rights, or doing so \nwith an intention to cause harm, to its property rights amounts to “ unlawful \nconduct ” for the purposes of Article 1166, the Bank relies on Mr Beketov’s \nopinions . \n235. Mr Beketov considers that any behaviour which causes harm can be considered \nunlawful.219 \n236. He also says that : \n“I consider it self -evident that a person who misappropriates someone else ’s property \nhas: \nacted contrary to inter alia the general principles enshrined at Articles 3(1)(2) and \n3(1)(6) of the Civil Code, Artic le 3 of the ECHR [sic] (see paragraph 147(c) above) \nand Article 41 of the Constitution (Ukraine ’s highest law); and  \nunlawfully  caused harm, such that unless they can show that they acted without fault, \nthey will have committed an actionable tort. ”220 \n237. Mr Beke tov in fact goes even further and argues that the unlawfulness of a \ndefendant’s conduct will be presumed if that conduct is shown to have caused harm \nand it is then for the defendant to establish the absence of fault: Beketov8/ 93 \n{C1/1/31}. \n238. D1 will say that Mr Beketov is wrong. There is no presumption of unlawfulness ;221 \nand in Mr Alyoshin’s view  Article 3 of the Civil Code establishes only general \nprinciples, not specific , actionable  duties. Conduct which is inconsistent only with \na general principle , and does not contravene any specific rule , is not unlawful \nconduct sufficient for a claim under Article 1166. The Bank must demonstrate a \nbreach of a duty owed by D1 to the Bank under a specific statutory provision in \norder to establish the necess ary unlawful conduct.222 \n \n219  ULJS /25.1 {C5/1/13}  \n220  Beketov9/166 {C6/1/6 4} \n221  ULJS /25.2 {C5/1/14}  \n222  Alyoshin2/54 -59 {C7/1/22}  \nAA3/1/79\n \n74  239. While the Ukrainian Supreme Court has said that general principles of law are \npotentially capable of being applied directly, where there are no relevant specific \nrules ,223 there is no previous case in which damages have been awarded under \nArticle 1166 solely on the basis of a violation of a general principle such as Article \n3(1)(2): Alyoshin2/64 { C7/1/25}. \n240. Mr Alyoshin also considers  that, whether Article 3 (1)(2) is theoretically actionable \nor not, it cannot have been breached on the facts of this case. That is because the \nBank has not been deprived of its property unlawfully, i.e. in a manner not \n“provided by law ”. To the contrary, the Bank transferred funds to the Borrowers \npursuant to contracts, i.e. the Relevant Loans . It therefore  intended to part with its \nmoney and acquired contractual rights against the Borrowers when it did so.

The Bank alleges that D1’s conduct was unlawful insofar as he violated the Bank’s rights and intended to cause it harm.\n225 \n243. As with Article 3(1)(2), there does not appear to be any Ukrainian case where damages have been awarded in tort on the basis of a breach of Article 13(2)  or \n \n223  See in particular the Yuststar  case {C1/145} , referred to at Beketov8/77 {C1/1/24} \n224  Alyoshin1, Exhibit AO1 -6 {C2/8/2 } \n225  Claim /51(b)  {A1/2/29 } \nAA3/1/80\n \n75  13(3).

Mr Alyoshin explains that , in Ukraine, Article 13 is normally invoked defensively, \nas a shield against a claimant’s attempt to enforce its rights in a way which is \nmalicious, disproportionat e or otherwise inappropriate .226 In his view  (albeit this is \ndisputed by Mr Beketov) the abuse of a right in this sense is prohibited and such \nactions may be denied legal effect, but they do not give rise to a right to \ncompensation.227   \n245. Aside from the issue a s to whether Articles 13 (2) and 13(3) are actionable in \nprinciple, it is also unclear what “ right ” the Bank contends that D1 abused. The \nBank’s pleadings are silent on this point and Mr Beketov’s reports shed no light on it either.  \n246. As Mr Alyoshin explains, D1 did not (whether through his indirect shareholding or otherwise) have any legal right to issue directions to or control the Bank, its \nemployees, or the Borrowers.\n228 In his view, i f D1 was not exercising any legal \nright when he al legedly procured the Relevant Loans then he cannot be guilty of \nacting unlawfully by abusing any such right.229 \nG2(3)  Competition of Claims: No harm absent a breach of fiduciary duty  \n247. Even if it is possible in principle for the Bank to satisfy the requirement of unlawfulness by relying on a breach of Article 3(1)(2) and/or Article 13(2) -(3) (both \nas a matter of law and on the facts), it faces a further difficulty in the form of the \nrule known as the prohibition on competition of claims.\n230  \n \n226  Alyoshin1/205- 206 {C2/1/75 } \n227  Alyoshin1/207 {C2/1/77 } \n228  Alyoshin1/210 {C2/1/78 } \n229  Alyoshin1/209 {C2/1/78 } \n230  The issue is identified at ULJS/47.2 { C5/1/21}  and discussed in detail at Alyoshin1/173- 179 \n{C2/1/63}  and Beketov9/201- 209 {C6/1/86}  \nAA3/1/81\n \n76  248. It is common ground that, where a claimant has a contract  with the defendant (at \nleast where the contract is valid) it  must bring any claims in contract and cannot \nelect to bring a claim in tort instead. Mr Alyoshin’s evidence , which is supported \nby an analysis of several cases, is that the Ukrainian courts have extended that \nreasoning to “ three -party ” situations so that tort claims cannot be brought even \nagainst third parties where the grounds for the claim arise from a contract .231 Since \nany loss arises out of the non- performance of the contract, the claimant’s  only \nremedy is to enforce the contract"}

Mr Beketov disagrees and contends that a claimant has a choice as to which cause \nof action to pursue in this situation (although he does not directly address the case \nlaw cited by Mr Alyoshin) .232  \n250. It is common ground, however, that a claim in tort will not be barred by the rule \nagainst competition of claims if the defendant is an officer or employee of a \ncompany and the claim is based on a breach of the defendant’s duties to the \ncompany under the Civil Code or other specific legislation.233 The competition of \nclaims point therefore only arises if the Bank fails to establish that there has been \nsuch a breach of duty by D1. \nG2(4)  Breach of fiduciary duty  \n251. The Bank claims that D 1 breached his duties under the following statutory \nprovisions , with its expert Mr Beketov going so far as to say that the breaches are \n“self-evident ”:234  \n(1) Article 92(3) of the Civil Code. This applies to anyone acting on behalf of a \nlegal entity of any kind, and provides that  \n“A body or person who according to the constitutional documents of the legal \nentity  or the law acts in the name of the legal entity is obligated to act in the \n \n231  Alyoshin1/175- 178 { C2/1/64 } \n232  Beketov9/201- 209 {C6/1/86 } \n233  Alyoshin1/180 {C2/1/66 } \n234  Beketov9/291 {C6/1/120}  \nAA3/1/82\n \n77  interests of the legal entity in good faith and reasonably and not exceed its \nauthority  ”.235 \n(2) Article 63(1) of the JSC Law. This applies to all officers of joint stock \ncompanies and requires them to “ act in the interests of the company, follow \nthe requirements of the law, provisions of the charter and other documents of the company ”.\n236 \n(3) Article 43 of the Law on Banks. This requires executives of a bank “ to act for \nthe benefit of the bank and its clients and place the bank’s interests above \ntheir own when performing their obligations ”.237 \n(4) From 10 January 2015, Article 42 of the Law on B anks. This  is in similar \nterms to Article 63 JSC Law and  provides  in relevant part  that: \n“executives of a bank are obligated to act in the bank ’s interests and to observe \nthe requirements of the law, the provisions of [the bank ’s] charter and other \ndocuments of the bank ”.238 \n252. It is not necessary for present purposes to differentiate between these duties: they \nare all substantively similar and there is no dispute that at least the last three of them \n(Article 63(1) JSC Law and Articles 42 -43 Law on Banks)  applied to D1 in his \ncapacity as a member of the Bank's supervisory board. There is a disagreement \nbetween the experts as to the scope of Article 92(3) CC ,239 but, in the circumstances, \nthe Court need not attempt to resolve this. \n253. The central question in relation to the above duties is whether they only apply to a n \nexecutive when he is exercising  (or should be exercising)  his functions qua  \nexecutive, or whether they apply at all times .   \n254. D1’s position is that, as a S upervisory Board mem ber, his only function and \nresponsibility in relation to the issuing of loans by the Bank was to consider loans \n \n235  Beketov8, Exhibit: Ukrainian Civil Code { C1/6/3 } \n236  Beketov8 , Exhibit: JSC Law { C1/22/7}  \n237  Beketov8 , Exhibit : Law on Banks (version as of 13 February 2020 ) {C1/24/2 } \n238  Beketov8 , Exhibit 6: Law on Banks (version as of 6 February 2015)  {C1/23/5}  \n239  See ULJS/67 { C5/1/27}  \nAA3/1/83\n \n78  which, by virtue of their size, were required to be approv"}

Since (as is common ground) the Relevant Loans were not referred to the \nSupervisory B oard for approval, D1 did not participate in any relevant decision of \nthe Board. He therefore cannot have committed a breach of his duties as a member \nof the B oard.240 \n255. However, the Bank contends that these duties are owed at all times so that any  act \nor omission by D1 vis -à-vis the Bank which is in bad faith or contrary to the Bank’s \ninterests , such as his inferred tacit approval of the Relevant L oans or his failure to \nprevent them being granted , amounts to unlawful conduct in the  form of a breach \nof fiduciary duty.241 \n256. As noted above, Mr Beketov says that it is “ self-evident ” that a bank executive who : \n“…orchestrates or otherwise participates in a scheme to embezzle funds from their \nbank … will necessarily have breached their fiduciary duties to the bank (including \nthose owed under Article 43 [ of the Law on Banks ].”242 \n257. However , this supposedly obvious proposition is not supported by authority and Mr \nAlyoshin disagrees with it:  \n(1) In his opinion, whether or not a company executive is in breach of his \nfiduciary duty will depend on his position within the  company  and the acts \ncommitted by him.243  \n(2) An act or omission that is contrary to the Bank’s interests will only amount \nto a breach of duty if it occurs in relation to the ex ecutive’s performance of \nhis duties as an officer of the bank.  \n(3) Such an act or omission will not be a breach of duty merely because it is \ncommitted by someone who happens to be an executive of the company, if it \nis not connected with that person’s executive functions.  \n \n240  D1 Defence/61(8)(c) { A1/8/38 } \n241  Reply/14.3A {A1/25/22}  \n242  Beketov9/291 {C6/1/120}  \n243  ULJS /74.2 {C5/1/30} \nAA3/1/84\n \n79  258. The contrary position, whereby fiduciary duties apply “ at all times ”: \n(1) Is inconsistent with the wording of Article 43, which expressly applies to \nexecutives “when performing their obligations ”; and  \n(2) Makes no sense, inasmuch as it would prevent an executive from ever doing anything contrary to the interests of the Bank, even where he had legitimate \ngrounds for doing so (for example, in the event of a dispute over his \nremuneration, or the operation of his account in the case of a bank executive , \nor as a shareholder ).\n244 That cannot be the law. \n259. Accordingly, the Bank needs to identify a wrongful act or omission committed by \nD1 in the course of performing his role as a supervisory board member : the mere \nfact that D1 was a supervisory board member at the  time when he committed a \nwrongful act does not suffice for a claim based on a breach of fiduciary duty. However, the Bank has barely attempted to do this. The fact is that the supervisory \nboard’s role is a limited one: it consists, so far as relevant, of considering and \napproving proposed loans above a certain value. But there is no evidence that the \nRelevant Loans were ever considered by the supervisory board; and if they were \nnot considered by the supervisory board then D1 cannot have approved them in hi s \ncapacity as a supervisory board member .  \n260. Mr Beketov argues that the value of the Relevant Loans was such that they ought \nto have been referred to the Supervisory Board for approval and says that, since \nthey were not, the Supervisory Board are liable unle ss they prove that they were not \nat fault : Beketov8/214 {C1/1/71}. However:  \n(1) It"}

However:  \n(1) It is unclear why the Supervisory Board would have acted unlawfully in that \nsituation. It may be that Mr Beketov is assuming that the approval of the \nRelevant Loans was unlawfully  delegated to the Bank’s Credit Committee; \nbut no allegation of unlawful delegation of responsibility is pleaded by the \nBank. \n \n244  Alyoshin2/107 {C7/1/40 } \nAA3/1/85\n \n80  (2) There is no witness giving evidence of unlawful delegation or any basis upon \nwhich is should be assumed that the Supervisory Board knew that the Credit \nCommittee was approving the loans for which its approval was needed.  \n261. Mr Beketov criticises Mr Alyoshin’s “ compartmentalised” approach,245 but Mr \nAlyoshin is applying Ukrainian law as it is applied in Ukraine and as it should be applied in this Court. Far from there being anything strange about Mr Alyoshin’s \nanalysis, it is Mr Beketov who appears to be advocating a peculiarly anglicised \napproach to claims against controlling shareholders  or de facto directors . This will \nno doubt be explor ed further in cross -examination.  \nG2(5)  Article 1190 CC   \n262. The Bank relies  in part  on Article 1190 CC , which  provides that where two or more \npersons jointly cause harm to the claimant, their liability is joint and several.\n246 \n263. It is agreed between the experts that Article 1190 does not provide a basis for \ntortious liability,247 does not make conduct unlawful if it would not otherwise be \nunlawful ,248 and is not analogous to the tort of conspiracy in English law.249   \n264. All that Article 1190 does is confirm that, where multip le defendants are each liable \nto the claimant in respect of the same harm, their liability is prima facie joint and \nseveral. That is subject to Article 1190(2) which permits the court to apportion \nliability between the responsible parties “ in proportion to their respective degrees \nof fault ”. \n265. Despite that agreement, Mr Beketov maintains that Article 1190 enables a court to \nimpose a liability in tort on a defendant for procuring an unlawful act by another \nperson. How that can be reconciled with his agreement that Article 1190 does not \nmake conduct tortious  which is not otherwise  tortious in itself is not currently \n \n245  Beketov9/292 {C6/1/120}  \n246  Beketov8, Exhibit: Ukrainian Civil Code { C2/8/12}  \n247  ULJS/56.1 {C5/1/24}  \n248  ULJS/56.2 {C5/1/24}  \n249  ULJS/57.1 {C5/1/24}  \nAA3/1/86\n \n81  explained . For his part Mr Alyoshin disagrees with Mr Beketov, for the reason just \nmentioned and also on the basis that: \n(1) First, procuring  or causing  unlawful acts by others is not specifically \nprohibited by the Ukrainian Civil Code, nor is it a concept known to \nUkrainian civil law or court practice at all.  This is therefore an issue on which \nUkrainian law clearly differs from English law, which does of course recognise various forms of accessory liability in civil claims.   \n(2) Secondly , there is no direct causal link between any acts of procurement and \nthe harm. Any harm will have been directly caused by the third party who \nwas ex hypothesi induced by D1 to carry out the relevant unlawful act. This \nis addressed further in Section H  below in the context of causation.  \nH. NO CAUSATION  \n266. If, contrary to D1’s case, the Bank is able to prove both that it has suffered harm as \na result of the Relevant L oans, and that D1 acted unlawfully in relation to the \nRelevant Loans, D1 will contend that the claim fails in a ny event as a matter of \ncausation.  \n267.

The Civil Code does not contain a definition of causation, but the test has been discussed in case law.\n250 There is a disagreement between the experts  as to the effect \nof that case law :251  \n(1) Mr Beketov says that causation is simply a question of fact, the “ general \nquestion” being whether the unlawful conduct is a “ but for ” cause of the harm.  \n(2) Mr Alyoshin agree s that causation is ultimately a question of fact, and that  \n“but for ” causation is necessary  for causation to be established, but does not \nagree that it is sufficient. In his view  (which is shared by Mr Nahnybida) the \ntest is much stricter in that “ the court practice clearly shows that the causal \n \n250  ULJS/40.1 {C5/1/18}  \n251  ULJS/41 {C5/1/19}                                                                                  \nAA3/1/87\n \n82  link must also be direct, necessary and inevitable ”. Mr Alyoshin refers to a \nnumber of Supreme Court decisions where the test has been stated in terms \nsuch as “direct ” and “immediate ”, as well as to cases where claims against \nbank officials have failed for lack of causation.252 \n268. As Mr Beketov a cknowledges, however, t his disagreement is not ultimately of great \nsignificance.253 In particular:  \n(1) The Bank ’s case is, as set out above, based solely and specifically on the harm \nwhich it allegedly suffered  when the Relevant Drawdowns took place, and \nwhich it says was not remedied when the Relevant Loans were in due course \nrepaid.254  \n(a) It does not rely on any harm that may have been suffered at a later point \nin time , for example,  when subsequent loans were issued and/or not \nrepaid.  \n(b) It is therefore not necessary to consider whether such a claim would \nsatisfy the test of causation under Ukrainian law, although Mr Alyoshin \nis clear that it would not: indeed, as he speculates, that may well be the reason why the Bank has not formulated its claim in that way.\n255  \n(2) It appears to be common ground that  the standard test of causation  is not \nsatisfied by an act which consists of procuring unlawful conduct by another \nperson.256 Plainly in that situation  the procurer’s act is not the “ direct ”, \n“immediate ” or “inevitable ” cause of the harm, since the harm would not be \nsuffered without the voluntary intervening acts of other parties. In the case of \n \n252  Alyoshin1/250- 255 {C2/1/92 } \n253   See Beketov9/189 { C6/1/78} : “I do not think there is much between us. ” Mr Beketov accepts in the \nsame paragraph that the Supreme Court has held that the causal link must be “direct ”, although he \nsuggests that “direct ” causation is not in fact necessary if the defendant ’s conduct is the “ main \nreason” for the harm: Beketov9/191 { C6/1/80} \n254  Further Information dated 21 April 2020/6 { A2/9/9 }: “The Bank suffered a loss as a result of the \nBorrowers failing validly to repay all or part of the Relevant Drawdowns ”. \n255  Alyoshin1/258 {C2/1/95 } \n256  See Beketov8/191 { C1/1/63}:  “it might be that no causative connection (in the ‘ but for ’ sense) would \nbe found to exist between the harm suffered by the victim and that particular defendant ’s actions ”. \nAA3/1/88\n \n83  the Relevant Loans, the other parties necessarily involved in the causal chain \nwould include employees of the Bank as well as the Borrowers  and the \nSuppliers.  \n269.

To overcome this latter point,  however, Mr Beketov seeks to develop a theory of \ncausation whereby  the causation test is modified in cases of joint ly caused harm \nfalling within Article 1190 CC . In such cases, he suggests, the relevant question is \nwhether “the joint tortfeasors’ acts when taken together caused harm ”,257 not \nwhether each individual defendant’s actions did so.   \n270. This is not correct , and appears to be another example of special pleading by Mr \nBeketov . Apart from its novelty,258 it is objectionable on a conceptual level because \nit avowedly involves using Article 1190 CC to extend the reach of Article 1166 CC \nto make a defendant liable who would not be liable under the terms of Article 1166 \nitself . As explained above, this is not the function of Article 1190 CC, which \nregulates the extent  of the liability of multiple wrongdoers , each of whom is liable \nto the claimant under Article 1166. The elements of liability under Article 1166, \nincluding causation, must be established in respect of each defendant , before Article \n1190 comes into play. \nI. LI MITATION  \n271. D1 contends that the whole of the claim is out of time under Ukra inian law . \nI1. UKRAINIAN LAW OF L IMITATION  \n272. The following points are agreed: \n(1) The applicable limitation period in Ukrainian law  is three years , under Article \n257 CC.  \n \n257  ULJS/41.2 {C5/1/19}  \n258  Mr Beketov does seek to support his theory with references to case law (Beketov8/192- 194 \n{C1/1/63} ; Beketov9/234- 239 {C6/1/94 }. Commenting on Beketov8, Mr Alyoshin says that this \nreliance is misplaced because the cases in question were concerned with concurrent causes of harm, \nnot with a sequence of events ultimately leading to harm: Aly oshin2/266- 268 {C7/1/89} \nAA3/1/89\n \n84  (2) The limitation period starts to run on the date when the claimant either \nbecame aware, or could have become aware, of the vi olation of its right “ or” \nthe person who violated such right .259 There is a dispute as to whether “or ” \nshould in fact be read as “ and”260 which is unlikely to be significant.  \n(3) In determining when the claimant “ could have ” become aware of the relevant \nfacts, parties are presumed to exercise reasonable prudence and to take a \nreasonable level of interest in the state of their affairs .261 \n(4) The claim form was issued on 21 December 20 17. Accordingly, so far as the \nmajority of the Bank’s claim is concerned, the question for the Court is \nwhether the Bank knew or could have become aware of the alleged violation \nof its rights before 21 December 20 14. (There is a dispute as to the applicable \nlimitation period for the claims which were added by amendment in 2020: this is add ressed below.)  \n(5) The Court has a discretion under Article 267(5) CC to disapply a limitation period if there are objective reasons beyond the c laimant’s control that \nprevented or significantly hindered the c laimant from bringing an action in \ndue time.\n262 \nI2.

If that is right,  then those facts \nwould have been known to members of the M anagement Board and to the \nCredit Committee at the time when the Relevant Drawdowns took place.  \n274. Mr Beketov anticipated this defence in his first expert report\n267 but contended that \nthere would be compelling arguments (in the alternative) that: \n(1) There were valid reasons why the claim was not brought within the limitation \nperiod because the wrongdoing was disguised.  \n(2) The limitation period did not start before the nationalisation of the Bank in December 2016 because before that time the Bank itself could not be said to \nhave acquired actual or constructive knowledge since any agent whose knowledge might otherwise have been attributed to the Bank was acting to defraud the Bank.  \n(3) The Defendants should not be entitled to raise the limitation defence because in doing so they were abusing their rights.  \n \n264  There is a dispute between the experts as to attribution more generally: ULJS/109 { C5/1/42 } \n265  D1 Defence/7(2) { A1/8/4 } \n266  D1 Defence/86(1) { A1/8/50}  \n267  Beketov1/143 {D/27/42}  \nAA3/1/91\n \n86  I2(2) Constructive Knowledge \n275. The Bank contends that the  transactions comprising the  alleged Misappropriation \nof its funds by the Relevant Drawdowns w ere “disguised” from it . This is not the \ncase.  \n276. Even if the Bank did not know of the abuse of its rights before then, it either knew \nor “could have  become aware of ” both the violation of its rights  and (if necessary) \nthe person who may have benefitted from the violation before  the end of November \n2014. \n277. D1 relies in this regard on the following matters: \n(1) The Bank knew that the Defendant Suppliers had not delivered goods or \nreturned prepayments for goods due under the Relevant Supply Agreements \nto the Relevant Borrowers by November 2014. As Mr Lewis explained in his \nfirst Affidavit for the Bank in support of the WFO:268 \n(a) Between September and November 2014,  51 identical claims were \nbrought by all but three Relevant Borrowers against a Defendant \nSupplier and the Bank (against whom relief was sought in the form of \nthe invalidation  of the pledges) seeking an order that prepayments for \ngoods be returned (the “ 2014 Ukrainian Claims ”); \n(b) Judgments were handed down between 15 October 2013 to 24 \nNovember 2014 ordering the funds (comprising Unreturned \nPrepayments) to be returned by the Defendant Suppliers to the Relevant \nBorrower.  \n(2) On 4 November 2014, the Bank was approached by a Ukrainian media \nwebsite named “Glavcom” with a request to comment on allegations to be \nmade in a forthcoming article regarding the Bank’s lending to 30 Relevant \nBorrowers and their claims against the Defendant Suppliers, i.e. , the 2014 \n \n268  Lewis, 1st Aff/275 -278 {H1/1/61- 62} \nAA3/1/92\n \n87  Ukrainian Claims.269 The request and the appropriate response were \ndiscussed by Dubilet and other officers of the Bank.270  \n(3) On 7  November 2014, an article was published on “Glavcom” written by Mr \nFedor Oryshchuk entitled “ Did Kolomoisky withdraw"}

Officials at the \nBank were approached by the GPO investigators.

Furthermore : \n(1) It is agreed that prima facie , the knowledge of members  of the Management \nCommittee is attributed to the Bank.279 The Management Board is responsible \nfor the day -to-day running of the Bank and its members must have been aware \nof the facts relied upon by the Bank in these proceedings. The Bank’s only \nargument to rebut its own knowledge of these facts is that members of the \nManagement Board  were party to the fraud such that their knowledge should \nnot be attributed. D1’s response is that the Bank has failed to show that all  (or \nany) members of the Management Board were party to the alleged  fraud. \n(2) While the B ank has simply asserted that Mr Dubilet and Ms Gurieva were \naccomplices of D1 and/or D2, there is no direct evidence that they were party \nto a fraud and the circumstantial evidence relied on is inadequate for it t o be \nconcluded that the only inference to be drawn is that they were party to a fraud.  Moreover, the Bank has not attempted to make any claim against the \npeople it now accuses of being accomplices, whether  in these proceedings or \nelsewhere, or explained wh y it chose not to do so. The Court should be \nreluctant in those circumstances to find they were party to a fraud.  \n(3) The Bank’s sweeping statement that it is implausible that members of the Management Board could have possessed the knowledge of the relevant facts \nsufficient to start time running without having been party to the fraud must be rejected.\n280 There were many more members of the Bank’s Electronic \nCredit Committee (“ ECC”) and Management Board  who knew (or could \nequally well have found out) about the alleged infringement of the Bank’s \nrights  having become aware of the Glavcom article: see Appendix F.

In his first affidavit, having \nacknowledged that the Bank was party to the 2014 Ukrainian Claims, Mr \nLewis suggested that he would be making enquiries of “ those concerned ” \nincluding “ the Bank’s then Ukrainian lawyers ”.\n290 Having done so, the Bank \nhas chosen not to tender evidence from any of them. \n281. Accordingly, there is no evidence upon which it can be found that actual or \nconstructive knowledge of the relevant facts should not be attributed to the Bank \nprior to nationalisation on the basis that all relevant perso nnel were involved in the \nfraud.

The Bank contends that D1 cannot rely on a limitation defence to avoid \ncompensating the Bank because that would be abusive under Article 16(3) CC.291 \nMr Alyoshin rejects that contention. It would be bizarre if taking a def ence afforded \nby law were an abuse of the right to do so, especially in  circumstances where the \nlimitation period does not start to run until the claimant knows  or should have \nknown the relevant facts to be able to bring a claim . Mr Alyoshin rightly considers \nthat the Bank needs to secure the exercise of the specific discretion under Article \n267(5) CC , and cannot otherwise circumvent the limitation relying on the broader \nprinciple of abuse of rights .292 \nI2(5) Exercise of Discretion Under Article 267(5)  \n283. There is a h igh threshold to be passed before a Court will exercise its discretion \nunder Article 267(5) of the Civil Code.293 D1 will submit this has not been met.  \n284. Once a legal entity has the necessary knowledge to start time running, the limitation \nperiod is not interr upted if there is a change of management and the newly \nappointed management of the legal entity becomes aware of the potential claim only after its appointment.\n294 \n285. . There is no good reason for extending the limitation period given what happened \nafter the al legations in the Glavcom Article were published .  \n286.

LIMITATION AS APPLIED TO THE CLAIMS ADDED BY AMENDMENT IN JULY \n2020 \n292. In July 2020, the Bank amended the Particulars of Claim so as to include claims to \nhave suffered loss as a result of the making of Relevant Loans to Prominmet (a \nUkrainian Borrower) and the three Cypriot Borrowers.  \n293. Objection was made to the amendments on the grounds that they added new and separate causes of action and, as a result,  they were permitted strictly on terms that \nD1’s right to contend that they were out of time  would be preserved.\n311 \n294. Amendments are generally treated as if they were made when the claim was issued. \nHowever,  CPR 17.4(2) provides: \n“The court may allow an amendment whose effect will be to add … a new claim, but \nonly if the new claim arises out of  the same facts or substantially the same facts as \nare already in issue on a claim in respect  of which the party applying for permission \nhas already claimed a remedy in the proceedings. ” \n295. In his expert reports produced for the trial, Mr Beketov accepts that  the Bank was \nthe victim of a series of torts and that procuring each loan is a separate tort. D1 contends that it is clear that the amendments introduced new causes of action . \n296. D1 further contends that these causes of action did not arise out of the same o r \nsubstantially the same facts as were  already in issue and relies on the rule that  \n“[b]roadly similar allegations, implicitly made or understood, will not do” \nSAMBA v Byers  [2019] 4 WLR 54 (CA): see [39-40]; [50- 55]. \n297. The allegations concerning Prominmet and the Cypriot Borrowers are significantly different from those concerning the other 46 Ukrainian Borrowers. Self -evidently \nthey involve different agreements, different (alleged) unlawful acts and different losses. If that were not enough (which it plainly is), the nature and circumstances \nof these agreements are significantly different from the agreements that were originally pleaded.

The Bank has never attempted to explain why these claims were not brought in \nDecember 2017. It is to be inferred that there is no good reason why they were not.  \n299. Instead, using carefully chosen words, t he Bank claims that it first acquired \nknowledge of the alleged misappropriation “ in the manner alleged in these \nproceedings ” between August and December 2017 in order to argue that the \nlimitation period did not start at all before then .313  \n300. The fact that Hogan Lovells were formally engaged on 7  August 2017314 does not \nmean that the Bank did not know of the claims before then. It plainly did, as \nexplained in Secti on I2 above. \n301. Even if the Court were to delay the commencement of the limitation period until \nnationalis ation in December 2016, the NBU was already investigating potential \nclaims against D1 and D2. What happened between then and August 2017 is inadequately explained  by the Bank’s witness statements . \n302. There is no basis upon which the commencement of the limitation period should be \ndelayed for eight  months after December 2016 so that it did not start (for any of its \nclaims) until August 2017 or later.  Accordingly, the claims added by way of \namendment in July 2020 are undoubtedly statute barred.  \nJ. CURRENCY OF ANY LOSS  \nJ1. OVERVIEW  \n303. It is common ground that the issue to be determined as a matter of English law is a question of fact: in which currency did the Ba nk feel its loss?  \n \n312  Thompson1/3.166 {D1/1/94} \n313  Reply/23.1A { A1/25/28 } \n314  Hardman1/17 {H1/14/5} \nAA3/1/103\n \n98  304. On this issue the parties adopt diametrically opposite views: \n(1) The Bank contends that USD Relevant Drawdowns caused it a loss in USD \nto the extent they were not repaid,315 but also that UAH Drawdowns caused \nit a loss in USD.316  \n(2) D1 contends that the Bank’s loss was felt entirely in its functional currency \nUAH, whether Relevant Drawdowns were made in USD or UAH.317 \nJ2. THE LAW \n305. Under English law (which is what matters, as the lex fori ) it is settled law that \ndamages should be calculated in the currency  “in which the loss was felt by the \nclaimant ” or “which most truly expresses his loss ” as a matter of fact , taking into \naccount “the way in which it conducted its business ”: The Despina R  (HL) [1979] \nAC 685, at 697- F – 698-D. \n306. T he movement of currency exchange rates since the time of the loss and the time \nof judgment is irrelevant to the question of determining which currency is the currency in which the loss was felt: The Despina R  at 698D; The Texaco \nMelbourne [1994] 1 Lloyd’s Reports 473, at 476, col.2. \nJ3. THE BANK’S PLEADED  POSITION  (USD  ONLY) \nJ3(1)  The Claim Form \n307. It appears that the original basis for the Bank claiming entirely in USD is likely to \nbe explained by the fact that it calculate s its loss by reference to the amount of \nUnre turned Prepayments which were all made by the Relevant Borrowers to the \nDefendant Suppliers in USD.318 \n \n315  Reply/47.8 {A1/25/76} \n316  Reply/47/8 {A1/25/76} \n317  D1 Defence/83H { A1/8/49} \n318  Reply/47.3 { A1/25/77}  \nAA3/1/104\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The amount claimed in the Claim Form319 is purely and simply the amount of \nthe Unreturned Prepayments, i .e.

Any loss to the Bank was caused when the Bank made Relevant Drawdowns to the \nRelevant Borrowers. While the Bank claims that portions of these advances funded \nthe Unreturned Prepayments322 and were misappropriated ,323 those Relevant \nDrawdowns were made in a mixture of UAH and USD.  \nJ3(2)  The Reply  \n311. In its Reply, the Bank does not  rely directly upon the currency of the Unreturned \nPrepayments in seeking to maintain its position that it suffered a loss in USD.  \n312. Instead: \n(1) In the case of USD Relevant Drawdowns, it relies purely on the fact that it \nadvanced funds in USD to Relevant Borrowers which were not returned.324  \n319 \n320 \n321 \n322 \n323 \n324 \n99 Claim For m {A1/1/1}\nFAJS1/5.1 { D4/1/7}; and T hompson1/7.1 { D1/1/278}, and 7.9 {D1/1/79}\nPractice Direction 16, para. 9.1 provides that: “Where a claim is for a sum of money expressed in a\nforeign cur rency it must state – (1) that the claim is for payment in a specified foreign currency, (2)\nwhy it is for payment in that cur rency, (3) the Sterling equivalent of the sum at the date of the\nclaim, and (4) the source of the exchange rate r elied on to calculate the Sterling equivalent.”\nClaim/16 {A 1/2/7}\nClaim/52( 1) {A1/2/29}\nReply/47.1 { A1/25/77}\nAA3/1/105\n \n100  (2) It maintains that although the Bank reported  its assets and liabilities in UAH \n(its presentational currency), it accounted  for them in USD (and converted \nthe amount of them into UAH at the end of each financial year at the current \nexchange rate in order to report their current value in UAH).325 \n(3) In the case of UAH Relevant Drawdowns, it relies on two matters: \n(a) The Bank refers to a provision of the Relevant Loans which provided \nfor the borrower to pay a fee to the Bank the calculation of which was \nrelated to changes in the UAH/USD exchange rate. 326  \n(b) The Bank also seeks to maintain its attempt to claim that it suffered a loss in USD even when making Relevant Drawdowns in UAH by \npointing out that within a short period of time of borr owing in UAH, \nthe Relevant Borrower bought USD from the Bank.\n327 \n313. As for the Bank’s claim that it accounted for USD loans in USD rather than UAH: \n(1) Mr Davidson notes, by reference to the Bank’s audited financial statements, \nthat the aggregate amount of the Bank ’s assets and liabilities does not appear \nto be much affected from year  to year by the deterioration in the value of \nUAH against USD, which he  considers is a basis upon which to draw the \ninference that the risk to the B ank attaching to these assets and liabilities is \ncarried in UAH ,328 i.e. that the Bank not only reports assets and liabilities in \nUAH but (contrary to the Bank’s case) it accounts for them in UAH too. \nWhile Mr Thompson speculates329 that there may be another explanation for \nthe limited movement from year to year by reference to other factors, the Bank has not produced one.  \n \n325  Reply/48.1 {A1/25/77} \n326  Reply/47.2 {A1/25/77 } \n327  Reply/47.3 {A1/25/77} \n328  Davidson3 /2.41(3)  {D2/20/26 }; FAJS2/5.2 { D4/2/12} \n329  FAJS2/5.1 {D4/2/12} \nAA3/1/106\n \n101  314.

It is not \nentitled, as a matter of law, to claim loss of income it would have \nreceived had the contract been performed.  This appears to be common \nground, since (i) the Bank has not advanced any claim to lost fee income; (ii) such a claim would be inconsistent with its claim to be \nentitled to compound interest as damages (representing the use value of \nthe sums advanced) ;\n330 and (iii) in any event, placing reliance upon fees \npayable under the Relevant Loans331 would be inconsistent with the \nBank’s case that the Relevant Loans were shams and are void.  \n(b) The Bank pleads that Mr Dubilet and/or Ms Gurieva acting on the direct or indirect instructions of D1- 2 caused the indexation fees to be \nremoved or capped in relation to at least some of the UAH Relevant Loans.\n332 Even if this allegation can be made good, and even if this \nalleged misconduct provided the Bank with a cause of action, that is \nseparate from any cause of action sued upon in these proceedings which \nis restricted to a claim for loss in res pect of the Relevant Drawdown. \n(2) As for the currency conversions effected after  the UAH Relevant Drawdowns \nhad been advanced to the Relevant Borrowers, these are entirely separate, \nstand -alone, transactions with the Bank which could not have caused it any \nloss: \n \n330  Reply/52 { A1/25/79} \n331  As the Bank appears to do in BankOpening/ 633 {AA2/1/248} \n332  Reply/47.2 {A1/25/77} \nAA3/1/107\n \n102  (a) On the Bank’s pleaded case333 it took funds from the Relevant \nBorrowers to purchase USD on the Interbank Foreign Exchange \nMarket, and immediately transferred the USD to the Borrower.  It is not \nsaid that such transactions either exposed the Bank to curren cy risk or \ndepleted any USD  assets. To the contrary, the Bank is likely to have \nmade a profit on any currency conversion, through charging fees and/or from setting exchange rates which gave it a margin on the trade (i.e. \nselling the USD for more than it co st to purchase them). \n(b) If the Bank had not needed to purchase USD to sell to the Relevant \nBorrower but had been able to use its own reserves, then the price paid \nfor the foreign currency by the Relevant Borrower would have been \nsufficient to enable the Bank  immediately to replace its funds by \npurchasing USD in the market.  \nJ4. D1’\nS POSITION  \n315. It is common ground334 that:  \n(1) The presentational currency of the Bank’s financial statements was UAH. The experts agree that whether the Bank’s assets and liabilities were denom inated \nin US D or  UAH, they were reported in UAH, including Relevant \nDrawdowns .\n335 Hence for every USD drawdown, the Bank maintained a \nrecord of the UAH equivalent (and not vice versa336). \n(2) The Bank’s functional currency is UAH. Under International Financial \nReporting Standards Functional Currency is \" the currency of the primary \neconomic environment in which the entity operates \" (IAS 21) . The Bank \noperates in UAH.  \n \n333  Reply/47.3.1- 47.3.2 { A1/25/77}  \n334  Reply/48.1 {A1/25/77}  \n335  FAJS2/5.2(3) {D4/2/12 } \n336  There was no record of the USD equivalent of UAH drawdowns.  \nAA3/1/108\n \n103  316.

The Bank suggests that it is simply a matter of common sense to conclude that where it lent USD, it suffered a direct loss in USD.\n339 However, while the currency \nof a Relevant Drawdown identifies the amount which the Bank did not receive back because the contract of loan was not performed by the Relevant Borrower, this is \nthe currency of its contractual loss. The currency of the Relevant Drawdown does \nnot itself necessarily identify the tortious loss to the Bank which is to be measured \nby the cost to the Bank of advancing the funds.  \n319. In the case of a Bank whose functional currency is UAH, it is to be inferred (in the absence of evidence to the contrary) that it had to purchase USD using UAH before \nit was in a position to lend USD. \n320. Further, i f the Bank would otherwise be able to claim it had felt a loss in USD when \nmaking USD Relevant Drawdowns, D1 relies on the fact that New Loans advanced \nonly in  UAH in late 2016 repaid these loans.\n340   \n321. D1’s primary case is that the New Loans repaid the Relevant Loans and with that \nrepayment, D1’s liability was extinguished. If the Bank suffered any loss it was a \ndifferent loss caused by the advanc e of New Loans. The Bank rejects  this analysis \ncontending that New Loans “ stand to be ignored”. If D1’s Repayment Defence fails \n \n337  Davidson3, Section 2C  {D2/20/24} \n338  Davidson3/2.36- 2.39 {D2/20/25 } \n339  BankOpening/634 {AA2/1/249} \n340  D1 Defence/83G(2) {A1/8/49 } \nAA3/1/109\n \n104  for this reason, the New Loans remain relevant to the Currency Issue because (as \nthe Bank recognised in its financial statements341) they h ad the effect of \n“converting” USD -denominated loans to UAH -denominated loans, i.e. any loss in \nUSD was replaced with a loss in UAH.   \n322. This was not just a matter of bookkeeping: the UAH advanced by the New Borrowers to the Relevant Borrowers was converted i nto USD and used by the \nRelevant Borrowers to repay their debt to the Bank. As the Bank positively asserts:  \n“Where a purported repayment of a Relevant Loan was denominated in a currency \nother than that of the Relevant Loan, the repayment was converted \ncontemporaneously into the loan currency on the date when the purported repayment \nwas made. ”342 \n323. The Bank misses the point when it notes that the Transformation shows that the \nBank’s loss caused by USD Relevant Drawdowns was a USD loss which had to be repaid in U SD.\n343 Of course, the Relevant Drawdown had to be repaid in USD as a \nmatter of contract, and the cost of acquiring the necessary amount of USD was measured in UAH according to the exchange rate at the time of repayment. \nHowever, the issue is not the currency  of the contractual obligation but the currency \nof the tortious loss. If the Bank had suffered a USD loss when it funded the USD Relevant Drawdown, that loss was mitigated by the repayment of the Relevant \nDrawdowns in USD. The Bank  is entitled to the cost of its mitigation  which is the \ncost of the UAH it had to use in 2016 to make good that USD tortious loss .  \n324. Accordingly, insofar as the Bank’s loss under USD Relevant Drawdowns had \ninitially been felt in USD, that ceased to be the case at Transformation, wh en it in \nfact received USD from the Relevant Borrowers in (purported, on the Bank’s case) \nrepayment of the Relevant Loans.

The effect of this ‘conversion’ of USD Relevant Drawdowns from 2016 has not yet \nbeen calculat ed by the experts.  \nJ4(2)  UAH Relevant Drawdowns  \n326. The Bank’s functional currency was UAH. There can be no suggestion that the \nBank incurred a cost in any other currency when it advanced UAH to Relevant \nBorrowers. As noted above, the indexation provision in the Rel evant Loans and the \nsubsequent use of the UAH to purchase USD is irrelevant to the currency in which \nthe Bank felt the loss.  The Bank was not expecting USD to be returned, nor did it \nincur a loss in USD when advancing the UAH to the Relevant Borrower.  \n327. Unless it can be demonstrated that the Bank actually felt its loss in USD, the  effect \nof converting both the amount of the Relevant Drawdown and the repayment into USD on the dates of each transaction is to create an artificial loss in USD as a result \nof the depreciation of the UAH in the meantime.\n344 \nJ5. THE FIGURES  \nJ5(1)  The UAH -only Approach  \n328. Mr Davidson has calculated what the value of the Bank’s claim would be in USD (and in GBP), before the application of any credit for repayments, if the  Relevant \nDrawdown Portions all caused a loss  in UAH.\n345 As stated in Table 2 -3: \n(1) The UAH- only value of the claim was UAH 19,419,974,381; and  \n(2) This is the equivalent of GBP 521,323,016 at the date of the Claim Form.  \n329. This is the value of the claim before:  \n \n344  D1 Defence/83E { A1/8/48} ; Reply/49.5 { A1/25/78}  \n345  Davidson3/2.52 {D2/20/30}  \nAA3/1/111\n \n106  (1) any credit in respect of the Repayment Defence o r Use of Funds Defence; and  \n(2) any addition of interest found due.  \nJ5(2)  The UAH/USD Approach  \n330. Mr Davidson has calculated the value of the Bank’s claim if  the Court should \nconclude that the Bank felt its loss in the currency of the  Relevant Drawd owns.346 \nAs stated in Table 2 -4: \n(1) The UAH  part of the claim was UAH 8,555,460,157 and the USD part of the \nclaim is 1,158,097,397; and  \n(2) This is the equivalent of GBP 1,095,801,317 at the date of the Claim Form.  \n331. Accordingly, while adopting the UAH/USD Approach would not reduce the Bank’s \nclaim as dramatically as the UAH -only Approach, it would still result in a starting \npoint for the Bank’s loss calculation approximately GBP £333 million lower than the figure  of around GBP 1.43 billion stated on the Bank’s Claim Form.  \n332. Again, this starting point is before any reductions on account of D1’s Defences. \nK. TRANSFERRED ASSET -  VALUATION ISSUES  \nK1. INTRODUCTION  \n333. The Restructuring Plan was approved by the NBU on 23 February  2016 in \nResolution 103 B/T.347 It required, among other things, the transfer of at least UAH \n31.13 billion in assets (set out in Annex A to the resolution) onto the Bank’s balance \nsheet (the “ Asset Transfer”). \n334.

It is not in dispute that:  \n(1) the NBU was required (p ursuant to Resolution 103/BT ) to verify the value of \nthe assets to be transferred to the Bank as part of the Asset Transfer; and  \n(2) the NBU did so (in large part at least) by requiring the Bank to provide it with \nvaluations from pre -approved independent valuers and validating valuations \n(the “NBU Validated Valuations ”). \n336. When the Mortgage / Pledge Agreements were enforced, and Transferred A ssets \nwere received by the Bank, credit was granted in return for them and applied to \nreduce the amount outstanding under the secured loans. \n337. The Bank refers to the amounts stated in the Mortgage Agreements as the “ Credit \nValue ”.348 However, what matters is the amount for which the Bank gave credit in \nreturn for each Transferred Asset and this “ Credit Value ” (which is what appears in \nthe Transactional Data) may be different349 as a result of the NBU adjusting \nvaluations prior to their approval. \n338. It is common ground that Asset Transfer was a valid repayment. The only issues \nare the following:  \n(1) Must the Bank give full credit for the “ Credit Value ” as D1 contends?  \n(2) If the “ Credit Value ” can be ignored as a matter of Ukrainian Law, as the \nBank contends, what is the “ true” value of the Transferred Assets as \ndetermined by the experts instructed by the parties in these proceedings or otherwise?  \n339. The expert evidence on the valuation of Transferred Assets is only relevant if the \nprior issue of Ukrainian Law is determined i n the Bank’s favour and the Bank is \npermitted to challenge the Credit Values, even where supported by NBU Validated \nValuations.  \n \n348  Reply/27F.4.2 {A1/25/40}  \n349  D1 Defence/41(9) { A1/8/24}  \nAA3/1/113\n \n108  340. It is D1’s case that there is no good reason to second- guess the Credit Values, given \nthat the NBU was involved in validating the underlying valuations. \n341. Mr Beketov also accepts that, where a Transferred Asset has been sold, prima facie \ncredit should be given for the sale price, although Mr Beketov says that this is not \nan absolute rule.350 \n342. If it becomes necessary to consider the exp ert evidence, then it will also be \nnecessary to consider  the values recorded in the Mortgage Agreements (the Original \nValuations), the NBU Validated V aluations, and the subsequent valuations for the \nvarious assets entered into the Bank’s 2016 Financial Sta tements ( see Appendix C \nwhich sets out details of the various valuations of the assets discussed below, including those in the Financial Statements).  \n343. There are a number of different types of Transferred Assets. Set out below is a table summarising the Cred it Values, the Experts’ valuations and the differences between \nthem.  \n344. The “Credit Value ” reflects the value of all Transferred Assets in this category \nwhereas the Experts have valued only those which are Relevant Loan Transferred Assets or Intermediary Loan Transferred Assets.  \n345.

THE PETROL STATIONS  \n347. Among the Transferred Assets were a number of Petrol Stations. 246 of these were \nRelevant Loan Transferred Assets and/or Intermediary Loan Transferred Assets. \nThe value of 183 Petrol Stations was used to repay Relevant Loans; the value of \n \n352 Ibid (the two additional OSFs are valued at Bezant 2(Transferred Assets)/2.3 at UAH 18m \n{D26/1/6}; and at Kaczmarek  Supplemental  2/200 { D27/1/63}  \n353  PSOSFJS/3.1 { D25/1/6}  \n354  Ibid  \n355  Joint Statement on the Airfield, Training Centre and Football Stadium  (“ATCJS”)/3.1 { D22/1/6}   \n356  Ibid  \n357 Ibid  \n358  Second Joint Statement on Aircraft Valuation(“ AJS2 ”)/3.1-3.2 { D15/2/6}  \nAA3/1/115\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n 115 was used to repay Intermediate Loans; and the value of 52 was used to repay \nboth Relevant and Intermediary Loans.359  \nK2(1)  The Petrol Stations – The NBU Validated Valuations \n348. The NBU Validated Valuations  for 199 of the 246 petrol stations had  a total value \nof UAH 4,958 million. The remaining 49 petrol stations were valued by the valuers \nBaker Tilly and UCE  at UAH 1,188 million.360 This amounts to UAH 6,146 million.  \nK2(2)  The Petrol Station - The Experts’ Valuations (DCF) \n349. There are three issues that substantially affect the part ies’ Experts’ valuations of the \npetrol stations on a DCF basis:  \n(1) Which Fuel Sales Data to use in determining the Free Cash Flow. \n(2) The significance and applicability of the concept of the Return on New \nInvested Capital ( “RONIC” ). \n(3) The applicable Country Risk Premium to be incorporated in the discount rate. \nK2(3)  The Appropriate Fuel Sales Data  \n350. It is common ground that the differing Fuel Sales Data used by the Experts accounts \nfor a difference of c. UAH 3,100 million between the Experts’ valuations. \n351. There is a dispute regarding the value of the respective sets of data used by the \nexperts.  Mr Kaczmarek has based his valuation on fuel sales volume data relating \nto the 246 Petrol Stations for 2015 and H1 2016.361 Mr Bezant has used data \nproduced by the valuation firm  Volyn when, in 2018, it produced a restated \n359 Bezant1(Transfer red  Assets)/1.18  {D19/1/8}.

Volyn used data derived \nfrom:  \n(1) “the results of field studies ”; and  \n(2) “estimation of fuel sales volumes from comparable petrol stations ”.362 \n352. Those data were t hen “rolled back ” from 2018 values to provide figures which \nVolyn then applied to its valuation as at 31 December 20 16.363 \n353. If the Court is required to consider the ‘actual value’ of the 246 Petrol Stations in \n2016, the question for the Court is  which are the most appropriate Fuel Sales Data \nto use in the DCF calculation: the data from 2015 and H1 2016 used by Veritas and \nUCE for their valuations , or data extrapolated by Volyn from their “ field studie s” \nand estimated fuel sales volumes of comparables, which have then been “rolled \nback ” to 2016?  \nK2(4)  Return on New Invested Capital (RONIC)  \n354. The second difference between the Experts in determining the inputs into their DCF \ncalculations relates to the inclusion (or not) of a value for the RONIC.  \n355. In simple terms, Mr Bezan t includes a figure in his cost calculation for capital \ninvestment, but then assumes that capital investment produces no additional \nprofit.364 \n356. The effect of Mr Bezant’s approach is artificially to increase the costs inputted to the DCF model (and thereby red uce the businesses profitability).  \n357. Mr Kaczmarek says that it is economically illogical to include an arbitrary assumption that a business would invest capital which produces no return.\n365 \n \n362  Bezant1 (Transferred Assets)/ 4.27 {D19/1/52}  \n363  Bezant1 (Transferred Assets)/ 4.28 {D19/1/53}  \n364  Kaczmarek2 /78 {D21/1/30}  \n365  Kaczmarek2 /30 {D21/1/14}  \nAA3/1/117\n \n112  358. Reversing Mr Bezant’s assumptions with respect to RONIC increases his DCF \ncalculation from UAH  1.9 billion to UAH 2.4 billion, i .e. an increase of UAH 500 \nmillion.366  \nK2(5)  Country Risk Premium  \n359. In determining a discount rate, Mr Bezant applied a Country Risk Premium (“CRP ”) which is derived from the spread between US Treasury Bonds and, in this \ncase, Ukrainian Government Bonds.  \n360. Mr Kaczmarek argues that such an exercise yields an overall country risk, but not a sector specific risk (which is lower).\n367 He points to a host of academic literature \nwhich demonstrates the inadequacies of simply applying a bond yield spread and which deprecates its inappropriate use.\n368  \n361. The effect of reducing the discount rate, by reducing the CRP, is to increase Mr \nBezant’s valuation from UAH 1.9 bi llion to UAH 2.2 billion, i .e. by UAH 300 \nmillion.369 \nK2(6)  Conclusions on DCF Valuations  \n362. Mr Kaczmarek summarises the effect of the three issues discussed above as follows:  \n“After making these three changes in combination, Mr Bezant ’s DCF Model \nproduces an adjuste d value conclusion of UAH 7.9 billion, nearly UAH 1.6 billion \nhigher than the Fair Values for the Petrol Stations originally recorded on the Bank ’s \n2016 financial statements of UAH 6.3 billion. ”370 \nK2(7)  The Petrol Stations -  Mr Kaczmarek’s Valuation (Market Appro ach) \n363.

As such my Fair Value conclusion under the Market Approach for \nthe 246 Petrol Stations is US$307,500,000 or UAH 8,360,002,005 at the prevailing exchange rate of 27.2 UAH/USD as of 31 December 2016” .\n372 \n364. Having explained his reasoning, Mr Kaczmarek considered that his DCF valuation \nand his Market Approach valuation should be given equal weighting, resulting in a \nconclusion that the Fair Value for the 246 Petrol Stations as at 31 December 20 16 \nwas UAH 8.444 billion.373  \nK2(8)  The Petrol Stations -  Mr Kaczmarek’s Cross -Check  \n365. As a cross -check on the reasonableness of his valuation of the Petrol Stations, Mr \nKaczmarek has provided det ails of the values assigned, by the Permanent Court of \nArbitration, to 47 petrol stations expropriated as a result of the annexation of Crimea , and for which Mr Kaczmarek had prepared valuations . The Court had \nretained its own independent expert to review Mr Kaczmarek’s original valuations. The results are best set out in Kaczmarek2 /193- 194.\n374 In summary they provide \nthe Court with substantial comfort that both Mr Kaczmarek’s valuation on the DCF Approach and the Market Approach are reasonable. \nK3. T\nHE OIL STORAGE FACILITIES  \n366. The Transferred Assets included 72 OSFs which were transferred to the Bank in \nsatisfaction of a number of the Relevant Loans and the Intermediary Loans. The \nvalue of 56 OSFs was used to repay Relevant Loans; the value of 17 OSFs was used  \nto repay Intermediate Loans; and the value of 1 OSF was used to repay both \nRelevant and Intermediary Loans.375 \n \n371  Kaczmarek2 /181 {D21/1/64}  \n372  Kaczmarek2 /182 {D21/1/64}  \n373  Kaczmarek2 /191 {D21/1/67}  \n374  Kaczmarek2  {D21/1/67}  \n375  Bezant2 (Transferred Assets)/ 1.18 {D19/1/8}   \nAA3/1/119\n \n114  K3(1)  Oil Storage Facilities (OSFs) – The NBU Validated Valuation  \n367. The EY Report indicates that the NBU Validated Valuations  for 36 OSFs  were  \nUAH 1,314 million, and a further 84 OSFs were recorded with a Value at Initial \nRecognition of UAH 6,447 million.  \nK3(2)  The OSFs -  The Experts’ Valuations  \n368. Mr Kaczmarek valued the OSFs on a DCF basis. His overall valuation was UAH 2,370 billion. That is approxim ately 58% less than the valuation recorded by the \nBank of UAH 5,585 million, but consistent with the reductions recommended in the 2016 EY Report and by the NBU.\n376 Mr Kaczmarek  used the same fuel \nthroughput data as used by Baker Tilley when it produced its OSFs valuation for the Bank in 2016.  \n369. Mr Bezant does not rely upon the data used by Baker Tilly and so did not carry out \na DCF valuation. Instead he values the OSFs on a Market Approach, based on the \nauction prices achieved for 42 OSFs sold by the Bank between July 2019 and \nOctober 2021, which Mr Bezant himself acknowledges is an unorthodox \napproach.\n377 \n370. The issue for the Court is therefore whether it is right to regard  the throughput data \nused by Baker Tilly as  the best available data, such that  an Income App roach is the \nmost appropriate valuation approach.  \nK4.

In the absence of any available operational or financial data in relation to the \nStadium, Mr Kaczmarek valued it using a Cost  Approach, as Veritas had done in \n2016 and whose valuation was verified by the NBU.379 Adopting that approach, he \nvalued it at UAH 1,544 million .380  \n373. Mr Thomas has reject ed the Cost Approach and, again, despite the acknowledged \npaucity of the data available to him,381 has carried out an income based approach, \nrelying on publicly available data and on data extracted from ear lier valuation \nreports.  \n374. Mr Thomas’s approach produces a valuation for the Stadium of UAH 125.4 \nmillion,382 approximately 8% of the NBU Validated Valuation.  \nK5. THE TRAINING CENTRE  \n375. The issue s in relation to the Training Centre are virtually identical to those that arise \nin relation to the Stadium.  \nK5(1)  The Training Centre – The NBU Validated  Valuation  \n376. The NBU verified the value of the Training Centre at UAH 332 million.383  \nK5(2)  The Training Centre – The Experts’ Valuations  \n377. Mr Thomas again carried out an Income Approach valuation, resulting in a value \nof UAH 104.9 million.384  \n378. Mr Kaczmarek, for the same reasons explained above in relation to the Dnipro Stadium, says that the Cost Approach is the appropriate one to use, and therefore \n \n379  The Bank was required to prepare its Financial Statements in accordance with I RFS13: \nKaczmarek1/47 {D24/1/19}  \n380  Kaczmarek1 /255 {D20/1/78}  \n381  See, for convenience, the extracts from Mr Thomas ’s report quoted at Kaczmarek1/251  {D20/1/77}  \nand A TCJS/7.2  {D22/1/12}  \n382  Kaczmarek1 /246 {D20/1/76}  \n383  Kaczmarek1 /262 {D20/1/81}  \n384  Kaczmarek1 /265 {D20/1/81}  \nAA3/1/121\n \n116  values the Training Centre in accordance with the value verified by the NBU, UAH \n332 million.  \nK6. THE AIRFIELD  \n379. The issues in relation to the Airfield follow the same pattern.  \nK6(1)  The Airfield – The NBU Validated Valuation  \n380. The NBU verified the value of the Airfield as UAH 34 million.385  \nK6(2)  The Airfield – The Experts’ Valuations  \n381. Mr Thomas, while again acknowledging a lack of data, carried out his own Income \nApproach valuation, resulting in a value of UAH 5.7 million.386  \n382. Mr Kaczmarek, for the same reasons explained above in relation to the Dnipro Stadium, says that the Cost Approach is the appropriate one to use and therefore \nvalues the Airfield in accordance with the value verified by the NBU, UAH 34 \nmillion.  \nK7.

Mr Kaczmarek considered the report apparently underlying the NBU Validated \nValuation, by Kreston, and considered it acceptable and therefore adopted its, and \nthe NBU’s, valuation of UAH 212 million.  \n390.

HOTEL ZIRKA  \nK9(1)  Hotel Zirka – The NBU Validated Valuation   \n391. The NBU verified the value of Hotel Zirka a s UAH 1,693 million.393  \nK9(2)  Hotel Zirka – The Experts ’ Valuations  \n392. Prior to the NBU’s verification of t he value of Hotel Zirka, as UAH 1,693 million, \nvarious valuations were commissioned by the Bank, the latest of which was a report by Veritas in August 2016, which valued the hotel at UAH 1,617 million.  \n393. Both Experts agree that there are clear errors in Ver itas’s valuation model.\n394 In \nparticular, Veritas did not deduct corporation income tax when projecting Hotel \nZirka’s cash flows and used a post -tax discount rate with pre -tax cash flows. In \naddition, Veritas used a US Dollar denominated discount rate to dis count local \ncurrency, UAH, denominated cash flows.  \n394. Mr Bezant created his own DCF model, correcting for errors, and arrived at a valuation for the main hotel of UAH 1,072 million. Mr Kaczmarek  considers Mr \nBezant’s methodology and assumptions to be reasona ble and agrees with the \nvaluation for the main hotel.\n395  \n395. There is a single point of disagreement between the experts as to whether any value should be attributed to the ancillary buildings or not. Mr Bezant’s position is that \nnone should be.\n396 Mr Kaczmarek explains why he disagrees as follows:  \n“Mr. Bezant considers the building to have no value because it is used in the \noperation of the main hotel complex – apparently to house employees.

However, the disagreement between the Experts in rel ation to the two Airbus \naircraft accounts for USD 14 million of the USD 15.5 million between their \nvaluations.  \n402. Of that USD 14 million, c. USD 10.6 million turns on a single issue which is the \nStage 1 value as set out in the Aircraft Experts’ Joint Stateme nt. \n403. The starting point for the Aircraft valuation is the “Stage 1” value which is derived from the “ collection and analysis of aircraft transaction data to produce a \nnormalised value for a generic aircraft of that particular type with an assumed basic spec ification as at the valuation date ”.\n401 \n404. Ms Razzhivina, the Bank’s Expert, has calculated the Stage 1 value of the two Airbus aircraft “based on the data points described and analyzed in OR1/Appendix \nI/117- 150 [and OR2/Appendix B/B4- B6]\n402 as well as Ms Razzhivina’s market \nknowledge. This value was published in the OrielVIP online platform and valid in August 2016”.  \n405. Mr Seymour, D1’s Expert, calculated the Stage 1 value:  \n“…based on Mr Seymour ’s market knowledge and was published in the IBA A VB \n(PS1 Appendi x 17). The market value provided was only slightly below the Base \nValue given the opinion published in the A VB at the time which was ‘ The A321 -200 \nperformed well under various market conditions ’”.403 \n406. Resolving the appropriate starting point for the valuation of the two Airbus aircraft \nwill resolve c.68% of the difference in the Experts’ valuations of the Aircraft. \n \n401  Razzhivina1/42(a) {D13/1/24 } \n402  In relation to the second Airbus  \n403   AJS2/ 4.6, 4.10 {D15/2/8}  and {D15/2/10}  \nAA3/1/126\n \n121  L.

There are distinct issues which the Bank has raised in relation to the credit it is \nrequired to give in relation to the two Hotels and the nine Aircraft.  \nL2. THE HOTELS  \n408. The Bank has raised a specific issue in relation to the credit which it should give in \nrelation to the transfer to it of Hotel Mir and Hotel Zirka.  \n409. In particular, the Bank maintains that it is not required to give any credit in relation to: \n(1) Hotel Mir, because the Bank’s title to it has been successfully challenged;\n404 \nand  \n(2) Hotel Zirka, because the Bank’s title to it is currently subject to challenge in \nthe Ukrainian courts.405 \n410. As to Hotel Mir, the Bank is required to give the full credit that it applied to the loan to AEF when title to the hotel was originally transferred to the Bank. While it \nis true that in July 2021, the Ukrainian Courts cancelled the registration of Hotel \nMir in the Bank’s name, that decision is still subject to an appeal by the Cabinet of \nMinisters of Ukraine which is yet to be determined. Moreover, the Bank has not \nsought to reverse the credit which was applied to the loan to AEF when Hotel Mir \nwas originally transferred to it in 2016. \n411. As to Hotel Zirka, while the Bank’s title to the hotel is the subject of extant proceedings, the Bank foreclosed against the hotel in September 2016 and was registered as it s owner. As matters currently stand, the Bank remains the legal \nowner of  Hotel Zirka and is bound by the Credit Value it applied to the Relevant \n \n404  Reply/28M.1 { A1/25/60} \n405  Reply/28M.2 { A1/25/60} \nAA3/1/127\n \n122  Loans in 2016 or, alternatively, the true value of Hotel Zirka as at the date on which \nit was transferred to the Bank.  \nL3. THE AIRCRAFT  \n412. On 22 August 2016, Perser Holdings Lim ited pledged  nine Aircraft to secure the \nrepayment of seven Relevant Loans and three Other Loans (see the Guarantee and Pledge Agreement dated 22  August 2016).\n406 On the same day, the Aircraft were \ntransferred to the Bank and their value was applied to the repayment of the ten \nloans, including seven Relevant Loans.  \n413. On 23 August 2016, the Bank sold the Aircraft to Dilorsano for US D 163m pursuant \nto nine separate transactions, with the price being payable in instalments over time. On 23 August 2016, Dilorsano pledged the A ircraft as security for its performance \nof the sale agreements.  \n414.  The Bank’s position is that it is only obliged to give credit : \n“… for any sums it has in fact recovered from Dilorsano pursuant to its contractual \nrights, limited to (i) any repayments of pri ncipal made by Dilorsano under the \nDilorsano purchase agreements and (ii) any net proceeds of sale recovered from the \nsale of the Aircraft by the Bank pursuant to its rights under the purchase agreements and/or the Dilorsano Pledge ”.\n407 \n415. The Bank’s position i s untenable: title to the nine Aircraft was transferred to the \nBank and the Bank credited the various borrowers’ loan accounts (include seven \nRelevant Loans), thereby discharging the borrowers’ indebtedness. Given that, the \nBank is bound by the credit it has already given to the ten borrowers and which it \nhas not sought to reverse.  \n416. Alternatively, insofar as the Bank is not bound by the credit it has already given in respect of the nine Aircraft transferred to it, it is obliged to give credit for both the \nsums it has received from Dilorsano under the sale agreements and the true value \nof the Aircraft, over whi ch it currently holds security.  \n \n406  Guarantee and Pledge Agreement dated 22 August 20 16 {E15/91/1}  \n407  Reply/28J.2.7 { A1/25/56}  \nAA3/1/128\n \n123  417.

FORENSIC ACCOUNTING ISSUES  \nM1. OVERVIEW  \n418. The Forensic Accountancy experts, Mr Thompson (for the Bank), Mr Davidson (for \nD1) and Mr Steadman (for D2) have analysed the Bank’s Transactional Data and \ncarried out various calculations to reflect the cases advanced by the Bank on the \none hand and the Defendants on the other. \n419. Unsurprisingly, the Experts agree that the material calculations p roduced by each \nother are arithmetically correct. There are, however, some issues to be decided \nwhich will determine which calculations are the right ones to be used to calculate \nthe amount of any loss to the Bank. \n420. For the purposes of these written Opening  Submissions, the issues are presented \nonly in broad outline. \n421. A broad brush “Decision Tree” has been prepared to assist the Court in obtaining \nan overview of the key issues that affect any quantum calculations. This is attached \nas Appendix G . \nM2. THE STARTING POINT  \n422. There are two issues discussed above that affect the starting point for the Forensic Accountants’ analysis:  \n(1) The Limitation Defence (see Section I  above); and  \n(2) The Currency Issue (see Section J above). \n \n408  BankOpening/621- 623 { AA2/1/243} \nAA3/1/129\n \n124  423. The Court’s ruling on the Limitation Defence will determine whether the Bank can \nassert any of its claims at all, or (even if it can assert most of its claims) whether it \ncan maintain claims in relation to the Relevant Drawdowns  made by the Cypriot \nBorrowe rs and Prominmet. \n424. In respect of those claims not barred by limitation, the Court’s ruling on the \nCurrency Issue is needed before the correct starting point for the necessary \ncalculations can be established.  \n425. There is a third issue that affects the starting point of the Forensic Accountants’ analysis which is effectively a pleading issue.  This will determine  whether the \nBank’s claim is advanced in relation to the full amount of the USD 2.33 billion Relevant Drawdowns or only in respect of the USD 1.91 billion of Relevant \nDrawdown Portions (those parts of Relevant Drawdowns which it can identify as \nhaving caused or funded Unreturned Prepayments). Despite what the Bank now \nsays, the answer is clear from the first page of the trial bundle: in its Claim Form,\n409 \nthe Bank claims USD 1,911,877,385 which is the precise amount of the Unreturned \nPrepayments .  \nM3. THE BANK’S METHODOLOGY – IDENTIFYING RELEVANT DRAWDOWNS (AND \nRELEVANT DRAWDOWN PORTIONS ) \n426. The methodology used by the Bank to identify the Relevant Drawdowns is a matter \nfor the Bank. D1 does not engage with the Bank on this matter except in relation to \nthe pleading issue which concerns whether the claim has been advanced in relation \nto the whole amount of the Relevant Drawdowns or only in respect of those parts \nof them which funded Unreturned Prepayments.  \n427. The Bank’s Transactional Data records against certain movements of money details \nof the transaction to which they are related.  In particular, certain entries  recorded in \nthe Transactional Data are annotated with Su pply Agreement reference numbers.  \n \n409  Claim Form { A/1/1 } \nAA3/1/130\n \n125  428.

In particular, certain entries  recorded in \nthe Transactional Data are annotated with Su pply Agreement reference numbers.  \n \n409  Claim Form { A/1/1 } \nAA3/1/130\n \n125  428. The Bank uses these narrative descriptions to link together transactions. In this way, \ndespite intervening deposits and payments, and despite sometimes lengthy periods \nof time between trans actions, by linking transactions bearing a particular Supply \nAgreement reference number, a drawdown by a Borrower is identified by the Bank \nas being the source of the Unreturned Prepayments. These drawdowns are the \nRelevant Drawdowns.  \n429. This is the basis upon which the Bank claims that the se Relevant Drawdowns \n“caused ” or (as Mr Thompson prefers to say410) “funded ” an Unreturned \nPrepayment. This method of linking Relevant Drawdowns to Unreturned Prepayments is referred to as “ Supply Agreement Tracing ” using  the “Bank’s \nMethodology” . \n430. The total  amount of the Relevant Drawdowns (the equivalent of USD \n2,335,943,519) is significantly greater than the amount of the Unreturned Prepayments (USD 1,911,877,835).  \n431. The difference between the two sums is USD 424,055,750. Accordingly, it is obvious that not  the whole of every Relevant Drawdown can have funded an \nUnreturned Prepayment.  \n432. As Mr Thom pson explained, the  amount of Relevant Drawdowns  exceeds the \namount of Unreturned Prepayments largely because some Relevant Drawdowns \nfunded the repayment of other Re levant Drawdowns as well as Unreturned \nPrepayments.\n411  \n433. The concept of a Relevant Drawdown Portion can be graphically illustrated by \nreference to the hypothetical example presented by Mr Thompson in his First \nReport.412 \n \n410  Thompson1/2.2(a) { D1/1/23} \n411  Thompson1/4.73, Note (2) to Table 4- 7 {D1/1/137 } \n412  Thompson1/Figure 3 -3 “Steps 1 to 6 of the Bank ’s case (hypot hetical example) ” {D1/1/40 } \nAA3/1/131\n \n126   \n434. Step 6 in the analysis is an Unreturned Prepayment to a Supplier in the amount of \nUSD 50m. Two Relevant Drawdowns contribute to that payment: a first Relevant \nDrawdown of USD 50m at Step 1 and a second of USD 30m at Step 3. As can be \nseen, the full amount of the second Relevant Drawdown of USD 30m contributes \nto the Unreturned Prepayment in combination with only USD 20m of the first. \nAccordingly, the Relevant Drawdown Portion of the first is USD 20m (or 40%) and \nthe Relevant Drawdown Portion of the second is USD 30m (or 100%).  \n435. On this example, the balance of USD 20m from the second Relevant Drawdown is \nnot part of the Bank’s claim because it is not used to fund an Unreturned \nPrepayment.  \n436. It is the Bank’s Methodology which is used to identify Relevant Drawdowns and the Relevant Drawdown P ortions (i.e. those parts of each Relevant Drawdown \nwhich funded an Unreturned Prepayment). Mr Thompson has calculated the Relevant Drawdown Portions and these are agreed as a starting point if, as D1 \nclaims it should be, the Bank’s claim is confined to Re levant Drawdown \nPortions.\n413  \n \n413  These are set out in Thompson3, Appendix 5 -1-1 {D1/452/1}   \nAA3/1/132\n \n127  M4. WHAT LOSS IS THE BANK CLAIMING ? \n437. It is a necessary part of its claim in unjust enrichment against D3 -D8 for the Bank \nto establish causative/transactional links between the Relevant Drawdowns and the \nUnreturned Prepayments.414 The expense to the Bank in (indirectly415) funding the \nUnreturned Prepayments is, of course, the same amount of the Unreturned Prepayments and the Bank acknowledges that in relation to the Relevant \nDrawdowns, only “ a portion of [them] caused the Unreturned Prepay ments ”.\n416  \n438. While the claim in unjust enrichment does not concern D1 because no such claim \nis made against him, w hat matters, so far as he  is concerned, is the identification of \nthe advances of funds  (or parts thereof) which are alleged to have caused the Bank \nloss and for which it advances a claim against him in tort ."}
{"start": 266000, "text": " amount of the Unreturned Prepayments and the Bank acknowledges that in relation to the Relevant \nDrawdowns, only “ a portion of [them] caused the Unreturned Prepay ments ”.\n416  \n438. While the claim in unjust enrichment does not concern D1 because no such claim \nis made against him, w hat matters, so far as he  is concerned, is the identification of \nthe advances of funds  (or parts thereof) which are alleged to have caused the Bank \nloss and for which it advances a claim against him in tort . \n439. The whole amount of the Relevant Drawdowns (USD 2,335,943,519) is not alleged to have been misappropriated. The Bank alleges that D1 and D2 are liable for \nprocuring the Unreturned Prepayments a nd that , in order  to do so, they \n“misappropriated $1,911,877,365 of the Bank’s monies ”.\n417   \n440. It is therefore necessary to identify in respect of each Relevant Drawdown, which \npart of it is alleged to have funded the Unreturned Prepayments in order to \nunderstand what the Bank is claiming was misappropriated by D1.  \n441. Hence, D1 contends that the proper starting point for the Forensic Accountants is the set of Relevant Drawdown Portions calculated by Mr Thompson. Having \nidentified the advances of funds which are alleged to have caused the Bank loss, it \nis then necessary to consider D1’s Defences and how much credit should be applied \nto reflect the repayment of those sums. \n442. Nevertheless, the Bank maintains in its Reply\n418 that: \n \n414  BankOpening/532 { AA2/1/209}  \n415  Reply/25.6 {A1/25/33}  \n416  Claim/16 {A1/2/7 }; see also  Bank ’s Further Information provided on 22 May 2020 in response to \nD1’s RFI dated 21 April 2020 {A2/9/1 } \n417  Claim/52(1) {A1/2/29 } \n418  Reply/27B.4.1 { A1/25/3 6} \nAA3/1/133\n \n128  “It is denied that the Bank claims that only part  of the Relevant Drawdowns caused \nit loss. It is the Bank ’s case that the Relevant Drawdowns caused it a loss in the sum \nclaimed. ” \n443. In its Opening Submissions, the Bank suggests the Bank’s loss can be calculated \nby “looking at either the net Relevant Drawdowns or the total of the Unreturned \nPrepayments which they funded”.419  \n444. The Bank argues that there is no anomaly in insisting that its claim is in respect of the whole amount of the Relevant Drawdowns by reference to the fact that after \ngiving c redit for the value of repayments of Relevant Drawdowns by Relevant \nDrawdowns, the “ net Relevant Drawdowns ”\n420 claimed is USD 1,951,729,318.  \n445. In his First Report, Mr Thompson’s calculation of loss started with the amount of \n“Net Unreturned Prepayments ” (i.e.  USD 1,911,877,385).421 The sum of USD \n1,951,729,318 was merely a calculation produced by Mr Thompson by way of a “cross- check ”\n422 and is the difference between USD 2,335,943,519 and USD \n384,214,201 being the “ value of repayments of Relevant Drawdowns by Relev ant \nDrawdowns ”.   \n446. While the amounts of USD 1,911,877,365 and USD 1,951,729,318 happen to be \nsimilar, this is a matter of coincidence and the larger sum is the result of the wrong \nenquiry. I t remains the Bank’s case that “the sums misappropriated from the B ank \nthrough the Relevant Drawdowns were used to fund the Unreturned Prepayments ”.\n423 What needs to be excluded from the amount of USD \n2,335,943,519 is not the amount of Relevant Drawdowns  ultimately “ repaid ” by \nRelevant Drawdowns as such but all parts of Relevant Drawdowns used for other purposes (including those parts used “ to repay ” Relevant Drawdowns ).  \n \n419  BankOpening/531 {AA2/1/209} \n420  A previously undefined term appearing in BankOpening/524(2), fn 470 { AA2/1/20 6} \n421  See Thompson1/7.12, Table 7- 2 “Calculation of Loss ” {D1/1/281} \n422  See Thompson1/7.13, Table 7- 3 “Summary of the Cross- Check ” {D1/1/281} \n423  BankOpening/531 {AA2/1/209} \nAA3/1/134\n \n129  447.

The amount of Relevant Drawdowns used “ to repay” Relevant Drawdowns and the \namount of Relevant Drawdowns “ repaid” are of course, numerically the same but \nthey are the sums of different parts of the Relevant Drawdowns .425 \n449. In his Second Report,426 Mr Thompson acknowledged that he could “ allocate \nRelevant Drawdowns to Unreturned Prepayments further ” but he suggested that it \nwould be disproportionate to do so given that the Bank does not claim the \n“unallocated amount ” of USD 39,851,933 (i.e. the difference between USD \n1,951,729,318 and USD 1,911,877,385) . He emphasised  that “the starting point for \nmy calculation of loss in my First Report is the value of the Unreturned \nPrepay ments ”.   \n450. In his Third Report,427 Mr Thompson breaks down the sum of USD 2,335,943,519 \ninto the various uses of those funds (identified using the Bank’s Methodology) \nincluding USD 1,911,877,385 to make Unreturned Prepayments and USD \n384,214,201 used to repay  Relevant Drawdowns together with other amounts used \nfor other purposes.428  \n451. His calculation of “ The loss to the Bank ” continues to start with USD 1,911,877,385 \nbeing the “ Total value of the Thompson Relevant Drawdown Portions ”.429 \n \n424  BankOpening/555(2) {AA2/1/216}  \n425  Naturally, the value of the repayments totaling USD 384,214,201 is equally the sum of either  \n (1) those Relevant Drawdowns (A) which funded the repayment of Relevant Drawdowns (B) or  \n (2) the Relevant Drawdowns (B) whose re payment was funded by Relevant Drawdowns (A) . \n426  Thompson2/3.20- 3.21 {D1/347/23}  \n427  Thompson3/2.5(d) {D1/440/8 } \n428  Other sums accounted for are USD 22,021,532 to repay non -Relevant, non- Intermediary \ndrawdowns; USD 8,768,253 to pay interest and fees; and USD 9,051,764 in respect of FX \ndifferences.  \n429  Thompson3/5.17, Table 5- 4: “Summary of Loss ” {D1/440/70}  \nAA3/1/135\n \n130  452. Relevant Drawdown Portions a re the correct starting point in the analysis but, a s a \nresult of the position maintained by the Bank by which it seeks to increase the claim \nclaimed , it has been necessary for the forensic accountants to consider the \nRepayment Defence and the Use of Funds  Defence by reference to both Relevant \nDrawdowns and Relevant Drawdown Portions. \n453. There is no dispute as to the identification of Relevant Drawdown Portions (which \nfor convenience will be referred to as “RDPs ” below) .430 These have been \ncalculated by Mr Thompson and as indicated above the identification  of the \nDrawdowns (or part thereof) which the Bank claims caused it loss is not a matter \non which D1 engages. \n454. Once they have been identified, D1 then engages with the Bank on the proposition \nthat the Relevant Dr awdowns (or RDPs ) in fact caused the Bank a loss.  \nM5. THE REPAYMENT DEFENCE (DIRECT REPAYMENT ) \nM5(1)  Direct Repayment of Relevant Drawdowns  \n455. The immediate source and amount of repayment of Relevant Drawdowns is a matter \nof record in the Transactional Data.  \n456. There were 270 Relevant Drawdowns under 134 Relevant Loans, totalling  USD \n2,335,943,519.431 \n457.

Using the Bank’s exchange rates, it is common ground that:  \n(1) Relevant Drawdowns under the Tamersa Relevant Loan 4T13351D in the \namount of USD 19.2 million are outstanding; and  \n \n430  These are set out in Thompson3, Appendix 5-1- 1 {D1/452/1}  \n431  FAJS1/2.2(a) { D4/1/4 } \n432  FAJS1/4.1 { D4/1/6 } \nAA3/1/136\n \n131  (2) Relevant Drawdowns under the Prominmet Relevant Loan DNH2LKI04220 \nin the amount of UAH 157 million (the equivalent of USD 18.2 million)433 \nare outstanding.  \n459. Accordingly, if D1’s Repayment Defence is accepted in full (i.e.  Intermediary and \nNew Loans are not ignored and the full Credit Value of each Transferred Asset is \ntaken into account ), D1 contends that the  maximum amount of the Bank’s claim is \nUSD 37.4 million.  \n460. USD 37.4 million was the equivalent of GBP 27,989,051 at the date of the Claim \nForm. The amount of the claim will be  significantly  less if the Bank felt its loss in \nmixed currencies, or exclusively in UAH: GBP 18,599,156 or GBP 8,341,522 respectively .  \nM5(2)  Direct Repayment of Relevant Drawdown Portions  (“RDPs”)  \n461. If the claim is to be assessed at the level of RDPs  then D1 contends that the  \nfollowing sums ( adjusted as necessary  in the currency or currencies which the Court \ndecides is appropriate) represent the Bank’s loss:\n434 \n(1) The outstanding balance under the Tamersa Relevant Loan 4T13351D \nattributable pro rata to the RDP is USD 8.1 million; a nd \n(2) The outstanding balance under the Prominmet Relevant Loan DNH2LKI04220 attributable pro rata to the RDP is UAH 147.4 million (the \nequivalent of USD 17.1 million).  \n462. Accordingly, in this case the maximum amount of the Bank’s loss is USD 25.2 million which was the equivalent of GBP 18,808,772 at the date of the Claim Form.  \n463. Again, i t will be  much  less if the Bank felt its loss in mixed currencies, or \nexclusively in UAH: GBP 12,098,811 or GBP 5,794,709 respectively.\n435 \n \n433  Davidson3/Table 3- 19 {D2/20/61}  \n434  D1 Defence/55B -55C { A1/8/29}  \n435  See FAJS2, Appendix 1, columns 2 and 3 {D4/2/21}  \nAA3/1/137\n \n132  M5(3)  Possible Adjustments (Mr Thompson’s Calcul ation)  \n464. D1 contends that there is no proper basis upon which the Court should either ignore \nrepayments or attribute less value to them than the Bank has attributed in its \nTransactional Data. However, the Bank raises a number of issues concerning \nwhether rep ayments should be taken into account and/ or in what amount. This \nrequires an analysis of the immediate sources of funds used to effect direct \nrepayments.  \n465. Mr Davidson has analysed the direct source of repayment of Relevant Drawdowns \nand of RDPs and presents  his conclusion as follows: Davidson3/Table 3- 1436 \n \n466. A significant issue concerns whether “ Cash” repayments (Intermediary Loans) or \n“Transformation” (New Loans) “stand to be ignored” as a matter of Ukrainian law \n(see Section F  above ).  \n467. So far as the value to  be attributed to repayments made by Transferred Assets is \nconcerned, a number of issues require determination:  \n \n436  Davidson3/3.6 { D2/20/33}  \nAA3/1/138\n \n133  (1) An issue under Ukrainian law arises as to whether the Credit Values ascribed \nto Transferred Assets are to be used in calculating amounts by whic h the \nBank’s loss is to be reduced, or whether only the “ true” value of Transferred \nAssets is to be taken into account ( see Section F 3 above).  \n(2) If only the “ true” value of the Transferred Assets is relevant, then the Forensic \nAccountants will need to know what those “ true” values are before they can \ncalculate the net amount of the Bank’s loss. The Court will d"}

The Court will determine this issue on the basis of the Expert Valuation evidence (s ee Section K ). \n(3) In respect of specific Transferred Assets, the Bank claims that no (or limited) value should be given to them as repayments relying on certain disputed \nfactual allegations (see Section L ). \n468. A further issue involving issues of currency is whether repayments should be accounted for in the currency of repayment or some other currency – and, if some \nother currency, which exchange rate should be used:  \n(1) Mr Davidson has highlighted the anomaly of accounting for UAH \nDrawdowns and repayment of the same in UAH if (as the Bank contends) \nboth transactions are to be converted into USD on the basis that the Bank \nsuffered a USD loss and the reduction in the amount of such a loss must be calculated in USD. Due to the declining value of UAH over time, the full \nrepayment of a UAH Relevant Drawdown would leave the Bank with an \noutstanding loss  measured in USD which seems to be an artificial loss.\n437 \n(2) Mr Davidson’s solution to this artificial problem  - designed to highlight and \ncancel out the artificial loss -  is to deploy what might be regarded as an \nequally artificial device of converting UAH rep ayments into USD using the \nexchange rate that applied at the date of the UAH drawdown. This serves the \npurpose of ensuring that the repayment of a UAH drawdown in the full \namount of UAH effects a complete discharge as was intended and avoids the \n \n437  Davidson3/1.36 {D2/20/14}  \nAA3/1/139\n \n134  anomaly of  the Bank being left with an outstanding loss after a full \nrepayment.438 \n(3) Mr Thompson disagrees. He accepts that there may be a mismatch439 but \ncontends that if the Bank’s loss is measured in a currency different from that \nof the Relevant Drawdown, the loss is not artificial.440 He points out that if \nthe claim is denominated entirely in UAH then repayment of USD Relevant Drawdowns in USD will give the impression that that the Bank has been \noverpaid.\n441 \n(4) The problem is avoided if drawdowns and repayments are accounted for in \ntheir actual currencies and account is taken of actual currency conversions \neffected by the Bank  where necessary to convert repayments into the currency \nof the Relevant Drawdown . However, that does not address the issue of \nidentifying the correct c urrency in which the loss was felt by the Bank. In \nparticular, a loss in USD when an advance is made in UAH is entirely artificial and depends on taking into account an irrelevant foreign exchange \ntransaction which occurs only after a drawdown in UAH has been made: see \nSection J  above.  \nM6. T\nHE REPAYMENT DEFENCE (ULTIMATE SOURCE OF REPAYMENT ) \n469. If the Bank’s contention that repayments by Intermediary Loans and New Loans are to be “ ignored” is accepted by the Court, then (and only then) consideration \nneeds to be gi ven to the ultimate source of repayment of Relevant Drawdowns or \nRDPs. This involves ascertaining whether (and if so how) Intermediary Loans and \nNew Loans were themselves ultimately repaid. The Bank accepts that if these loans \nwere repaid by funds originat ing from outside the Bank then credit should be given \nin the amount of such repayments. \n \n438  Davidson3/3.90 {D2/20/52}  \n439  Thompson4/4.64 {D1/461/52 } \n440  Thompson4/4.58 – 4.59 {D1/461/51}  \n441  Thompson4/4.66 {D1/461/52 } \nAA3/1/140\n \n135  M6(1)  Mr Thompson’s Calculation (Relevant Drawdowns)  \n470.

Ultimately, whichever methodology is applied to identify the source of funds, \nalmost all of the Intermediary Loans were either repaid by Asset Transfer or \nTransformation. The Bank recognizes that Relevant Loans have been repaid to the extent that they were repaid by Intermediary Loans which were themselves repaid \nby Asset Transfer. (The amount of credit will depend on whethe r the Court takes \ninto account the Credit Value ascribed to the Transferred Assets by the Bank at the time of receipt or the value now ascribed to the Transferred Assets on the basis of the Expert Valuation evidence.)  \n471. The Bank gives no credit if the ultima te source of repayment of Relevant Loans or \nIntermediary Loans can be seen to be New Loans (save to the extent they have been \nrepaid by external sources).  \n472. The Bank does not give credit if the ultimate source of repayment cannot be \nidentified as an external  source. It is unclear why Mr Thompson adopts the position \nthat cash repayments of which the ultimate source of funding cannot be identified \nshould not be taken into account either as a matter of fact or Ukrainian law or \naccountancy (see Section F5 , above) . It is assumed that the Bank is inviting the \nCourt to infer  that any money derived from the Bank to repay Relevant Loans must \nhave been derived unlawfully, but quite why that inference should be drawn has not been explained . \n473. On this basis, starting with the amount of the Unreturned Prepayments and taking \ninto account the Bank’s position on the  low value to be ascribed to Transferred \nAssets, and small amounts attributed to FX gains, repayments from external sources \nand repayments of New Loans , Mr Thompson concludes that the Bank has suffered \na loss of USD 1,801,924,650.\n442 \n \n442  Thompson2/6.7, Table 6.1 { D1/347/72}  \nAA3/1/141\n \n136  M6(2)  Mr Davidson’s Alternative Methodology \n474. The analysis will be different according to whether the Bank’s Methodology is used \nor whether Exact Matching (referred to by Mr Thompson as the Alternative \nMethodology ) is used to identify the ultimate source of repayment:443 \n(1) When Mr Thompson refers to the repayment of Relevant Drawdowns from \nparticular ultimate sources , he is referring to the results of an analysis using \nthe Bank’s Methodolo gy of identifying connected payments by using \nnarrative descriptions recorded in the Transactional Data.  \n(2) When Mr Davidson refers to the repayment of Relevant Drawdowns from \nparticular ultimate sources , he is referring to the results of an analysis using \nhis “exact matching” methodology which ignores transaction narratives but \nfollows money in and out of bank accounts.  \n475. Mr Davidson prefers Exact Matching to the Bank’s Methodology. Exact \nMatching444 is a conventional tracing analysis, looking at the direct sourc e of \nmoney into an account before it is paid out . Sums  are followed by identifying exact \nmatches for subsequent transfers where possible. Exact matches can be identified \nby single amounts matching each other or by combining a number of payments in one dire ction (e.g. deposit to an account) with a payment or multiple payments in \nthe other.\n445 \nM6(3)  Repayments of Relevant Drawdowns  \n476.

Mr Thompson started with the full amount of the Relevant Drawdowns, explaining \nthat “ Amounts in the table total USD 2,335.9 million (i.e. the total amount of \nRelevant Drawdowns) and not USD 1,911.9 million (i.e. the total amount of \nUnreturned Prepayments). The amount of Relevant Drawdowns  exceeds the \namount of Unreturned Prepayments largely because (as shown above) some Relevant Drawdowns funded the repayment  of other Relevant Drawdowns as well \nas Unreturned Prepayments ”.447 \n478. Applying Exact Matching, he identified the fact that USD 459.2 million of Relevant \nDrawdowns “ funded the repayment ” of Relevant Drawdowns. Accordingly,  what  \nis now referred to as “Net Relevant Drawdowns ” would be in the region of USD \n1.877 billion if Exact Matching were used.448 This is somewhat less than USD \n1.912 billion (the amount of the Unreturned Prepayments).  \nM6(4)  Repayment of Relevant Drawdown Portions by Relevant Drawdown \nPortions \n479. Mr Davidson presents a comparison of the ultimate source of funds using the Bank’s Methodology and his own in his Third Report.\n449 \n \n447  See Note (2) to Table 4 -7 {D1/1/137} \n448  USD 2,335,9 million less USD 459.2 million = USD 1,876.7 million \n449  Davidson3, Table 3- 2 {D2/20/34} \nAA3/1/143\n \n138   \n480. There is a significant issue between the experts as to whether credit should be \ngranted fo r the repayment of RDPs by RDPs:   \n(1) Applying the Bank’s Methodology, none of them w as repaid by RDP because \nthe result of applying that methodology leads to the Bank identifying, RDPs \nas having funded Unreturned Prepayments.  \n(2) However, a significant amount of Relevant Drawdown Portions can be seen to have been ultimately repaid by Relevant D rawdown Portions when Mr \nDavidson applies his “Exact Matching” analysis and D1 claims credit for the amount of USD 312m. \n481. Mr Thompson claims that Mr Davidson’s approach leads to double -counting.\n450 \n \n450  Thompson3/2.5 {D1/440/7}  \nAA3/1/144\n \n139  482. In its Opening Submissions,451 the Bank complains that Mr Davidson is mixing \nmethodologies. It is said that “ he uses the Bank’s methodology to analyse use of the \nRelevant Drawdowns to identify the “Relevant Drawdown Portions” and then \ndiscards that in favour of a “Funds Flow” approach in order to conduct another \nanaly sis of the same monies, leading him to the manifestly erroneous position that \nthe same monies were used in two different ways.”  \n483. It is misleading to suggest that Mr Davidson applies two methodologies. He does \nnot apply the Bank’s Methodology at all. The Bank itself has applied that in order \nto identify the RDPs which are the advances of funds that are claimed to have been \nmisappropriated.  \n484. Mr Davidson has explained that there is no combination of methodologies because \neach methodology is used for a different  purpose. Once the Bank’s Methodology \nhas been used to identify the RDPs which the Bank claims caused it loss, it has served its purpose and it does not feature a t all in Mr Davidson’s analysis which \ntakes those RDPs as his fixed and certain starting point  and then determines how \nmuch of them have been repaid.\n452 \n485.

In his Third Report, Mr Davidson explains in detail why the suggestion that using Exact Matching involves double counting is incorre ct and why, on the contrary, if \nthe starting point is the RDPs, any failure to allow credit for RDPs which repay RDPs would lead to over -stating the loss suffered by the Bank.\n453 \n \n451  BankOpening/555(5) {AA2/1/217}  \n452  Davidson3/2.29- 2.30 { D2/20/23}  \n453  Davidson3/3.19 {D2/20/37}  \nAA3/1/145\n \n140  M7. THE ALTERNATIVE USE OF FUNDS DEFENCE  \n487. If the Court determines that the repayment  of Relevant Loans by Intermediary or \nNew Loans stands to be ignored as a matter of Ukrainian law, then the question \narises whether it is relevant when assessing the loss caused to the Bank to take into \naccount the use to which the Relevant Drawdowns were put.  \n488. D1 contends that if the Repayment Defence fails in relation to repayments by other lending then credit should be given to the extent that Relevant Drawdowns (or \nRelevant Drawdown Portions depending on the starting point) were used to extinguish losses  which the Bank would otherwise inevitably have sustained. This \nis referred to as the “Use of Funds Defence ” and it is advanced in the alternative \nto the Repayment Defence.   \n489. This Defence only succeeds  if it is considered appropriate to use Mr Davidson’s \nmethodologies rather than the Bank’s Methodology to determine how the Relevant \nDrawdowns were used.\n 454   \n490. The Bank’s Methodology links Relevant Drawdowns to Unreturned Prepayments \nby reference to narrative descriptions in Transactional Data. Accordingly,  where \nthere is a prepayment but no return of prepayment, Mr Thompson’s analysis stops.  \nThat is because his methodology was designed to show that Relevant Drawdowns \nfunded Unreturned Prepayments.  \n491. Mr Davidson’s Tracing Exercise which uses the Alternative Method ology (Exact \nMatching) and the Bridging Loan Methodology – described below – has identified \na number of Transaction Chains which commence with a Relevant Drawdown455 \nand, as far as the flow of funds can be followed, end with a payment to the Bank.  \n \n454  Reply/35.3.5 { A1/25/67}  \n455  Mr Davidson has conducted the same analysis tracing Relevant Drawdown Portions,  rather than \nRelevant Drawdowns: FAJS2/3.1.2 { D4/2/ 9}    \nAA3/1/146\n \n141  492. Mr Davidson’s Use of Funds Transaction Chain Workbooks can be found at \nAppendix  8 to his First Report and include various pictograms illustrating the flow \nof funds.456 \n493. The difference between the results of applying the  Bank’s Methodology and Exact \nMatching can be seen  by the following example of two Relevant Drawdowns to \nDorteks457 traced by both experts to an Unreturned Prepayment made by Dorteks \nto Collyer.  \n494. The result of Supply Agreement tracing and Exact Matching is the same to that \npoint. However, whereas Mr Thompson’s analysis stops there (because Collyer \nnever returned the prepayment to Dorteks), Mr Davidson’s continues because Exact \nMatching shows that , having received USD 33 million, Collyer then transferred \nUSD 5 million and USD 28 million to Gardera and Amadora s who then used it to \nrepay UAH loans.  \n(1) Mr Thompson’s analysis :458 \n \n("}

It is important to emphasise that the experts agree that both analyses are supported \nby the Transactional Data. The difference in their conclusions is purely a matter of \ndeciding which methodology should be used. \n496. As to the choice of methodology to be applied to determine how the Relevant Drawdowns were used: \n(1) Mr Thompson’s position is that it is  not appropriate for him, as a forensic \naccountant, to express a view.460  \n(2) Mr Davidson on the other hand, as an experienced user of funds -flow analyses \nand tracing exercises, takes the view that , if the purpose of applying a \nmethodology is to determine what money was actually used for, then a \nconventional funds flow analysis is preferable to the Bank’s approach of \nlinking transactions by narrative descriptions appearing in the Transactional \nData.461 Mr Davidson’s  opinion is that  the method he applies  “is an objective \nprocess, with established rules, and has the advantage of working blind from transactional data, unaffected by the results one wants to achieve.”\n462 \nM7(1)  The Bridging Loan Methodology \n497. As Mr Davidson explains: \n \n460  FAJS1/3.2.1 {D4/1/5 } \n461  Davidson2/2.28 { D2/11/17}; Davidson3/2.28 { D2/20/22} \n462  Davidson2/2.31 { D2/11/17} \nAA3/1/148\n \n143  “A common feature of a Funds Flow tracing exercise is that the funds one starts with, \nand is following, will meet and co-mingle with other funds. This may be because \nthere were other funds already in the bank accounts into which the original funds \nwere received (i.e., opening account balances) and/or because the original funds \nbeing followed became mixed with other funds  subsequently paid into the same bank \naccount. Where funds from different sources are combined in one account in these \nways, it is often not possible to differentiate the original funds being traced from the  \nother funds in the account when subsequent payme nts from the account are \nconsidered.”  \n498. As part of Mr Davidson’s Tracing Exercise, Mr Davidson identified what he calls \n“Bridging Loans ” and deploys what he calls the “ Bridging Loan Methodology ”463 \nto trace payments than would be possible using only Exact Matc hing.464 \n499. The Bridging Methodology departs from a strict process of “ Exact Matching” and \ninvolves taking a wider view of the Transactional Data and the identification of \nwhat appears to be a consistent pattern of transactions which suggest that a Relevant \nDrawdown facilitated the making of a prepayment to a supplier which in turn \nallowed a loan repayment to be made to the Bank.465  \n500. Mr Thompson considers that the Bridging Loan Methodology is inconsistent with \na funds flow analysis,466 but, consistent with his posit ion that it is not for him to say \nwhich method(s) should be used, he does not suggest  that using it is wrong . \nM7(2)  The Calculations  \n501.

The NBU had a list of approved valuers, and would only accept valuations from \nvaluation firms on that list.  The NBU considered that necessary “given pervasive \nproblems in Ukraine at the time with fraudulent valuations of property ”.1  \n2. It appears the NBU also scrutinised the terms on which valuers were to be engaged.  \nIn particular, the NBU required that valuation reports be provided on terms which permitted it to rely upon them.\n2  \n3. The NBU’s risk management department als o carried out its own assessment of the \nOSFs, on the basis of which the NBU apparently formed the independent view that \nthe OSFs had been overvalued by Baker Tilly.3  \n4. A letter from the NBU to Mr Dubilet, sent on 2  July 2016, referred to the “ selective \ncheck” of the OSFs carried out by the NBU, and required the Bank to (1) provide \nadditional guarantees for the enforcement of the measures set out in the \nRestructuring Plan; and (2) submit a further list of assets valued at market value for \nthe purposes of the Asset Transfer.4  \n5. A further letter followed on 5 July 2016 from the NBU’s Credit Support \nDepartment, which among other things required the Bank to conclude valuation \nservices agreements in relation to the all assets pledged to the Bank .5  \n6.

Following that meeting, on 10 July 2016, D1 responded to the NBU’s 2 July letter, \nproviding the requested guarantees and list of assets, and also acknowledging that \nthe Bank “ had not produced valuations of security [pledged assets] complying with \nthe requirements in force .” {E14/322/1}  \n8. It appears that one of the “ requirements ” to which D1’s letter adverted was that it \nshould be made explicit that valuations of Transferred Assets were being provided for the benefit of the NBU.   \n Tripartite Valuation Agreements  \n9. On 2 5 July 2016 a valuation services agreement was made between the Bank, the \nNBU and Veritas Property Management, a Ukrainian Valuation Firm (the “ Veritas \nTripartite Agreement ”).\n7 Notably:  \n(1) The NBU is defined as the “ Customer ”, while the Bank is merely the “Payer ”.  \n(2) The NBU was to have the right to “ check (verify) and/or approve the draft \nProperty Appraisal Report ”:  \n“The Customer shall check (verify) and/or approve the draft Property Appraisal \nReport within 5 (five) business days upon receiving it from the Appraiser, or within \nanother period agreed upon by the Customer and the Appraiser. In case if the \nCustomer finds any deviations from or the Appraiser ’s failures to comply with the \nrequirements set forth in the regulatory, directive and methodological documents governing the apprai sal of property, the Customer shall send the reasoned \ncomments to the Appraiser on the draft Property Appraisal Report or individual \nprovisions thereof within the same period. If the Customer ’s comments are \njustified, the Appraiser shall make the appropriate amendments to the draft \nProperty Appraisal Report within 5 (five) business days upon the receipt thereof \nfrom the Customer, or within another period agreed upon by the Customer and the \nAppraiser ”.  Clause 2.1.3  {E15/25.2/2 } \n10. The NBU was to receive a copy  of the draft and final Property Apprais al Report \ndirectly from Veritas: Clauses 2.1.2, 2.1.4 {E15/25.2/2} \n \n7  ‘Property market Value Independent Appraisal Services Agreement No VPM 2016/174’, dated 25 \nJuly 20 16{E15/25.2/1}  \nAA3/1/159\n \niii  11. Pursuant to the Veritas Tripartite Agreement, Veritas produced valuation reports of \nvarious of the Transferred Assets, including the Petrol Stations and certain Real \nEstate assets.   \n12. While no similar tripartite agreements have been identified in the disclosure relating to the other valuation firms who produced valuations of the Transferred Assets in \nthe period following the adoption of the Restructuring Plan (e .g. Baker Tilly, UCE, \nCBRE), other contemporaneous documents suggest that tripartite agreements were entered into with valuers other than Veritas,\n8 and it should be inferred that such \narrangements were in place.9 \n NBU verification of values  \n13. While it is clear that the NBU did indeed “ validate ” the 2016 Valuation Reports, \nthere is a striking lack of contemporaneous evidence of precisely what was done as \na result of the NBU producing witnesses rather than documents. The parties’ \nvaluation experts have not seen any NBU documents containing analyses, reviews \nor reappraisals of the assets conducted by the NBU.10 Nor is the matter addressed \ncomprehensively in the evidence of the NBU witnesses called by the Bank.   \n14. Nevertheless, it is clear that – in addition to short -listing the firms from whom it \nwould accept a valuation report – the NBU was able to and did undertake its own \nprocess of verifying the values attributed to the Transferred Assets . \n15.

Ms Rozhkova  has explained that the NBU had an internal risk management \ndepartment which reviewed valuation reports and, at least in some instances, undertook its own independent investigations (including physical inspections of \nassets). As noted above, this was the c ase in relation to valuation reports provided \nby Baker Tilly in respect of certain OSFs in May 2016.\n11  \n \n8  E.g., the EY Report, discussed below, { E16/179/13}; and the NBU ’s instruction in its 5 July letter \nthat the Bank should conclude valuations service agreements for all assets pledged to the NBU : see \nabove at Appendix B  paragraph 5.  \n9  Save for Baker Tilly ’s OSF valuation report, referred to above.  \n10  AT CJ S /6.1 {D22/1/10}  \n11  Rozhkova 1/169- 173 {B1/5/42 -43} \nAA3/1/160\n \niv  16. Confirmation that such a process was applied to the subsequent valuation reports \nappears in a report (the “ EY Report ”) dated 22  November 2016 prepared by EY \nUkraine ,12 which  was engaged by the Bank  and the NBU on 16 October 2016 to \n“audit the Bank’s business and finances…for the sole purpose of management \ndecision -making.”13 The EY Report referred to the NBU “ verifying ”14 the \nvaluations provided to it by independent valuers pursuant to tripartite valuation \nservices agreements.15  \n17. Further, there is evidence that the NBU saw itself as having approved the valuations \nof Transferred Assets: Denys Novikov (of the NBU) in an email to Mr Yatsenko \n(of the Ban k) on 8 August 2016 requested additional information regarding the \nassets a ccepted onto the Bank's balance ahead of a meeting with the IMF, being \n\"the properties we have already assessed \" (inter alia , 41 OSFs, 297 petrol stations, \nZirka Bukovelyu, Dnipro S tadium).16  \n18. Although the overall valuation of the Transferred Assets validated by the NBU was \nvery close to the Original Valuation, in some cases the values “ validated” by the \nNBU were materially different. This confirms that the “ verification ” or “validati on” \nprocess amounted to more than rubber -stamping of the Original Valuations. A table \nin the EY Report17  showed the “ Value at Initial Recognition”  (i.e. the Original \nValuations) and the value according to “ NBU validation”  for the classes of \nTransferred Assets that were subject to NBU validation:  \n \n12  EY Report dat ed 22 November 2016 { E16/179/1}  \n13  EY Report dated 22 November 2016 { E16/179/2}  \n14  EY Report dated 22 November 2016 { E16/179/130}  \n15  EY Report dated 22 November 2016 { E16/179/13}  \n16  Email from Denys Novikov to Mr Yatsenko dated 8 August 2016 {E15/86/1}  \n17  EY Report dated 22 November 2016 {E16/179/40}  \nAA3/1/161\n \nv   \nAA3/1/162\n \ni  APPENDIX  C: EXTRACTS FROM THE BANK’S AUDITED FINANCIAL \nSTATEMENTS 2014 -2015 \n \nPage/ {Reference } Text of Relev ant Paragraph  \n2014 Financial Statements  \nP. 32 { K1/4/36 } “Disclosed in oil trading industry are UAH \n40,603 million or 22% of gross loans and \nadvances (2013: UAH 42,510 million or 26%) \nissued to companies engaged in wholesale and \nretail sale of petrol, oil and oil products.

The Bank is or has been party to various proceedings in Ukraine in which it has \nadopted a position or taken a step which is inconsistent with is position before this \nCourt that the Loans are void.   \nProceedings  relating to Relevant Loans \n2. On 22 August 2018, the Bank commenced proceedings in the Commercial Court \nfor the Dnipropetrovsk Region seeking to accelerate the date for repayment of the \nTamersa Loan.  That Court upheld the Bank’s claim on 8 January 2019 and declared \nthat the sum of USD 24,063,107.03 (UAH 627,353,209.73) including accrued \ninterest and penalties for late payment was then due.1\nProceedings relating to Mortgage Agreements  \n3. In a number of Ukrainian cases brought since issuing these proceedings, the Bank \nhas maintained that it was entitled to exercise its rights under Mortgage Agreements  \nwhich it claims in these proceedings are void and of no effect.2\n4. The AEF case (Alyoshin3, Section D {C9.1/1/22}) concerned the Bank’s attempt\nin August 2017 to foreclose a nd gain possession of Hotel Mir under a Mortgage\nAgreement  made  with  Ardena  LLC  which  had  been  concluded  to  secure  a\nRelevant Loan owed to the Bank by AEF LLC, a Ukrainian Borrower. When the\nvalidity of the Mortgage Agreement was challenged by AEF and Artis LLC (and\nresisted  by  the  Bank),  the  Appellate  Court  concluded  that  there  were  no  facts\nwhich would\nrender the underlying AEF loan agre ement void as a matter of public policy.3\n5.\n In the Oceanmash  case,  the Bank successfully challenged the allegation that it had \nacted unlawfully in  foreclosing on real estate assets mortgaged by Oceanmash to \nsecure Relevant Loans owed by Karinda LLC (i.e., Transferred Assets), contending \nthat its actions to enforce the mortgage were lawful and in good faith, and without \n1 D1 Defence/77(3)(f)  {A1/8/44 }\nD1 Defence/87F  {A1/8/52}\nAlyoshin3/40  {C9.1/1/23}2 \n3 \ni \nAA3/1/169\n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \nany suggestion that it regarded either the Relevant Loan or Mortgage Agreement as \nvoid.4\n6. Similarly, in the Golden Proceedings (the details of which appear at Alyoshin3,\nSection B {C9.1/1/5}) brought by Golden in January 2022, the Bank successfully\nchallenged the allegation that it had acted unlawfully in foreclosing in September\n2016 on Hotel Zirka, which had been mortgaged to secure Relevant Loans owed\nby  three  Ukrainian  Borrowers.  Golden  LLC  specifically  relied  on  the  Bank’s\nallegations in the present proceedings that the agreements were void but the Bank\nmaintained  that  until  the  English  Court  invalided  the  agreements  they  were\npresumed  to  be  valid  and  that  in  any  event  the  Mortgage  Agreement  remained\nvalid  because  it  had  secured  other  loans  which  the  Bank  had  not  claimed  were\ninvalid. The Court determined5 that there was no basis upon which it could treat the loans\nas invalid and accordingly the Bank’s actions had been lawful.6\nProceedi ngs relating to New Lo"}

The Court determined5 that there was no basis upon which it could treat the loans\nas invalid and accordingly the Bank’s actions had been lawful.6\nProceedi ngs relating to New Loans \n7. Further,  i n  2017,  the  Bank  sought  unsuccessfully  to  terminate  New  Loans,  and\nsubsequently defended proceedings initiated by New Borrowers, in particular Like\nCity  and  Business  Prom  Innovatsiya  challenging  the  validity  of  the  Bank’s\ntermination notices.7 Details of the proc eedings are set out in Alyoshin3/10-14\n{C9.1/1/8-10}.\n8. By seeking to terminate those New Loans on purported grounds which had nothing \nto do with the matters now relied upon by the Bank to impugn the val idity of the \nLoans, the Bank implicitly affirmed that the New Loans in question were valid.  \n9.\n The same was affirmed explicitly  by Ukrainian courts seized in those cases: in both \nthe Like City  and the Business Prom Innovatsiya  cases, the court concluded:  \n4 Alyoshin3/72-76 {C9.1/1/33-35}; D1 Defence/87F {A1/8/52}\nWestern Appellate Court decision of 12 December 2022\nD1 Defence/87F(2) {A1/8/52}\nProceedings were initiated by other New Borrowers, namely BusinessProm Invest and Borand, but\nthe judgments in those cases [had] not become effective as of the date of Alyoshin3: see Alyoshin3/\n17 {C9.1/1/15}5 \n6 \n7 \nii \n AA3/1/170\n \n  (1) That the relevant loan agreement had been and remained valid and lawful; \nand \n(2) That funds advanced under the relevant loan agreement had been used to \nrepay, and discharge, obligations of a number of Borrowers under loans \nwhich included Relevant Loans.  \nSee, in relation to Like City: Alyoshin3/15.1 {C9.1/1/10-11} ; and in relation\nto Business Prom Innovatsiya: Alyos hin3/15.2 {C9.1/1/11-12}.10.\n \niii \n AA3/1/171\n \ni \n APPENDIX F:  MEMBERS OF MANAGEMENT BOARD AND ECC \n  \nI.
