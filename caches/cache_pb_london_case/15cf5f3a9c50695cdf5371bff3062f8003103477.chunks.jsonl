Mr Bogolyubov  is a businessman  and investor  with interests in a diverse range of industries. \nHe was born in Ukraine  and began his business activities there in the 1990s following the \nliberalisation of the economy .1 However, in 2009 he moved to London and he continued to \nlive outside o f Ukraine until 2019, such that at all times material to the Bank’s claim he was \nresident abroad.2 \n2. Prior to its nationalisation  in 2016, Mr Bogolyubov  was the joint owner of the Bank with \nMr Kolomoisky  and other minority shareholders , having co -founded it with others in 1992.  \nMr Bogolyubov was a member of the Bank’s non- executive Supervisory Board, but this was \nonly one of a number of such roles that he held.3 Similarly, the Bank was only one of a \nnumber of major enterprises in which Mr Bogolyubov had an interest . From the early 2000s \nMr Bogolyubov began to pursue business opportunities outside of Ukraine, including \nmaking significant investments in mining vent ures in Australia and Ghana.4 Although the \nBank was listed as an interest throughout the period, the documentary record reveals that \nMr Bogolyubov took a  relatively  passive interest in the affairs of the Bank  up to 1 .7.14 and \nafter that acted only in acco rdance with his Deed s of Indemnity and Waiver  with Mr \nKolomoisky.  Although the Bank has put Mr Bogolyubov to proof of these agreement s it is \nclear from the metadata in the documents recording  and transmitting  execution versions of  \nthe agreement s that they are authentic and may be taken at face value.  \nA2. THE CASE AGAINST MR BOGOLYUBOV  \n3. The Bank’s case is that Mr Bogolyubov misappropriated money from the Bank through a \n“Scheme”  or “Misappropriation” comprising the Relevant Loans, Relevant Drawdowns and \nUnreturned Prepayments.5 However, the Bank fails  to recognise the significance of the total \n \n1  See, for example,  Mr Bogolyubov’s CV dated June 2013 {E18/235.2/1} . \n2  This is common ground: Bank Opening/60  {AA2/1/30 -31} \n3  In particular, Mr Bogolyubov was also a member of the Supervisory Board of JSC Ukrnafta, Ukraine’s larg est \noil producer, and of JSC Ukrtatnafta, a major oil refinery { E18/235.2/1} . \n4  Id. \n5  For convenience, Mr Bogolyubov r efers to the Bank’s allegations as the “Scheme”  without any admission that \nthis is an accurate description of the relevant events. Similarly, references to the “Misappropriation” are \nwithout prejudice to Mr Bogolyubov’s case that no funds were in fact m"}

Similarly, references to the “Misappropriation” are \nwithout prejudice to Mr Bogolyubov’s case that no funds were in fact misappropriated from the Bank.  \nAA4/1/5\n \n2 \n absence of any direct evidence against Mr Bogolyubov implicating him in any involvement \nwith the “Scheme” .  \n4. There is no evidence that Mr Bogolyubov knew of the “Sc heme”  or Misappropriation, still \nless that he directed or authorised the Relevant Loans or the Relevant Drawdowns or the \nUnreturned Prepayments. The Bank contends that it is implausible that the “Scheme”  could \nhave proceeded without his direct knowledge an d approval, however it is equally implausible \nthat Mr Bogolyubov knew  of and approved the “Scheme”  without that being recorded by \nany one of the many participants in the “Scheme” , whether in the causal S kype chats or the \nother  records of communications wit h or about Mr Bogolyubov  at the relevant  time . \n5. The absence of any material of this sort  is the evidence that Mr Bogolyubov was not \ninvolved. It is for the Bank to provide a plausible explanation for this evidential void .6 \nReliance on inference to fill this void  is not appropriate. It is not possible to draw a \nsufficiently reliable inference  from Mr Bogolyubov ’s ownership interests, his position on the \nSupervisory Board of the Bank, his provision of assets to support the Bank  or his \nrelationship with Mr Kolomoisky  and others.  Still less is it appropriate to draw inferences \nfrom Mr Bogolyubov’s conduct of this litigation.  \n6. Mr Bogolyubov’s limited , indirect  (and in many cases fleeting) ownership interests in  \nrelevant entities  (such as some of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers)  do not give \nrise to any legitimate adverse inference in the absence of evidence that Mr Bogolyubov was \nable, in practice, to control these entities or direct their activities or, critically, that he d id so \nat the relevant time. There is simply no evidence of this. The underlying asset structures \nwhich led to the obscur ity of his  ownership interests that feature so heavily in the Bank’s \nopening are not temporally related to the fraud. The  structures and the entities servicing \nthem were  in existence for many years before 2013 and are recorded in asset structure charts \nfrom 2007/2008, well before the Bank suggests  any “Scheme”  began . His ownership \ninterests  (such as there were)  appear to have been accident al and historic rather than present \nand deliberate, given the obvious concern of those operating the “Scheme”  to avoid the \nappearance of related party lending.   \n7. Mr Bogolyubov’s position on the Supervisory Board and as a significant shareholder in the \nBank is also inadequate to give rise to a reliable and sufficient inference. The Bank accepts \nthat the Relevant Loans were not referred to or approved by the Supervis ory Board, and \n \n6  Contrast Bank Ope ning/ 6(2) where the Bank reverses  the burden of proof   {AA2/1/13 }. \nAA4/1/6\n \n3 \n does not suggest that other aspects of the “Scheme”  or Misappropriation were reported to \nit. Any “Scheme”  plainly  operated in a manner that was clandestine and contrary to all \nprinciples of prudent banking . The highest the case can be put is  that any “Scheme”  or \nMisappropriation must have been approved at a high level in the Bank. However, Mr \nBogolyubov is not the most likely candidate for that role. The Bank claims that the \n“Scheme”  was operated by , amongst others , Mr Dubilet . It was Mr Dubi let who signed the \nmajority of the “Scheme” loan approvals. There is no evidence that “Scheme” loans were \nkept from the Supervisory Boa"}

It was Mr Dubi let who signed the \nmajority of the “Scheme” loan approvals. There is no evidence that “Scheme” loans were \nkept from the Supervisory Board to keep Mr Bogolyubov’s “fingerprints” off the loan \napproval documents. None  of the Bank’s general  related party lendi ng7 (including  the \n“Scheme”  loans ) appears to have been submitted for  approval to the Supervisory Board . Mr \nDubilet’s conduct in avoiding the Supervisory Board and his  breach of the Bank ’s Credit \nCommittees Regulation8 is evidence in favour of the  innocence of the  Supervisory Board , \nnot against it.9  \n8. The fact that Mr Bogolyubov was willing to agree to his assets being pledged does not provide any evidence of his  knowledge of the “Scheme” . The parlous state of the Ukrainian \nbanking sector was a matter of public record as were the concerns of the IMF and the NBU.  \nAs the Bank acknowledges there was a liquidity crisis in the Bank following the  February \n2014 Revolution of Dignity that led to re quests for NBU  support in July 2014.  It can be \ninferred that t he frequent contact  during this period between Mr Dubilet and Mr \nBogolyubov  relied on by the Bank\n10 most obviously relates to discussion about these acute \nmacro -economic  problems (and/or general  banking/personal business)  rather than \nevidencing Mr Bogolyubov’s involvement in the “Scheme” .  \n9. The support provided by Mr Bogolyubov to the Bank  also undermines the proposition that \nhe benefitted from any Misappropriation. There is no evidence that Mr Bogolyubov did so.  \n10. The Bank persistently attributes to Mr Bogolyubov  conduct by  other individuals (including  \nMr Kolomoisky ) it alleges were involve d in the scheme that is not shown to be known to \nMr Bogolyubov or authorised by him. The only reliable inference that can be drawn from \n \n7  The only example D2 has identified of the Supervisory Board approving lending during the relevant period \nwas of the issuance of subordinated debt to one of the Bank’s subsidiaries, MoskomPrivatBank { K1/31}  \n8   {C1/219/1}  \n9  Bank Opening/ 202 specifically refers to lending in July 2014 to Dorteks and Uniks as “ keeping D1 -2's fingerprints \noff the loan approval documents ” {AA2/1/93 } but the Bank ignores the fact that none  of the relevant lending (and \nessentially no  lending at all from 2010 onwards ) was referred to the Supervisory Board.  \n10  Bank Opening /119  {AA2/1/56 -57} \nAA4/1/7\n \n4 \n the history of Mr Bogolyubov ’s dealings with the Bank and his assets between 2010 and \n2016 is that Mr Bogolyubov appears to h ave authorised others to deal with assets on his \nbehalf and without reference to him (including Mr Kolomoisky in relation to assets in \nUkraine, including the Bank, in which they both had interests) . Even if any wrongdoing were \nestablished, t his form of sta nding approval would be insufficient to give rise to any liability \nfor Mr Bogolyubov  under Ukrainian law. Further , it is clear that from  at least  1.7.14 Mr \nBogolyubov ’s role in the Bank was purely nominal .  \n11. The Bank also seeks to rely on the continuing rel ationships between Mr Bogolyubov and \nothers  post-2016. This is not legitimate.  The relationships are all longstanding and pre -date \nthe “Scheme” . Even if it were commercially viable  to separate his assets and establish free \nstanding business es of his own, s ince 2016 Mr Bogolyubov has been demonstrably  restricted \nin his ability to unilaterally rearrange his business affairs  without the co -operation of others .  \n12.

It is also not right to rely against Mr Bogolyubov on Mr Kolomoisky ’s litigation conduct \npost-2016. There is no proper  basis on which forensic decision s taken on behalf of  Mr \nBogolyubov  (for example to adopt the litigation position of Mr Kolomoisky or to defer to \nMr Kolomoisky in a disclosure exercise) should stand as evidence against him . The \nproposition that the production and deployment of the Lafferty S preadsheets can be \nassumed to involve  Mr Bogolyubov as a knowing participant is  also wrong . The Bank’s \nstance  fails to recognise the reality of hard -fought litigat ion, particularly in a context where \nMr Bogolyubov holds the Deeds of Indemnity and Waiver . The Bank’s comments on \ndocument “destruction” or non- disclosure and on the availability of witnesses will be dealt \nwith elsewhere given the level of detail required  in response . However,  it suffices to say that \nthe allegations of breaches of litigation holds and deliberate destruction of documents  are \nunjustified. The relevant disclosure date ranges in th e Tatneft and Pinchuk litigation ended \nin 201311 and there is no evidence that Mr Bogolyubov deliberately destroyed documents in \nanticipation of litigation . \n13. The Bank’s case is no more than an assumption that Mr Bogolyubov must have been involved when his c onduct is viewed through English eyes and the prism of English \ncommercial principles and practices. This is not a legitimate way in which to judge this \nUkrainian case. The Court should consider the evidence, not merely to determine what probably happened but also to decide what inferences can safely be drawn in the Ukrainian \n \n11  {A4/32/4}  \nAA4/1/8\n \n5 \n context. When that is done, it appears more probable than not that the actions said to \ncomprise the “Scheme” , most importantly the issuance of the Relevant Loans,  operated \nwithout refer ence to Mr Bogolyubov . \n14. Moreover, the Court should be alive to the fact that while the Bank frequently refers to its \nclaim as one for ‘ Misappropriation’, there is no such cause of action in Ukrainian civil law, nor \nany generalised doctrine of civil fraud. Rather, Ukrainian law provides for civil liability only in specified situations , not made out on the Bank’s case . Further,  whilst the Bank complains \nabout “implausible” Ukrainian  law points, it provide s no answer to the  repayment defence \nand in part icular the  analysis of Bryan J in National Bank Trust v Yurov  [2020] EWHC 100 \n(Comm) at [1194] {M1/22 /370}  (accepted by its own expert  as reflecting Ukrainian law ) \nthat when wrongfully obtained money is used to repay a loan , any loss caused by the original  \nloan is extinguished. The loss caused by the fraud is not the or iginal lending  but that caused \nby the later wrongful act .  \nA3. T\nHE BANK’S CASE IS NOT SUSTAINABLE  \n15. An examination of the evidence rather than the Bank’s assumptions is also necessary in connection with the Bank’s Mis appropriation case. The evidence shows that the acts relied \nupon as comprising the  “Misappropriation” fell in the middle of a pattern of lending over a \nmuch longer period that was wholly controlled by the Bank. The motive that lay behind this \npattern of behaviour has not been established in evidence.  \n16. The existence of this pattern of borrowing must give rise to a working  assumption that it \nserved some purpose  such as covering earlier losses . Such an assumption would  \nfundamentally undermine  the Bank’s case that any losses it suffered were caused by the \nRelevant Loans or Relevant Drawdowns, b oth as a matter of law and logic .

The existence of this pattern of borrowing must give rise to a working  assumption that it \nserved some purpose  such as covering earlier losses . Such an assumption would  \nfundamentally undermine  the Bank’s case that any losses it suffered were caused by the \nRelevant Loans or Relevant Drawdowns, b oth as a matter of law and logic . If the pattern of \nborrowing caused a ny losses , such  losses were caused either before or after the Relevant \nLoans , Relevant Drawdowns and Unreturned Prepayments.  \n17. The accounting evidence and the contemporaneous documents show that funds comprising \nthe Relevant Drawdowns did not ultimately go to fund the so -called Unreturned \nPrepayments , but fell within this pattern of borrowing . For the most part, t he Relevant  \nDrawdowns were used by the Bank to repay previous borrowings befor e in turn  being \nrepaid by later borrowing. No M isappropriation is evident in this process : the sums remained \nunder the control of the Bank so that those controlling the transactions were able to \ncontinue to circulate loans into 2016. The key link between Relevant Drawdowns and \nAA4/1/9\n \n6 \n Unreturned Prepayments, relied upon by the Bank as the way in which funds were allegedly \nsiphoned out of the Bank, is therefore broken. Far from the “music” stopping with the Unreturned Prepayments in September 2014, it played on in the form of continued circular \nlending.  \n18. As to how the funds from the Relevant Drawdowns were used, the authenticity of the \ntransaction data containing references to the Relevant Supply Agreements ( RSAs ) is not a \nbaseless or meaningless distraction. An enquiry as to the authenticity of data is justified in \ncircumstances where at least some of the RSAs and loan applications (together with the relevant corporate authori sations ) did not exist at the point when the data purports to record \na loan drawdown/prepayment by reference to an RSA. The Bank accepts that “ one must look \nto the contemporaneous evidence as to the “ overall purpose and effect ” of the interconnected transactions ,” \nrather than conduct “ the purpose of which is to hide the true p icture”.\n12 Mr Bogolyubov will argue \nthat the use of the supply agreement references in the data was indeed designed to hide the \ntrue picture. The true purpose of the “Unreturned” Prepayments was not to pay for a non-\nexistent RSA but instead to ensure the immediate r eturn of the money to the Bank in a so \ncalled “ technical disbursement ”.  \n19. The claim that there were RSAs, Prepayments and that they were capable of being treated \nas Unreturned in the records of the Bank may have been  no more than an attempt by Bank \nemployee s to avoid criticism or punishment for breaches of the foreign exchange rules by \nthe Bank. These attempts  to avoid restrictions on the Bank  did not cease with the \n“Unreturned” Prepayments in the autumn  of 2014; they simply continued in a different \nform.  \n20. In any event, the Unreturned Prepayments cannot  give rise to any loss. Either the Bank \nsuffered loss by reason of the  Relevant  Drawdowns which it says funded those Prepayments \nor it did not (because the loans were repaid and the funds returned to the Bank). Despite the Bank’s heav y reliance upon them, t he Unreturned Prepayments are technically  irrelevant \nto the Bank’s case .  Their use has primarily been  as a jurisdictional hook to bring these \notherwise entirely Ukrainian proceedings before the English court.  \n21. On any view, the Court will need to consider whether the Bank’s claim of \n“Misappropriation” justifies the legal and accounting exceptio nalism that the Bank’s case \nrequire s, so that loans and the repayment of loans both before and after the Relevant Loans \n \n12  Bank Opening/571  {AA2/1/224 } \nAA4/1/10\n \n7 \n are treated as irrelevant, void as a matter of law, and not t"}

The PBC and \nPrimecap individual s were not t he only “ fungible ”13 entities. The corporate borrowers \nthemselves appear to have been fungible  under the control of the Bank without any \nreference to the individual  director or officers of the entit ies concerned .  \n22. The documents also establish that, both be fore and after December 2016, the Bank, its \nauditors, accountants and the NBU appointed inspectors and curators accepted that there \nhad been valid repayments of all bar two  of the Relevant Loans. There are no legitimate \ngrounds for disregarding the books a nd records of the Bank and these repayments. Even if \nthe funds for the repayments were improperly obtained (which Mr Bogolyubov does not \nadmit) , any losses caused by the Relevant Loans were extinguished in fact and in law. Any \nlosses suffered by the Bank on this hypothesis were caused by subsequent conduct  and \nevents , in respect of which the Bank has not brought any claim .  \nA4. STRUCTURE  OF THESE OPE NINGS  \n23. These openings are structured as follows:  \n23.1 Section B  explains  the contrived nature of the Bank’s case and how it is \nunsustainable in the face of the evidence as to what was going on at the Bank.   \n23.2 Section C  addresses the evidential void in relation to Mr Bogolyubov’s involvement \nin any “Scheme” .  \n23.3 Section D  sets out the accounting position in relation to the loss alleged to have \nbeen suffered by the Bank.  \n23.4 Section E  covers the key issues of Ukrainian law.  \n24. Four schedules are appended to these openings : \n24.1 Schedule 1 – Sample Borrower Chronology : this provides an illustrative example \nof how one Borrower, Uniks, was treated by the Bank over the relevant period, \nshowing how the Relevant Loan was issued, how the Bank employees used supply \n \n13  See Bank Opening/ 196(2)  {AA2/1/87 } \nAA4/1/11\n \n8 \n agreements and prepaym ents, how the funds  from the Relevant Drawdowns  were \nintended by the employees to be used, and how the borrowing was repaid.  \n24.2 Schedule 2 – Contemporaneous Evidence Showing Use of Relevant \nDrawdown Funds : this provides illustrative examples of the use of Rel evant \nDrawdowns as demonstrated by the documentary evidence.  \n24.3 Schedule 3 – Firefighting (Part 1) Ukrainian Currency Controls : this sheds light \non how Bank employees were responding over the relevant period  to NBU foreign \ncurrency controls  and how certain aspects of the “Scheme”  in fact fell within this \nwider behaviour . \n24.4 Schedule 4 – Firefighting (Part 2) Ukrainian Related Party Lending Controls : \nthis sheds light on how  Bank employees were responding over the relevant period \nto NBU restricti ons on related party lending  and how certain aspects of the \n“Scheme”  in fact fell within this wider behaviour . \n25. The Court is not asked to pre -read the Schedules : these are for reference,  and it is hoped \nthat they may assist the Court during cross -examinatio n. D2 notes that the Bank has \nproduced some schedules on similar topics (related party lending14 and chronologies of some \nRSAs15): these are selective and do not present a full picture.

The Bank has been given permission to use two additional days in oral opening to present \nits documentary case against Mr Bogolyubov.  As he will not be able to respond in evidence \n(including in re -examination)  Mr Bogolyubov will answer these points insofar as appropriate \nin closing and will include any  additional responsive documents at that stage.    \n27. The Bank has also made a number of unheralded and detailed new submissions in its \nOpening, asking for adverse inferences to be drawn against Mr Bogolyubov. In the time available, it has not been possible to respond to these submissions . A response will be \nprovided in due course.  \n \n14  Bank  Opening/ Schedule 3  {AA2/2/4} . The Court is asked to look at D2’s Schedule 4 (Related Party Lending ). \n15  Bank Opening/ Schedule 5  {AA2/2/13 }. The Court is asked to look at D2’s Schedule 1, which shows a far \nmore complete picture of an example Borrower transaction.  \nAA4/1/12\n \n9 \n B. THE  BANK’S CASE AND THE ALLEGED “SCHEME”  \n28. The Bank’s case has been crafted to found jurisdiction in England & Wales . It allege s a \n“Scheme”  or “Misappropriation”  comprising a  limited  set of transactions ( focusing in \nparticular on the Relevant Loans, Relevant  Drawdowns and Unreturne d Prepayments) , \ninvolving a limited set of parties,  and occurring over a limited  time period  (Section B1 ).  \n29. The Bank’s alleged Misappropriation does not sit comfortably with the contemporaneous \ndocuments . In particular:  \n29.1 First, the documents show that the Relevant Loans and Relevant Drawdowns  were \nnot distinctive, but  fell within a wider pattern of borrowing , involving many more \ntransactions and parties ove r a far longer time period ( Section B2 ).  \n29.2 Secondly , the existence of this pattern  of borrowing undermines the Bank ’s cas e that \nit suffered loss from the Relevant Loans or Relevant Drawdowns.16 As the forensic \naccounting evidence and contemporaneous documents show , rather than being \nsiphoned out as Unreturned Prepayments  as the Bank would suggest , the Relevant \nDrawdowns  form ed part of a chain of borrowing , at least for the most part being \nused to repay previous borrowing and in turn being repaid ( Section s D2 - D3).  \n29.3 Thirdly , there is no suggestion in t he documents that the elements of the alleged \nMisappro priation (including the  RSAs and Unreturned Prepayments ) were  part of a \nmasterminded  fraud  in which the “music” stops in September 2014 . Rather, matters \nsaid by the Bank to evidence a Misappropriation in 2014 can alternatively be \nexplained as instances of  “firefighting” by Bank employees in response to banking \nregulations  and NBU audits  (Section B3 ). The Bank  (mis)i nterpret s events through \nthe prism of the “Scheme”  rather than recognising the real -world  event s driving \nchanges within the Bank.   \n29.4 Fourthly , and consistently with this, an analysis of the Bank’s accounts over this time \nperiod does not yield any indications of  misapp ropriation ( Section B4 ).  \n29.5 Fifthly , it is clear that the hryvnia  is the  currency  in which any  loss was felt by the \nBank  and which most truly expresse s any loss, not least because the Bank was obliged \n \n16 c.f. the Bank’s case that it has suffered loss because “there has been no repayment of any of the funds transferred out of \nthe Bank’s control pursuant to the Misappropriation or of an y i"}

It sought support from the NBU in hryvnia \nand was recapitalised following it s nationalisation in hry vnia. Any counterfactual \nanalysis ends with the Bank holding hryvnia ( Section D4 ). \nB1. THE ARTIFICIAL CONSTRUCTION  OF THE BANK’S CASE \n30. The Bank’s case is based on the alleged misappropriation by Mr Kolomoisky and Mr \nBogolyubov  of c. USD 1.9bn from the Bank.  It alleges that the funds were misappropriated \nby way of  the Relevant Loans , Relevant Drawdowns and Unreturned Prepayments , as \nfollows:  \n30.1 Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov “procured and were the ultimate beneficiaries of the \nmisappropriation of $1,911,877,385 of the Bank’s funds between April 2013 and September \n2014”  (the period from issuance of the first Re levant Loan to the final Relevant \nDrawdown ): RRRRAPOC/5 { A1/2/2 }.  \n30.2 “The Misappropriation started with the transfer of funds from the Bank to the Borrowers under the \nRelevan t Drawdowns, and continued so as to include the transfer of funds from the Borrowers to the \nDefendant Suppliers pursuant to the Unreturned Prepayments .”: 22 May RRFI , ¶4 {A2/9/9} . \n30.3 “[T] he Misappropriation started with the transfer of funds from the Bank to the Borrowers under \nthe Relevant Loans , as a result of which the Bank suffered a loss.”: 22 May RRFI , ¶6 \n{A2/9/9 }.  \n30.4 The Bank’s two quantum figures  of USD 1,911,877,385 and USD  1.9bn variously \nreferred to represent “[ t]he Bank’s quantification of the minimum figure for the total principal \noutstanding in respect of the Relevant Drawdowns (taking into account the extent to which, based \non information currently available to it, the Bank accepts that the Relevant Drawdowns h ave been \nvalidly repaid); and/or [ t]he total amount of the Unreturned Prepayments (which on the Bank’s \ncase were caused by the Relevant Drawdowns).” : 5 May RRFI, ¶21 { A2/4/22} .  \n31. The Bank appears to have focused its case  on the Relevant Loans, Relevant Drawdowns \nand Unreturned Prepayments in order to create a jurisdictional anchor . As the Bank accepted \nduring  the jurisdiction proceedings, apart from the fact that D3 -5 (alleg ed recipients of \nUnreturned Prepayments)  are English  companies, the claim has no connection to England \nand Wales: {A5/10/5 } ¶22.  \nAA4/1/14\n \n11 \n 32. At the same time, the Bank has suggested in interlocutory proceedings that the alleged \nMisappropriation formed part of a larger “Scheme”  going back to as early as 2008  and \ninvolving a far larger sum of money: e.g. Lewis  1/67 -8, 97 {H1/1/16 } {H1/1/22 }, Wales  \n16/45(c) {H1/58/15- 16}. This larger  scheme does not form part of its  pleaded  claim , which \nis deliberately limited to  the US D 1.9bn it says reached the English and BVI Defendants’ \nbank accounts between May and August 2014 by way of the Unreturned Prepayments.   \n33. The Court must approach the Bank’s pleaded case in accordance with its terms. As explained \nbelow, accepting this  case would  require the Court to ignore  the reality that (i) the \ntransactions upon which the Bank  focuses fall within a wider pattern of behav iour; (ii) the \nRelevant Drawdowns in fact circled back to the Bank to repay other loans ; and (i"}

As explained \nbelow, accepting this  case would  require the Court to ignore  the reality that (i) the \ntransactions upon which the Bank  focuses fall within a wider pattern of behav iour; (ii) the \nRelevant Drawdowns in fact circled back to the Bank to repay other loans ; and (iii) as the \nBank’s o wn records show, the Relevant Drawdowns were nearly all repaid . \n34. Moreover, the Bank’s case is not even internally consistent. For example, in its attempt to \nmake the Relevant Drawdown  by the Borrower Prominmet  fit into its schema , the Bank \nforgoes its usual  accounting methodology  (which would suggest the Relevant Drawdown \nwas used for an Unreturned Prepayment to a Ukrainian Borrower, Viglon)  in favour of a \ndifferent combination of methodologies which permit s it to link the Relevant Drawdown to \nan Unreturned Prepayment to Collyer  (or perhaps more accurately to trace the Unreturned \nPrepayment to Collyer back to the Prominmet Relevant Drawdown) : Steadman  3/2.2.2-\n2.2.9 { D3/13/7 -8}.17 \nB2. THE “SCHEME ” IN REALITY : BROADER PATTERN S OF BEHAVIOUR  \n35. The transactions by which the Bank alleges USD 1.9bn  was misappropriated occurred over \na limited timesc ale of 17 months : the Relevant Loans  were issued  between 3.4.13 and \n21.8.14, the Relevant Drawdowns  made  between 1.11.13 and 1.9.14 and the Unreturned \nPrepayments  between 28.5.14 and 1.9.14. The Bank  focuses on a slightly wider set of \nbehaviour as the alleged “cover -up”, including the  Intermediary Loans  that it says  were \nissued for the purpose of  “disguising ” the Misappropriation.18 \n36. The Bank portrays  these as a distinct  set of transactions . As illustrated below, t he documents \nsuggest  to the contrary  that they forme d part of a broader pattern of behaviour. In particular :  \n \n17  Thompson 5 purports to respond to this but provides no convincing answer to the point that , if the Bank’s \nMethodology is applied  i.e. the focus is on matching supply agreement references , tracing would stop after \nProminmet’s funds are transferred to  Viglon: {D1/515}   \n18 RRRRAPOC/52(1)(vi.A) {A1/2/30 } \nAA4/1/15\n \n12 \n 36.1 Bank employees behaved in the same way whether they  were dealing with Relevant \nLoans , Intermediary Loans or other  (non- relevant)  loans; and  \n36.2 Relevant Loans, Intermediary Loans and other  (non- relevant)  loans all appear to \nhave been used by the Bank in a pattern of borrowing and loan recycling which \nstarted before the Relevant Loans and continued long after  them.   \n(1) Patterns of behaviour: issuance and approval of loans  \n37. The documents suggest that the process for requesting, approving , signing  and issuing loans \nand drawdowns was the same for Relevant Loans , Intermediary Loans  and other loans. T he \nRelevant Loans were not marked out in any special way.  \n38. Requests to open new loan facilities : Bank employees appear to have regularly requested the \nopening  of new loan facilities to replace existing loans. Their requests did not distinguish \nbetween Relevant , Intermediary or other loans or borrowers. For example,  an email of \n1.10.13 from Mr Kazantsev  (then -Deputy Head of Client Lending in BOK)  to other Bank \nemployees, subject line “ !!! New traders ”, stated:  \n“Urgently! The signed contracts are required tomorrow.  \nWe are opening USD loan facilities for USD 55 million line (+/ -)  \nSkybud LLC -35601496, T. Tishkova  \nVegatorg LLC - 35601407, E.

Approval of loans by the Credit Committee : as explained below  (Section C5(1)) , the Credit \nCommittee was responsible for approving loans . The Credit Committee Cards  (which \ncontained applications for loans or amendments to loans ) are in the same format and do not \ndistinguish between Relevant Loan s, Intermediary Loan s or other (non- relevant) loan s. \nExamples of Relevant Loan cards are at { E1/343} (Viitella, 3.6.13) { E1/344 } (Tamersa, \n4.6.13). Examples of Intermediary Loan cards are at { E1/251 } (Elsis Time, 20.2.13), \n \n19 Skybud’s Intermediary Loans were (i ) a loan of UAH 300m dated 4.9.14 and (ii) a loan of UAH 190m dated \n9.9.14.  \nAA4/1/16\n \n13 \n {E4/207}  (Vegatorg, 31.7.14), {E2/201}  (Orbela, 14.11.13). Examples of non- relevant loan \ncards are at  {E2/206.1 } (Dniproavia, 27.11.13), { E11/269.2}  (Viglon, 9.10.15) . \n40. Signature of loan documents by Mr Dubilet : as explained below  (Section C5(1)) , it was \nusually  Mr Dubilet (Chairman of the Management Board)  who signed the Relevant Loan \ndocuments. Loan documents were often sent to him in batches, with no distinction drawn \nbetween Rele vant Loans, Intermediary Loans or other  (non-relevant ) loans. Moreover, n o \nloans were identified to  him as forming  part of any “Scheme” . For example : \n40.1 On 4. 4.13, Mr Dubilet was asked to sign (i) a loan to  Laverton , a non- relevant  \nborrower ; (ii) a loan to Stimeks , an Intermediary Borrower but where the loan was \nnot an Intermediary Loan ; and (iii)  a loan  to Orbela , a Relevant Borrower, but where \nthe loan was not Relevant or Intermediary { E1/299 }. \n40.2 On 29.7.14, Mr Dubilet was asked to sign (i) a Relevant Loan to Uniks ; (ii) an \nIntermediary Loan to Intorno; and (iii)  a loan extension to Intersplav,  a non- relevant  \nborrower  {E4/189} .  \n40.3 On 5.8.14, Mr Dubilet was asked to sign two Intermediary Loans  to Vegatorg and \nUniks alongside  three addenda to loan agreements to Biotreyd, a non- relevant  \nborrower  {E4/248} . \n40.4 On 12.2.15, Mr Dubilet was asked to approve extensions to the repayment schedules \nof various loans . Some concern ed Relevant Loans (to Favore and Faboris). O thers \nconcern ed loans which were neither Relevant nor Intermediary Loans  and, with one \nexception (Elti -Treyd , an Intermediary Borrower), related to non- relevant  borrowers  \n{E7/311 }. \n41. Instructions to issue drawdowns : No distinct ions were drawn between the issuance of \nRelevant , Intermediary  and non- relevant  drawdowns . For example : \n41.1 In a Skype message of 31.3.14, Alina Suprun (Senior Specialist in Forex Transactions \nand Currency Control, BOK ) told Elena Khrustalyova (Senior Speciali st for the \nHead Office, BOK ) to “action payment  Solmbridge…&  Tekhnistreyd & Faboris ” \n{K6/37.1/ 2-4}. Solmbridge and Faboris made Relevant Drawdowns on 1 -2.4.14. \nTekhnistreyd is not a Relevant Borrower and, whilst it is an Intermediary Borrower, \nit made no Inter mediary Drawdowns at this time.  \nAA4/1/17\n \n14 \n 41.2 In a message of 13.6.14, Mr Kazantsev told  Yulia Chechel  (Senior Specialist in \nFinancing of Trading Companies, BOK ) {K6/41.12/ 3} \n“loans for today  \nInkom 14 049 900 UAH (for foreign currency loan repayment)  \nRaney a 582 ,733.15 UAH and Rapit 786 ,689.75 UAH for PF” \n41.3 The figures stated for Raneya and Rapit  match Relevant Drawdowns of 13.6.14. By \ncontrast, the figure for Inkom matches an Intermediary  Drawdown of the same date.  \n(2) Patt"}

By \ncontrast, the figure for Inkom matches an Intermediary  Drawdown of the same date.  \n(2) Patterns of behaviour: loan recycling  \n42. The documents  also demonstrate that the Relevant Loans fell within a pattern of loan \nrecycling  that started  before  and continued alongside  and after the Relevant Loans and \nRelevant Drawdowns . Relevant  Loans , Intermediary  Loans  and non- relevant l oans and \ndrawd owns were treated  side-by-side by Bank employees with no distinctions drawn \nbetween them.  Because the Bank has disclosed transaction data and related documents only \nfrom 1.1.13 it is not possible to trace back to the start of the pattern. It was evidently in full \nswing by 1.1.13.20 \n43. Examples of recycling before the Relevant Loans  were issu ed (pre-3.4.13) : \n43.1 28.1.13: A spreadsheet circulated within the Bank shows loans granted by the Bank \nto one set of companies in turn being transferred to another set of  companies for \nrepayment of  their loans and/or interest to the Bank {E1/240 } {E1/241 }. Two \nRelevant Borrowers (Tamersa and Nautis -Trade) were included in this spreadsheet \nas were three Intermediary Borrowers (Amadoras, Foks Trading, Mikuran) and three \nnon-relevant  borrowers (Oil -Prime, Yukora and Energy Rate).  \n43.2 29.1.13: Konstantin Barsuk (a PBC employee)  email ed Mr Kazantsev  (copying Sergei \nMelnik, Olena Kravchenko and Olena Pivovar21) saying that “ the funds of the companies \nlisted below are insufficient to repay interest on loan agreements ” and that funds for making \nrepayments had been ordered for a further list of companies. Some of the listed \ncompanies are Relevant Borrowers, some are Intermediary Borrowers, some \n(Sigmatreyder, Nordis Plyus and Polyaris M) are neither { E1/242} . \n \n20  The criticism of Mr Steadman's analysis of Relevant Customers (Bank Opening /573-574)  {AA2/1/225}  is \nunjustified. His analysis is necessarily limited to the data disclosed by the Bank.  \n21  Mr Melnik was a PBC employee. It is the Bank’s case that Ms Kravchenko and Ms Pivovar were also PBC \nemploye es. \nAA4/1/18\n \n15 \n 43.3 4.3.13: Mr Kazantsev sen t an internal email setting out funds “ expected to arrive today ” \nand saying that “ [o]n 04/03/13, dollars are to be sold, loans are to be repaid ” {E1/262} . \nThe attachment  to his email  shows a proposal to issue loans to repay the principal \nand/or interest on existing loans. Some of the listed borrowers are Relevant \nBorrowers, some are Intermediary Borrowers, some are neither { E1/26 3}. \n44. Examples of recycling before the Relevant Drawdowns  were issued  (3.4.13- 1.11.13) : \n44.1 15.7.13: In a Skype message  to Irina Semenyuta (Deputy Head of the  Payment \nProcessing Department,  BOK ) and Alla Taranenko  (Deputy Head  of Foreign \nExchange Operations, BOK),  Ms Suprun issued the following instruction:  \n“SOLMBRIDGE TOV – credit 8,000,000.00 and repay the FABORIS TOV  loan – credit \n7,000,000.00 and repay the Unistroy loan – 49 million for mandatory sale .” {K6/23.2/4} . \nSolmbridge and Faboris are Relevant Borrowers  but no Relevant Drawdo wns had \nyet been made (although the Relevant Loans had been issued) . \n44.2 13.9.13: In a Skype message, Tatiana Gubanova  (Deputy Head of BOK and Foreign \nExchange  Operations ) and three other employees of the Foreign Exchange \nOperations Department  (Irina Karaban, Antonina Stets and Nataliya Ageeva ) \ndiscussed  the use of loans to repay other loans e.g.  “Today , the scenario is : Gardera  LLC  \n-18, Amadoras  LLC -25, Foks Trading  LLC  15 are paid from the loan, receiving a refund, \nthey’re selling "}
{"start": 45500, "text": " been made (although the Relevant Loans had been issued) . \n44.2 13.9.13: In a Skype message, Tatiana Gubanova  (Deputy Head of BOK and Foreign \nExchange  Operations ) and three other employees of the Foreign Exchange \nOperations Department  (Irina Karaban, Antonina Stets and Nataliya Ageeva ) \ndiscussed  the use of loans to repay other loans e.g.  “Today , the scenario is : Gardera  LLC  \n-18, Amadoras  LLC -25, Foks Trading  LLC  15 are paid from the loan, receiving a refund, \nthey’re selling –  buying, repaying dollar loan  Nordis+  - 25 million, selling dollars from loan, a fter \nrepayment paying off dollar loan , AEF - 5.0 selling from loan , after repayment  paying  [off] dollar \nloan.” {K6/25/2 }. The sums recorded in relation to Gardera and Amadoras (both \nIntermediary Borrowers)  match Intermediary Drawdowns. AEF is a Relevant \nBorrower, but no Relevant Drawdowns had been made by this date. Foks Trading is an Intermediary Borrower but had made no Intermediary Drawdown s by this date. \nNordis Plus in a non- relevant  borrower.  \n44.3 24.9.13: In a Skype message, Ms Gubanova  told Ms Ageeva: “ Faboris is paying 62, 2 is \nbeing refunded to Freeline, and the balance of 60.0 is going to AEF. Please prepare the instructions. \nThere is no sale there -- everyone is paying off USD loans …. I’ll consult with the credit team now \nto find ou t which is more important for AEF to pay off, USD or UAH…AEF – needs to pay \noff the UAH loan in the amount of UAH 71,720,852.51 using the UAH from the sale. For the rest, let them buy USD and repay USD ” {K6/26.3/ 3-5}. Faboris is a Relevant \nBorrower, but whilst a Relevant Loan had been made to it  by this date, this is not a  \nAA4/1/19\n \n16 \n Relevant Drawdown. The message envisages that  the drawdown will be used to pay \noff loans to Freeline ( a non -relevant  borrower) and AEF (a Relevant Borrower).  \n45. Examples of r ecycling using Relevant Loans, Relevant Drawdowns (1.11.13- 1.9.14) and \nIntermediary Drawdowns ( 26.2.13- 9.6.15) :  \n45.1 17.2.14: Mr Kazan tsev email ed a number of other employees saying “ We are closing \nthe lines that were opened for these companies. We are opening new lines with the same total limit, \nfor 3 years.” He lists Relevant Borrowers Vialint, Imris, Metrikom, Prado and Favore . \nRelevant Loans were issued to these companies  shortly thereafter  {E3/78}  \n45.2 23.5.14: In a Skype message, Mr Kazantsev told  Oksana Gudym (Senior Specialist in \nFinancing of Trading Companies , BOK ) “Disbursement to Empire  109,093.28 UAH  \n[an Empire Intermediary Drawdown]  …technical disbursement …someone else will repay the \nsame amount ” {K6/41.4/2} . \n45.3 23.6.14: In a Skype chat, Mr Kazantsev and Tatiana Tishkova ( Senior Specialist in \nFinancing of Trading Com panies, BOK) discuss ed the issuance of Relevant \nDrawdowns to  Tamersa, Viitella and Real -Standar t and an Intermediary Drawdown \nto Inkom.

She ask ed \nwhat explanation to give “for the back office: technical disbursement , the same amount will be \nrepaid? ”. Mr Kazantsev replie d in the affirmative  {K6/41.18/2} .  \n45.5 21-29.7.14: In a series of Skype messages, Ms Taranenko, Ms Gubanova and Mr \nKazantsev stated  the purpose s of some  Cambel Intermediary Drawdowns  variously  \nas “to repay …foreign currency ”, “for repayment of foreign currency  loans”, “for the purchase of \nUSD 10 million to repay  the foreign  currency loan ” {K6/42.1 }.  \n45.6 28.8.14: In a Skype chat, Ms Taranenko told Inna Demidchenko (Deputy Head of \nClient Lending, BOK)  “Loan is for the Dorteks purchase of Dorteks 460,694,152.71 UAH \n[matching the total of the Dorteks  Relevant Drawdowns of 28.8.14]  for the purchase of \n33 million doll"}

The spreadsheet listed a set of loans “ that are \nwithdrawn from the refinancing collateral ” (comprising some Re levant Loans , some \nIntermediary Loans  and some non- relevant loans) and a list of loans “ offered for \nreplacement in refinancing ” (also comprising some Relevant Loans, some Intermediary \nLoans and some non- relevant loans ). \n46. Examples of recycling using  non-relevant loans  or non- relevant drawdowns  during the  \nRelevant Drawdown  period  (1.11.13- 1.9.14) : \n46.1 18.11.13: in a Skype message, Ms Suprun asked Oksana  Ustimenko  (Plyuta)  (Senior \nSpecialist in Financing of Trading Companies, BOK ) “are you giving  UAH for Diletra  \n[a non-relevant  borrower]  today? ”. Ms Ust imenko  replied “ I am disbursing it. It  is with \nPonomarev for signature ”. Ms Suprun asked “ and what loans do they then repay? ” to which \nMs Ustimenko  responded “ they are paying off everything on the principal  4D13318I  [a non-\nrelevant loan] ” {K6/26.4/ 8}. \n46.2 17.12.13: in Skype messages, Ms Suprun and Elena Polischuk (Senior Specialist in \nFinancing of Trading Companies, BOK ) discuss ed how funds to be received that \nday by Solmbridge should be used e.g.  “Hello!

Solmbrid ge is a Relevant \nBorrower but the funds discussed do not match a Relevant Drawdown.  \n46.3 5.6.14: In a Skype message, Mr Kazantsev set out the intended usage of a series of \ndrawdowns, including “ Milorin 1, 766,461.55 for PF .

Whilst the Milorin figure matches a Relevant Drawdown \nand the Inkom figure an Intermediary Drawdown, the Orbela sum does not match \nwith a Relevant or Intermediary Drawdown.  \n46.4 23.6.14: Mr Barsuk sen t a Skype message asking generally for informat ion on accrued \ninterest and loan account arrears “ [t]o prepare financing for the payment  of interest under the  \nloan agreements ”.

Drawing these strands together, the Relevant Loans, Relevant Drawdowns, Intermediary \nLoans and Intermediary Drawdowns do not appear to have been treated differently from \nother loans and drawdowns issued by the Bank. Rather, they fit into a wider pattern of borrowing and repayment , which was operative well before the Bank started to approve the \nRelevant Loans and continued long after the final Relevant Drawdown.  \n49. Consistently with this, many emails and Skypes between Bank employees refer to drawdowns as “ Technical issuance ” or “ technical disbursement ”, saying the amounts will be used  \nto repay previous loan s and/ or will be repaid. For example, an email from Mr Kazantsev to \nTatiana Gurieva  (Deputy Chairman of the Management Board and Head of BOK), Svetlana \nShcherbakova ( First Deputy Head  of BOK , Lending to Trading Companies)  and others of \n12.5.14 listed “ Technical disbursement[s] ” including three Relevant Drawdowns. He said that \nthe “ Purpose ” was “ Technical disbursement ” and that the “ same amount will be repa id” {E3/225} . \nAA4/1/22\n \n19 \n 50. The idea of a wider pattern of borrowing is also consistent with the accounting analysis of \nthe Relevant Drawdowns ( Section D below), which shows  that the Relevant Drawdowns \nwere used to repay other loans issued by the Bank and were in turn largely repaid.  \n51. As a matter of principle, all transactions within this  wider  pattern should be treated in the \nsame way, both in legal and accounting terms. How ever, the Bank ’s case  rejects  any such \nconsistency of treatment , saying that repayments of Relevant Loans should be ignored whilst \nrelying upon Relevant Loans which repaid previous borrowing . \nB3. THE “SCHEME ” IN REALITY : “FIREFIGHTING ” AS AN A LTERNATIVE EXPLAN ATION  \n52. There is no suggestion in the documents  that this loan recycling, or any of the other  \ntransactions on which the Bank focuses , were part of a  narrow  masterminded “Scheme”  \ncontrolled by Mr Bogolyubov . Rather, the documents suggest that at least some of these \ntransactions  were part of a series of  sporadic (and often chaotic) responses by Bank \nemployees to banking regulations and audits  or NBU requirements .  \n53. Mr Bogolyubov does not attempt to provide a complete al ternative explanation for what \nwas happening at the Bank. This is not within his knowledge and, as explained in Section \nC below, he was not involved. Rather, this section highlights some aspects of the context of \nthe transactions and suggests some possible  alternative explanations for the Bank \nemployees’  behaviour.  \n54. The regulatory landscape in which the Bank operated included (non- exhaustively) (i) limits \non the Bank’s ability to lend foreign currency to domestic borrowers without foreign \ncurrency income; ( ii) limits on the ability of the Bank and Ukrainian borrowers to purchase \nforeign currency; (iii) regulations requiring Ukrainian companies to convert a certain \npercentage of their foreign currency income into hryvnia ; (iv) minimum capital adequacy \nratios;  and (v) maximum credit risk ratios for related party transactions.

The regulators also \ncame to insist on greater Supervisory Board engagement with the management \ncommittees .22 \n55. Two aspects of this regulatory landscape are used here  to illustrate possible a lternative \nexplanations for some elements of the Bank’s case:  \n \n22  Bank Opening/ 112-114 {AA2/1/53} draws attention to this feature without any reference to the changing \nregulatory demands.  See for example the recommendations at {E4/276/2}  and the requirements cited at \n{E9/95/31 -2}. \nAA4/1/23\n \n20 \n 55.1 First, the Bank alleges that the Misappropriation was in part carried out through the \nuse of Unreturned Prepayments paid pursuant to sham RSA s. As shown below, an \nalternative explanation is tha t Bank  employees  were simply using the appearance of \nsupply agreements and prepayments to get around restrictions on lending in foreign \ncurrency  or to cover up breaches of those restrictions . The Bank’s ability to lend \nforeign currency  was hindered by the passing of fresh NBU regulations in mid- 2014.  \nIt appears that even the Bank accept s23 that the passing of NBU Resolution 540 on \n29.8.14 and the imposition of a requirement for foreign currency purchase requests \nto be submitted to the N BU in a  register may have influenced events at the Bank \npost-1.9.14 . \n55.2 Secondly, the Bank alleges that the Misappropriation was in part hidden through Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov “ taking steps to hide their affiliations with the Borrowers \nfrom the NBU ”: RRRRAPOC/52(1)(viii) {A1/2/30} . As shown below, the \ndocuments do not support the Bank’s case that Bank employees were taking  steps \nto hide connections between Borrowers and Mr Kolomoisky or Mr Bogolyubov \nfrom the NBU . Rather, it appears they were taking steps to attempt to comply  with \ncredit risk ratios for related party lending  as between groups of lenders . At any rate, \nas explained in Section C, there is no evidence that Mr Bogolyubov took any part \nin, or knew of,  these actions.  \n56. Two chronologies  showing in more detail how Bank employees responded to the NBU’s \nchanging foreign currency controls and related party lending restrictions are appended at \nSchedules 3 and 4 for the Court’s reference.  \n(1) Foreign currency control s: use of supply agreements and prepayments  \n57. Borrowing , lending  in and the purchase of foreign currency were tightly controlled by  the \nNBU. Bank employees appear to have used supply agreements , prepayments  and loan \nrepayment  to get around or obscure past breaches of  three particular restrictions:  \n57.1 first, the NBU ’s prohibition on the Bank lending foreign currency to domestic \nborrowers with no foreign currency reserves or revenue sources : see e.g. {E2/75}  \n{E13/5.03/3} . It appears that Bank employees sought to get around this restriction \n \n23  See Bank Opening/235  {AA2/1/103 }. \nAA4/1/24\n \n21 \n by creating at least the appearance that the domestic borrower had a  prospective \nsource of foreign currency income by creating  supply agreements  and prepayments ;  \n57.2 secondly , the NBU ’s requ irement that, if domestic companies made prepayments to \nforeign companies under supply agreements, either those prepayments were \nreturned, or the relevant goods imported within 90 days. It appears that Bank \nemployees sought to get around this limit by claiming previous supply agreements \nand prepayments had been replaced by fresh ones, thus resetting the 90 -day period \non loop;  \n57.3 thirdly , the obligation to convert  a certain proportion of borrowers’  foreign currency \nreceipts  into hryvnia . \n58. The supply"}

It appears that Bank \nemployees sought to get around this limit by claiming previous supply agreements \nand prepayments had been replaced by fresh ones, thus resetting the 90 -day period \non loop;  \n57.3 thirdly , the obligation to convert  a certain proportion of borrowers’  foreign currency \nreceipts  into hryvnia . \n58. The supply agreements c reated for this purpose were often backdated and their authenticity \n– and the authenticity of references to them in the Bank’s transactional data – is not admitted \nby Mr Bogolyubov  in the absence of any evidence  from the Bank as to the reliability of the \ncontents of the  relevant  data fields : see D2’s Notice to Prove {B5/3 }. In particular, it \nappears from the documents that the supply agreements  were in some cases signed only \nafter the date of the transactions in relation to which they appear as a reference (see e.g. \n{E4/213}  showing a request  of 4.8.14 for the execution of RSA 240714- TU/1 between \nUniks and Teamtrend, where this agreement appears in the reference for a prepayment from \nUniks to Teamtrend on 1.8.14 { D2/9/609 }).24 It also appears that it may have been possible \nto delete or alter transactions even after they had been entered into the transaction data: see e.g., {K6/43.1/16} . It is therefore unclear whether each of the supply agreement references \nwere actually included in the transaction data at the time or whether some of them may have \nbeen inserted later on.  \n(i) Restrictions on lending in foreign curren cy to domestic borrowers   \n59. It seems that Bank employees began to use  supply agreements to create the appearance that \ndomestic borrowers had foreign currency receipts well before the Relevant Drawdowns began  in November 2013. For example:  \n59.1 On 4.3.13, Mr Kazan tsev emailed other Bank employees setting out a list of \ncompanies in relation to which “ dollars are to be sold, loans are to be repaid”. He attached \n \n24  The Bank’s suggestion at Bank Opening/198(5)  {AA2/1/90 } that RSAs were not backdated is incorrect.  \nAA4/1/25\n \n22 \n a document showing how loans were to be replaced and stating that a supply \nagreement was required “ to “ensu re” future foreign currency receipts ” {E1/262}  {E1/263} . \n59.2 An internal Bank “ matrix ” circulated in April 2013 details the procedure for issuing \nloans in foreign currency . This  included “ [n]otification of clients of the need to submit \ncontracts securing future currency receipts to the Bank” { E1/330} .  \n59.3 An email from Natalia Shvetsova  (Head of Pledged Property Monitoring \nDepartment, BOK ) to Mr Melnik of 16.4.13 {E1/314 } stated:  \nIn connection with foreign currency lending, there are problems with creation \nof provision for enterprises that do not have currency earnings. The total \nprovision formed for such enterprises is reflected on the bank's correspondence \naccount, which is categorically prohibited by the Chairman of the Management \nBoard. These risks can be m inimised by executing an additional collateral in the \nform of property rights to the goods .  \n59.4 In an email to Olga Koryak  (Head of Legal Support Department , BOK ) of 18.4.13 \nregarding a response the Bank was preparing to questions raised by the NBU, Dmitry \nLuchaninov (Head of the Compliance Department)  stated “ I don’t quite understand the \nanswer….in Ukraine it is forbidden to make loans in foreign currency ” {E1/321 }. Ms Koryak \nresponded:  \nIf NBU thinks that our bank simply loaned up a client (issued foreign currency, \nthe client sold it and paid us back in hryvnias), that didn't happen. It was all \nmore elegant. The clients took loans and made payme nts to counter -parties, the \ncounter -parties paid off the loans.  \n59.5 In the Bank’s draft response of 1.8.13 to the NBU’s request for an explanation of its  \ncompliance with this limitatio"}
{"start": 63000, "text": "raine it is forbidden to make loans in foreign currency ” {E1/321 }. Ms Koryak \nresponded:  \nIf NBU thinks that our bank simply loaned up a client (issued foreign currency, \nthe client sold it and paid us back in hryvnias), that didn't happen. It was all \nmore elegant. The clients took loans and made payme nts to counter -parties, the \ncounter -parties paid off the loans.  \n59.5 In the Bank’s draft response of 1.8.13 to the NBU’s request for an explanation of its  \ncompliance with this limitation on foreign currency lending, the Bank submitted a \nnumber of supply agreeme nts entered into by the domestic borrowers as “ confirmation \nof the adequacy of foreign currency revenues ”, saying  that the contracts “ show the bank had \ndocuments confirming the expectation of receipt of foreign currency earnings ” {E2/74 } {E2/75 }.  \n60. Bank employees appear to have continued to use supply agreements in this way  in relation \nto the Relevant Loans. For example:   \n60.1 In an email of 10.4.14 with subject “ Contracts requested by [ the] NBU ”, Ms Shvetsova \nasked Mr Melnik to assist in speeding up the si gning of a list of supply contracts for \na number of borrowers. The attached spreadsheet lists a number of Relevant \nAA4/1/26\n \n23 \n Borrowers for which “ [t]here is no signed contract with a non -resident ” and sets out (non-\nrelevant) supply contracts for signature  (all of wh ich are dated before the date of the  \nemail ) {E3/184} {E3/185} . \n60.2 On 20.2.15 the  NBU  made a request  (Request No.43) for explanation of the Bank’s \nalleged “failure to comply with the following restrictions on the Bank’s activities…To provide loans \nto domestic borrowers without foreign currency revenues only in domestic currency ”. The NBU \nprovided a list of loans in relation to which it sought explanation, which included a \nnumber of Relevant Loans25 {E8/2 9/2}. The Bank’s response state d that all \nborrowers had “ foreign currency  receipts …Borrowers also provided export contracts under which \nthere were planned foreign currency receipts for delivery of goods or equipment .” {E8/26 } {E8/27}  \n{E8/60.2} . In a Skype message  to Ms Koryak  of 25.2.15, Mr Luchaninov suggested \nthat the Bank also add “details rega rding the volume of available agreements on the date of \nconclusion of the loan in  foreign currency ” and “ substantiation that there is a methodology for \ncalculating foreign currency receipts as at a specific date”  {K6/69.1/ 3-5}. \n60.3 On 30.3.15, Mr Luchaninov asked Vladimir Yatsenko  (Deputy Chair of Management \nBoard, Head of the Corporate VIP Business Unit)  to approve “ the submission of loan \nagreements for foreign currencies for 37 customers to the NBU auditors ”. This was in response \nto an NBU request for foreign currency loan agreements  issued by the Bank between \n1.1.14 and 1.3.15  (a period in which over half the Relevant Loans were issued)  \n{E8/129.8 }. Mr Luchaninov’s email  listed many Relevant Borrowers  and he \nexplained to Mr Yatsenko that “ [a]ccording to the agreed procedure, customers were given loans \nin domestic and foreign currency and then the funds were transferred as advance payment under \nforeign trade agreements ” {E8/143 }. \n60.4 On 16.4.15, in its  response to the NBU ’s finding of failure to comply with the  \nrestriction on providing loans to domestic borrowers without foreign currency \nrevenues, the Bank relied inter alia on the existence of “ export contracts under which there \nwere planned foreign currency receipts for delivery of goods and equipment ” {E8/264 } ¶5.3. \n61. Once again, no apparent distinction was  drawn by Bank employees between the supply \nagreements used in relatio n to non- relevant loans and in relation to Relevant Loans.  \n \n25 Loans to Inkom, Uniks, Milorin,  Empire,  Tekhspetsmontazh, Transmol oko and Inkeriya  \nAA4/1/27\n \n24 \n (ii) 90-day limit  for return of foreign currency  pre-payments  \n62.

{"start": 66500, "text": "eipts for delivery of goods and equipment ” {E8/264 } ¶5.3. \n61. Once again, no apparent distinction was  drawn by Bank employees between the supply \nagreements used in relatio n to non- relevant loans and in relation to Relevant Loans.  \n \n25 Loans to Inkom, Uniks, Milorin,  Empire,  Tekhspetsmontazh, Transmol oko and Inkeriya  \nAA4/1/27\n \n24 \n (ii) 90-day limit  for return of foreign currency  pre-payments  \n62. The documents support an argument  that Bank employees were attempting to arrange  \nsupply contracts and prepayments on a rolling basis to reset the 90 -day period for the return \nof foreign currency . They also suggest t hat the RSA s and Unreturned Prepayments were \nused in this way  (which the Bank appears to accept : Bank Opening/226 -234) {AA2/1/100 -\n103}. For example:    \n62.1 In a Skype message of 6.5.14, Mr Barsuk and Marina Dashevskaya (Leading Specialist \nin Fin ancing of Industrial Companies, BOK ) appear to have discussed the \nreplacement of supply contracts and prepayments: e.g. “I will have to redo the contract for \nagropromte khnologi ya and there will be a new non -resident. We leave the old collateral as I \nunders tand it, and we will just take the new one as collateral ” {K6/40/2- 3}. (Note : this \nprecedes the RSA s, the first of which was dated  14.5.14.)  \n62.2 In a Skype message of 3.6.14, Ms Dashevskaya asked  “For Saltiz are there new draft \ncontracts for collateral, the prepayment has been returned? ”. In response, Mr Barsuk sent a file  \nnamed  “Trade Point Agro Limited – Saltiz #ST -01-05 dd 25.05.14” { K6/40/9} . (Note: \nSaltiz is a Relevant Borrower , but this  contract  is not a n RSA .) \n62.3 In a Skype message of 28.8.14, Ms Taranenko  told Ms Gubanova that “ 90 days comes \non 02.09.2014 for INKOM 2001 TOV 5 million, TRANSMOLOKO TOV 10 million, \nand Tekhspetsmontazh  17” {K6/46.3/ 4}. On 29.8.14, Mr Barsuk sent Ms Taranenko \nthe names  of two RSA s “Inkom No 20.08-TI/14 -4 dated 20.08.2014 . Transmoloko No \nTM-2108-2014 dated 21.08.2014.”  {K6/47.2/ 3}. On 1.9.14, three Relevant \nDrawdowns were made in the same sums ( as recorded in Ms Taranenko’s message \n{K6/46.2/4} ). The forensic accounting  analysis served by Mr Davidson shows that \naccording to the tra nsactional data the Relevant Drawdowns were paid out (with \nreference to these RSA s) to Defendant Suppliers, who in turn used the mone y to \nrepay previous prepayments made by the Borrowers under supply agreements approximately 90 days earlier. The Borrowers in turn used the money to repay \nprevious loans to the Bank (see e.g. { D2/9/592 } for Transmoloko, diagram ref 3).  \n63. The entries in the free -text field (the authenticity of which is not admitted ) of the  \ntransactional data relating to the Relevant Drawdowns  are consistent with Bank employees \nusing at least the appearance of supply agreements and prepayments to reset the 90 -day \nperiod. For example:  \nAA4/1/28\n \n25 \n 63.1 In relation to the AEF Relevant Drawdown  of 27.12.13, the  transactional data \nrecords that AEF made  a prepayment on 27.12.13 to Kalten under RSA ST -01/77 \ndated 24.12.13. Th e funds were  returned by Kalten to AEF the same day with the \ntransactional data recording  that the funds were the return of a prepayment under  a \nprevious supply agreement ST -01/65 DD dated  4.9.13, just over three months earlier  \n{D2/9/5 -6}.  \n63.2 In relation to the Darsten Relevant Drawdown  of 17.2.14, the transactional data \nrecords that Darsten made a prepayment on 18.2.14 to Eurotyre under RSA K2901 -\n14 dated 29.1.14. The funds were returned by Eurotyre to Darsten on the same day \nwith the transactional data record ing that the funds were the return of a prepayment \nunder contract 0511 -13 dated 20.11.13, three months earlier  {D2/9/26- 27}. \n64.

This system of technical issuance of replacement  loans, supply agreements and prepayments \nis recorded in various spreadsheets produced by Bank employees, which appear to have \nbeen designed to keep track of what prepayments needed to be “ replaced ” within each 90 -\nday period and which supply agreements and prepayments were used to “ replace ” them e.g. \n{E4/344} { E4/345 } {E4/346} . The Gurieva Spreadsheet, upon which the Bank places \nheavy reliance, appears to be simply one such record  {E18/213 }, as does the Kazantsev \nSpreadsheet  {E7/39} . However, these spreadsheets do not reflect the reality of the fund \nflows. The suggestion that the Kazantsev S preadsheet  is a record  that prepayments were \nreturned to Borrowers within 90 days26 is to confuse the appearance with actuality.  The \nspreadsheet s are artefactual , record ing the legend t he Bank was seeking to promote rather \nthan the real tr ansactions and their true purpose.   \n(iii) The obligation to convert foreign currency receipts  into hryvnia  \n65. A further currency control put in place by the NBU was  the obligation for Ukrainian \nresidents  to convert a certain proportion of their foreign currenc y receipts under foreign \ntrade contracts into hryvnia (often referred to as “mandatory sale” or “compulsory sale”) . \nThe recipient’s Ukrainian bank was obliged t o carry out this sale  {C1/79 }. This control was \nin place throughout the relevant period, albeit the proport ion of receipts that had to be \nconverted fluctuated over time. From 19.11.12- 20.8.14, it was 50% ; from 21.8.14- 22.9.14, it \n \n26  Bank Opening/210  {AA2/1/95 } \nAA4/1/29\n \n26 \n was 100%; from 23.9.14- 8.6.16, it was 75%; and from 9.6.16- 5.4.17, it was 65%: Beketov  \n8/374 { C1/1/126 }.  \n66. Skype messages show the Bank employees discussing the mandatory sale requirements upon \nthe receipt of foreign currency by borrowers, including discussing the repurchase of USD with the hryvnia  obtained through mandatory sale. For example, in a conversation of \n27.12.13 between Ms Ustimenko and Ms Suprun { K6/26.4/11 -15}: \nMs Ustimenko: “the 12,840,612.45 dollars that came in for Faboris today, is it \nsubject to mandatory sale or are we paying off foreign currency loans there?”  \nMs Suprun: “I don’t know yet”  \nMs Ustimenko: “because it is drawing from the hryvnia (capitalised) for loan 4F13190D [another Faboris loan]”.  \nMs Suprun: “ when this amount comes in, we will sell 50/50 and buy and pay \noff what you say”.  \nMs Ustimenko: “I did not understand, we sell 50%, we get the hryvnia and buy \ndollars again? ”  \nMs Suprun: “ Yes that’s right ”.  \nMs Ustimenko: “ that is, in the end we have this full amount in dollars? ”  \nMs Suprun: “ they have outstanding dollar loans …we will buy  out and receive \nthe total amount in dollars ”.  \n67. The Bank appear s to have used the continuous replacement of supply agreements and \nprepayments as a way of complying with the mandatory conversion of foreign currency.   \n(iv) Supposed end of the “Scheme”  with the Un returned Prepayments  \n68. The Bank claims that the “Scheme”  “ended” in early September 2014 in response to \nincreasing NBU scrutiny of the Bank’s compliance with foreign currency regulations: Bank \nOpening/235   {AA2/1/103 }. However, it is clear that the “Unreturned” Prepayments were \nnot the end of the “Scheme” . Rather, the form of the Bank’s response to foreign currency \nregulat ions changed. For example, it appears that the so- called 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings \nwere the next step, designed to avoid substantial penalties under the foreign currency regulations if prepayments were not recorded as being returned.\n27 The bringing of the  \nUkrainian proceedings is the obvi"}

For example, it appears that the so- called 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings \nwere the next step, designed to avoid substantial penalties under the foreign currency regulations if prepayments were not recorded as being returned.\n27 The bringing of the  \nUkrainian proceedings is the obvious reason for the Kazantsev Spreadsheet ceasing to be \nupdated. It does not evidence the end of the “ Scheme” . \n \n27  Bank Opening/237  {AA2/1/104 } \nAA4/1/30\n \n27 \n 69. Equally, there is no evidence that in reality “ D3-8 had received the benefit of a prepayment for which \nit had ne ither delivered goods nor returned the money ” or that “ the loss to the Bank…was in the amount \nof the unrepaid Relevant Drawdowns ”.28 All that had happened is that, by reason of the change \nin the regulatory environment, the method for recording the circular payments was changed. \nThe reality remained (as shown in Section D below) that the money had been returned by \nD3-8 and used to repay  other lending, and in due course that the Relevant D rawdowns \nwould be (and were) repaid. The portrayal of September 2014 as the end of “ the ‘active’ phase \nof the Misappropriation ” (Bank Opening/248)  {AA2/1/107 } is a false narrative driven by the \nexigencies of the claim to English jurisdiction.  \n70. Further detail of the Bank’s responses to fluctuating foreign currency regulations is given in \nSchedule 3.  \n(2) Credit risk ratios for  related party lending  \n71. The NBU also placed restrictions on the maximum amount of lending that could be made \nby the Bank to related parties, or to groups of related parties , calculated as ratios of the \nBank’s regulatory capital (the N7, N8 and N9 ratios29): Beketov 8, Section M7 { C1/1/151} . \n72. The documents suggest that Bank employees were concerned about the Bank’s ability to \ncomply  with these ratio s. For example:  \n72.1 On 9.1.14, Evgeny Rudenko (Deputy Head, Compliance Department ) sent Svetlana \nDudko (Head of Department for Development of Technologies for Calculation and \nControl of Economic Standards, Head Office)  a list of new related companies. \nGayane Babich (Deputy Head of Ms Dudko’s department)  analysed these and \nconcluded that the “ debts of BOK’s customers…exceed the maximum limit set by the NBU \nfor total insider debt ” {E2/275} {E2/276 }.  \n72.2 Similarly, on 11.3.14, Natalia Dyachenko  (Deputy Head of Risk Management \nDivision , Head of Risk Control Department , BOK ) sent Ms Dudko a presentation \non related borrower groups, flagging those where the group borrowing appeared to \nhave exceeded the relevant ratio. She proposed that groups with debt over UAH 4bn \n \n28  Bank Opening/236  {AA2/1/104 } \n29  Depending on the transliteration, these ratios are sometimes referred to as N7, N8, N9 and sometimes as H7, \nH8, H9.  \nAA4/1/31\n \n28 \n be analysed and proposals made for “ saving a group or modification of a group… ” \n{E3/121 } {E3/122/8 }.  \n72.3 On 23.4.14, Vyacheslav  Vetluzhskikh ( Head of Internal Audit) asked Mr Luchaninov \nto consider the possible sanctions from the NBU if the Bank breached the related \nparty credit risk concentration ratios { E3/208 }. \n72.4 On 19.6.14,  Mr Luchaninov emailed Ms Dyachenko concerning a number of newly \nidentified affiliated borrowers “ which could potentially both form groups among themselves and \naffect credit risk conce ntration rate for insiders”. He emphasised “ the urgency of the disaffiliating \nproblem ” {E4/47 }. \n72.5 On 19 -20.8.14, Ms Dyachenko, Mr Rudenko and Vladyslav Morgach ev (General \nManager, Cyprus Branch ) amongst others  discussed the potential need “ to unlink  the \nben[eficial] owners ” if the Bank could not “ defend ” the related party groups, as otherwise \n“then the bank has no capital ” {K6/45.4/ 2-9}. \n72.6 In Skype messages of 25.12"}

The Luchaninov Email (discussed further in Section C5(3)  below), appears to have fallen \nwithin this pattern of behaviour. It does not show – and there is no evidence of  – Mr \nBogolyubov taking steps to “ hide” his affiliations  with the Borrowers from the NBU. I t \nappears that the Bank employees sometimes took steps to alter the connections between \nborrowers (for example by changing directors, or even sometimes “ unlinking ” beneficial \nowners) in order to comply with the credit ris k ratios on related party lending. This had been \nhappening since  2010,  and Mr Luchaninov had been promoting a process of  borrower  \ndisaffiliation to avoid credit risk concentration problems since June 2014 if not earlier  \n{E4/47} . Further detail of this is given in Schedule 4.  \nAA4/1/32\n \n29 \n B4. ACCOUNTING ANALYSIS : ABSENCE OF INDICATIONS OF MISAPPROPRIATION  \n74. Consistently with the above, analysis of the Bank’s accounts over the relevant time period \nalso yields an absence of indications of misappropriation.  \n75. As Mr Steadman  (D2’s forensic accountancy expert)  explains  (Steadman  1/Section 5)  \n{D3/1/24 -27}:30  \n75.1 the Relevant Drawdowns did not contribute to any significant  increase in the value \nof the principal of the Bank’s lending to a set of borrowers  including the Borrowers, \nIntermediary Borrowers, New Borrowers  and Suppliers . The total increase in \nRelevant Customer loans over the period 1.11.13 to 1.9.14 was c. USD 690m, of \nwhich c. USD 618m related to interest  accrued on those loans . The remaining c. \nUSD 72m is approximately 3% of the Relevant Drawdowns of c. USD 2.3bn ; and   \n75.2 the funds representing the Relevant Drawdowns were not sent outside the Bank , as \nmight be expected if the funds were being misappropriated.   \n76. Moreover, as explained in Section D below, the Relevant Drawdowns were used to repay \nother loans and were  in turn  almost entirely  repaid.  \n77. None of the above  is consistent with a misappropriation via  the Relevant Drawdowns to the \nultimate benefit of Mr Bogolyubov.  \n  \n \n30  Mr Thompson’s criticisms of this analysis (Thompson 2/6.21ff) {D1/347/79}  are dealt with in Steadman 3, \nSection 3 { D3/13/11 } \nAA4/1/33\n \n30 \n C. MR BOGOLYUBOV’S ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN THE “SCHEME”  \n78. There is no evidence that Mr Bogolyubov was aware of, let alone involved in, still less \nresponsible for, the whole or any part of any fraudulent borrowing. In particular, there is no evidence of his knowledge of, or involvement in, the procurement or approval of the \nRelevant Loans, the Intermediary Loans, the RSA s, the Unreturned Prepayments or the \nLoan File Supply Agreements.\n  \n79. It is notable that the Bank has not been able to produce  any direct evidence of Mr \nBogolyubov’s involvement in or awareness of the alleged fraud. Rather, it relies upon pure \ninference and suspicion. It  builds its case by piling inference upon inference, which it says \nin turn should be drawn from a mosaic of circumstantial material.  \n80. Not only is the Bank’s tower of inferences liable to collapse, but Mr Bogolyubov’s \ninvolvement in any fraud is not compatible with the contemporaneous documents.  \n81.

The Bank says that it should be inferred that there are documents showing Mr Bogolyubov’s knowledge of the alleged fraud and control of the Bank.  \n82. Yet, of all of the documents in the trial bundle containing  communications to which Mr \nBogolyubov is party , the overwhelming  majority concern Mr Bogolyubov’s own business \ninterests  or personal matters . Only c. 25\n31 have anything to do with the management of the \nBank and these are innocent and mundane communications.  None  of the documents \ncontain evidence that he was involved in or aware of any part of the Bank’s alleged “Scheme” .  \n83. What the documents clearly do show is who was involved in taking the actions (such as the \nissuance of Relevant Loans)  said by the Bank to comprise the “Scheme” . This is why the \nBank must rely so heavily upon actions taken by the Bank’s management team.  In this \nregard, the nature of the alle ged fraud is significant: it does not require the involvement of \nanyone outside those shown by the documents to be involved. Given this, there is no room \nfor an inference that Mr Bogolyubov was involved.  \n \n31  This number comprises communications (e.g. letters and emails) to which Mr Bogolyubov was a party. It does \nnot include Supervisory Board minutes (discussed below), the Deeds of Indemnity and Waiver, or IFRS related \nparty lists he signed.  \nAA4/1/34\n \n31 \n C1. APPROACH TO THE EVIDENCE  \n(1) Inferences of wrongdoing \n84. The following propositions govern how the Court should approach the  drawing of \ninferences from the  evidence in this case.  \n85. First, the Court ought to base its factual findings on inferences drawn from documentary \nevidence and known or probable facts: R (Dutta ) v General Medical Council  [2020] EWHC 1974 \n(Admin), [39]- [41] {M3/5}  (Warby J, distilling the principles set out in recent authorities \nconcerning the weight of oral and documentary evidence).  \n86. Secondly , in the context of claims of very serious wrongdoing,  “while the standard of proof \nremains the civil standard, in general terms, the more serious the alleged wrongdoing the less likely it is that \nit took place, and accordingly the evidence required to demonstrate the wrongdoing will need to be more cogent than what is necessary to prove mere negligence ”: ENRC v Dechert & Ors  [2022] EWHC 1138 \n(Comm) , [44(3)] (citing In Re B (Children) [2009] 1 AC 11, [13] -[15] and JSC BM Bank v \nKekhman  [2018] EWHC 79, [51] -[53]) {M3/9} . \n87. Thirdly , a lack of direct evidence is relevant to the Court’s ability to infer fraud, in particular \nwhere it is presented with rival explanations of a particular set of facts, one innocent (or \nnegligent) and one fraudulent. In particular:  \n87.1 it is not open to the Court to infer dishonesty from facts which are consistent with \nhonesty or negligence. There must be  some  fact which “ tilts the balance and justifies an \ninference of dishonesty ” and this fact must be both pleaded and proved: ED&F Man v \nCome Harvest [2022] EWHC 229 (Comm), [71(i)] {M3/8} ; and  \n87.2 “wherever the court is faced with a choice between two rival explanations of any particular incident, \none innocent and the other not. Unless it is dealing with known fraudsters, the court should start from a strong presumption that the innoc ent explanation is more likely to be correct ”: Jafari -Fini v \nSkillglass Ltd  [2007] EWCA Civ 261, [40]  {M3/1}.  \n88. Fourthly , an inference of fraud cannot be justified “ by lumping together a number of disparate \nallegations which bear no relation to the conspirac y, fraud or deceit which is said to sound in damages ” [477]. \nOne cann"}
{"start": 84000, "text": "icular incident, \none innocent and the other not.

Fourthly , an inference of fraud cannot be justified “ by lumping together a number of disparate \nallegations which bear no relation to the conspirac y, fraud or deceit which is said to sound in damages ” [477]. \nOne cannot “ jumble together a vast array of different, apparently trivial or marginally suspicious facts \nrelating to different matters and turn them in to a valid pleading of fraud” [479] – “the desire to allege \nfraud/dishonesty/conspiracy becomes a kind of philosopher’s stone which transforms innocent errors into dishonest conspiracies – from which in turn the main conspiracy can itself be inferred ” [482]: King v Stiefel  \nAA4/1/35\n \n32 \n [2021] EWHC 1045 (Comm) ( Cockerill J)  {M3/7} . Cockerill J also cautioned against “ circular \nreasoning ”, by relying on inferences to evidence dishonesty which themselves depend on an \nassumption of conspiracy: [481].  \n(2) The relevant context  \n89. The Ukrainian context is the background again st which the inherent probabilities of the \nBank’s case fall to be evaluated, see Picken J in Avonwick Holdings  Ltd v Azitio Holdings Ltd  \n[2020] EWHC 1844 (Comm) [104] -[105]  {M3/4} . What is inherently probable in a secure \nand relatively ordered banking sect or, governed by the Bank of England or the UK \nregulators, is not necessarily inherently probable in the conditions that prevailed in Ukrainian \ncommercial life and the Ukrainian banking sector in the 1990s through to 2016. Ukrainian  \neconomic and political l ife was subject to dramatic changes  between 2010 and 2016.    \n90. Arguments about whether Mr Bogolyubov could have been unfamiliar with the Bank’s lending book even as the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and whether he could have \nbeen ignorant of the activity of companies in which he held an interest and that may have \nbeen the beneficiaries of related party lending have to be assessed in the laissez faire  economic \ncontext evident in states like Ukraine emerging from the breakup of the Soviet Union. \n \n91. As Teare J observed in  Filatona Trading Ltd v Navigator Equities Ltd [2019] EWHC 173 \n(Comm) at [11] {M3/3} , citing Lord Bingham's 'The Business of Judging':   \nAn English judge may have, or thinks that he has, a shrewd idea how a Lloyd's \nbroker, or a Bristol wholesaler, or a Norfolk farmer, might react in some \nsituation which is canvassed in the course of a case but he may, and I think should, feel very much more uncertain about the reactions of a Nigerian \nmerchant, or an Indian ship's engineer, or a Jugoslav banker. Or even, to take a \nmore homely example, a Sikh shopkeeper tra ding in Bradford. No judge worth \nhis salt could possibly assume that men of different nationalities, educations, \ntrades, experience, creeds and temperaments would act as he might think he \nwould have done or even -  which might be quite different -  in accord ance with \nhis concept of what a reasonable man would have done.  \n92. Teare J stressed that the post breakup of the Soviet Union context may make inferences \nparticularly difficult to evaluate:   \nIn this case the probabilities must be assessed, as best this court can, in the light \nof the collapse of the USSR, the emergence of private enterprise in Russia, the \naccumulation of huge wealth by a few individuals, the manner in which \nAA4/1/36\n \n33 \n 'oligarchs' do business with each other, the importance of support from those \nin power,  the loyalties which huge wealth can generate and the use of offshore \ncompanies and trusts to hold (and hide) such wealth.  \n93. Gloster J made a similar observation in Berezovsky v Abramovich  [2012] EWHC 2463 (Comm) \nat [38] {M3/2} :  \nThe dispute between the two men has to be evaluated against the sometimes \nturbu"}
{"start": 87500, "text": "the \naccumulation of huge wealth by a few individuals, the manner in which \nAA4/1/36\n \n33 \n 'oligarchs' do business with each other, the importance of support from those \nin power,  the loyalties which huge wealth can generate and the use of offshore \ncompanies and trusts to hold (and hide) such wealth.  \n93. Gloster J made a similar observation in Berezovsky v Abramovich  [2012] EWHC 2463 (Comm) \nat [38] {M3/2} :  \nThe dispute between the two men has to be evaluated against the sometimes \nturbulent political and economic backcloth of Russia in the late 1990s and early \n2000s, and in the context of the deterioration of their relationship. Nonetheless, \nthe dispute is in essence a commercial one, wh ich, like any other tried in this \ncourt, has to be decided on the factual evidence, both oral and documentary, \nrelating to the specific transactions in issue. And, although this court necessarily \nviews that evidence 'Under Western Eyes', it  has to be caref ul about applying  \nwhat it might  regard  as conventional  Western  European  business  standards  to \njudge  the conduct  of businessmen operating  in the very different , and largely \nunregulated, commercial and political environment of Russia at the material \ntimes. A s I remind myself: '… this is not a story of the West of Europe'.  \n94. The relevant back story in Ukraine appears to have been one where related party lending \nand problems about bank capitalisation were not a source of any particular concern prior to 2014 and therefore not the subject of any significant scrutiny  and where businessmen \nhabitually held their assets in byzantine structures designed to defy penetration. As the annual report of the NBU for 2014 { E7/180} observed it was not until the Russian invasion \nof Crimea of 2014 that there was any effort by the NBU to impose  modern and transparent \nprocedures for monitoring and reporting related party lending or for disclosing the identity \nof a bank’s owners. Only in 2015 was the law changed to strengthen bank financial reporting and prudential supervision (see the annual report for 2015 at {E12/169 }).  \n95. There is therefore no reason to infer that any “Scheme”  or “Misappropriation” would \nnecessarily have been the subject of specific reporting to Mr Bogolyubov whether as a \nmember of the Supervisory Board or as a significant shareholder in the Bank.  \n96. Accordingly, in assessing the Bank’s case, close attention should be paid to the documents, \nconsi dered against the relevant context. What those documents show is considered in the \nfollowing Sections C2 -C6. In circumstances where Mr Bogolyubov has elected not to give \nevidence, the importance of closely considering the contemporaneous documents is \nincreased.  \nAA4/1/37\n \n34 \n C2. MR BOGOLYUBOV ’S INVOLVEMENT IN THE BANK   \n97. Mr Bogolyubov was a shareholder of the Bank (his shareholding fluctuating between 41.58% \nand 46.66% between 2011 and Nationalisation ), the Chairman of the Supervisory Board \n(1997 to May 2015)32 and a member of the Supervisory Board (May 2015 to Nationalisation), \nas well as being a client of the Bank.  \n98. Despite these formal positions, Mr Bogolyubov’s involvement in the Bank was in fact \nlimited. The evidence does not suggest that he took any substa ntial interest in the Bank’s \nactivities between 2010 and July 2014. After that time, his involvement was even more \nlimited, as he had taken a step back from the Bank and had  agreed that from 1.7.14 he would \nexercise his vote as a shareholder and role on th e Supervisory Board on Mr Kolomoisky’s \ninstruction.  \n(1) Mr Bogolyubov’s roles at the Bank  \n99. Of the  communications in the trial bundle to which Mr Bogolyubov was a party up to 1.7.14, \nthe overwhelming  majority relate to his own business interests.

Apart from Sup ervisory \nBoard minutes and IFRS lists signed by Mr Bogolyubov, there are on ly about  10 \ncommunications to which he is a party which relate to the management of the Bank .  \n100. Although Mr Bogolyubov was a shareholder and chairman of the Supervisory Board during this period, his role was limited and formal.\n33 In particular:  \n100.1  In his capacity as a shareholder, there is no evidence that Mr Bogolyubov benefit ted \nfrom his interest in the Bank. He took no dividends from it and he provided significant assets in an effort to support the balance sheet of the Bank.  \n100.2  In his capacity on the Supervisory Board:  \ni) He (and the Supervisory Board in general) was not involved in the day -to-day \nmanagement of the Bank: see the Bank’s Charter and Regulations { C1/211/1 2} \n(¶¶9.3- 9.4). \nii) Although he signed Supervisory Board minutes, in practice this amounted to \ngiving a formal stamp of approval to motions proposed by the Bank’s \n \n32  Various orders confirming and relating to Mr Bogolyubov’s employment as Chairman are at { E1/3 } \n33  The Bank suggests rath er desperately that Mr Bogolyubov “emphasised ” his position as Chair of Supervisory \nBoard in his CV as his “most important business role ”: Bank Opening/111  {AA2/1/53 }. The statement in his CV \nthat he is a  “member of the Supervisory Board ” {E12/168.1}  is simply a statement of fact. What he did  as a member \nof the Supervisory Board must be seen from the relevant documents.  \nAA4/1/38\n \n35 \n manag ement e.g. {K1/11 } {K1/16 }. Cons istently with this, the minutes do not \ncontain any record or notes of actual meetings being held  or of any debate \ntaking place .  \niii) He was not involved in the decisions said to comprise the “Scheme” .34 The \nresolutions approved by the Supervisory Board over the relevant time period \npertained to matters such as internal Bank regulations and governance, \nconvening shareholder meetings and approving the agenda, the issuance of \nbonds and securities by the Bank, approving the composition of the \nManagement Board and on one occasion approving a loan to a related party \n{K1/31 }.35 Contrary to the Bank’s suggestion, Mr Bogolyubov’s membership \nof the Supervisory Board is not “significant given its wide -ranging powers ”.36 What ever \ntheoretical powers the Supervisory Board had, what  is significant is the reality  \nthat it had no involvement in th e “Scheme” . It is common ground that  the \nRelevant Loans were not even referred to, let alone authorised by, the \nSupervisory Board.37 The same is true for the Intermediary Loans. In addition, \nalthough the Supervisory Board approved the Bank’s general policies for the \nproduction of related party lists  (a fact relied upon by the Bank: Bank \nOpening/114)  {AA2/1/54 }, it was not involved in the approval of the lists \nthemselves: see below , Section C5(1) . \n100.3  The simple frequency of Supervisory Board meetings (relied upon by the Bank: Bank \nOpening/112)  {AA2/1/53 } shows nothing about the actual involvement of the \nSupervisory Board in the “Scheme” . At any rate, as the Bank’s own figures show, the \nfrequency of Supervisory Board meetings increas ed noticeably  only after all the \nRelevant Loans (3.4.13 -  21.8.14) and Relevant Drawdowns  (3.4.13 - 1.11.13)  had \nbeen issued. The increase in frequency of meet ings was likely a response to the \nNBU’s criticism, explained in the following paragraph.   \n \n34 There is just one set of Supervisory Board minutes relating to one of the components of the alleged “cover -\nup” of the “Scheme” : this records that, in March 2016, the Supervisory Board gave consent to the Management \nBoard recognising Relevant Loan Transferred Assets ont"}

The limited involvement of the Supervisory Board in the management of the Bank was such \nthat, in August 2014,  the NBU concluded that the Supervisory Board was insuffi ciently \naware of the risks inherent in the Bank and that the Management Board was failing to keep \nthe Supervisory Board informed and acting without its consent even  where a joint decision \nof both Boards was required. For example, it found that:  \n101.1  there was “ insufficient awareness of the Supervisory Board about the risks inherent in the Bank’s \nactivities ”, in particular that “ the Supervisory Board is not fully informed about the risks that \ncreate a load on the Bank’s financial standing ” {E4/276/1 -2};  \n101.2  a “lack of proper control on the part of the Management Board” had led to “ non-compliance with \nrestrictions established by the terms of loan agreements with the National Bank; lack of adequate \nassessment of risks under credit transactions, accounts receivable and securities transactions; taking into account the calculation of the  reserve of unacceptable collateral; sufficiency of existing reserves for \nactive operations; provision  of statistical reports with errors to the National Bank of Ukraine; \nMisrepresentation in accounting for financial leasing and income/expenses; failure to  comply with \nthe requirements of the National Bank of Ukraine on provision of information to the consumer on the terms of crediting and the total cost of credit; failure to comply with the procedure for writing off \nbad debts on active transactions, etc .”;  \n101.3   the Management Board “ does not submit timely, meaningful, accurate and complete reports on \nthe management of significant risks and the methods of control over these risks to the Supervisory Board ”; and  \n101.4  the Management  Board was granting loans to manageri al staff of the Bank in excess \nof UAH 120,000 without the required joint decision of the Supervisory Board  \n{E4/276/12} .  \n102. It was not Mr Bogolyubov who controlled the Bank. In fact , he had no role in its day -to-\nday manag ement. Rather, it was Mr Dubilet who managed the Bank alongside other Bank \nexecutives {K5-A1/22/2 }. This was in acco rdance with the Bank’s Charter and Regulations \nwhich provided that the Management Board, as the executive body of the Bank , would \nmanage its day -to-day business {C1/211/16 } (¶9.4)  (and see also Pakhachuk 1/10 { B1/1/4 }, \nOleksiyenko 1/8 { B1/10/2 }).  \n103. In terms of the decisions to grant the Relevant  and Intermediary Loans, again Mr \nBogolyubov had no involvement. It was the Credit Committee (which had authority to \nAA4/1/40\n \n37 \n approve lending of different levels38) that approved these loans. They were not even referred \nto the Supervisory Board: rather , the Credit Com mittee cards and minutes specified that the \nloan documentation could be approved by individuals such as Mr Dubilet, Ms Gurieva, \nYuriy Pikush  (Deputy Chairman of the Management Board)  and Aleksey Ponomarev  (Head \nof Client Lending , BOK) : see e.g.  {E2/174 } {E2/175} {E1/251 } {E4/182 } {E5/152} . It \nwas in fact generally Mr Dubilet who signed the relevant agreements in resp ect of the \nUkrainian loans and Mr Morgachev who "}

It \nwas in fact generally Mr Dubilet who signed the relevant agreements in resp ect of the \nUkrainian loans and Mr Morgachev who signed the Cypriot agreements: Shekmar 1/32 \n{B1/12/10 }. \n104. The evidence o f the Bank’s factual witnesses who worked at the Bank at the time is \nconsistent with it being Mr Dubilet  (assisted by other Bank executives)  who took the key \ndecisions: Lozytska1/15 {B1/6/5 }, Luchaninov1/11, 14, 43- 45 {B1/3/4 }. None of the \nwitnesses give any evidence of M r Bogolyubov’s involvement in management, save for \nstating that they “ assumed at the time ” that Mr Dubilet, Ms Gurieva and other senior managers \nof the Bank “ would have had close relationships with the former shareholders ”: Lozytska1/15 \n{B1/6/5 }, or “ would have received instructions directly from the Bank’s former owners ”: \nLuchaninov1/14, 17 {B1/3/5 }. No basis is provided for these supposed assumptions, \nwhich, even if truly held, are irrelevant and should be ignored.  \n105. There is therefore no evidence during this period that Mr Bogolyubov was linked, in any \ncapacity, to any of the relevant borro wing or other aspects of the “Scheme” . The absence \nof such evidence is particularly notable where there is  evidence that Mr Bogolyubov was \nasked ( e.g. by Mr Dubilet or Mr Novikov) to take decisions about his own assets as a \ncustomer of the Bank. e.g.  {E1/259} {E1/260 } {E2/42} {E2/197 } {E2/198 } {E1/143 } \n{E1/273} .  \n106. Insofar as the Bank relies  on Mr Bogolyubov’s indirect interest in  some of  the Relevant  or \nIntermediary  Borrowers , there is no evidence that he was  ever told of the  relevant  activities \nof those borrowers, still less that he was asked to authorise any transactions.  He also had a \nvery limited role in approving the Bank’s related parties lists: see further Section C5 below.  \n \n38 The relative levels of authority of the various Credit Committees are shown at  {E4/75}  {E4/128} {E7/117 }  \nAA4/1/41\n \n38 \n (2) Shift in his role from July 2014  \n107. On around 1.7.14, Mr Bogolyubov agreed with Mr Kolomoisky that he would from that \ndate vote his shares and act as Chairman of the Supervisory Board at Mr Kolomoisky’s sole \ndirection.  \n108. This step -change in Mr Bogolyubov’s role manifested itself in his even more limited \ninvolvement in the management of the Bank and in his lack of significant participation in discussions and negotiations with the NBU. Yet it had no impact on the alleged “Scheme” , \nwhich carried on just as before: see Section B2  above.  \n(i) The Deeds of Indemnity and Waiver  \n109. The agreement between Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Kolomoisky was recorded in May/June \n2015, in a number of English law deeds of indemnity and waiver signed by Mr Bogolyubov (on the one hand) and Mr Kolomoisky { E9/172L/5 }\n39 {E10/28 }, Mr D ubilet {E10/91 }, \nMr Novikov { E9/259} and Triantal Investments ( a minority  shareholder in the Bank)  \n{E7/182}  (on the other)  (the Deeds of Indemnity and Waiver ).  \n110. Mr Kolomoisky signed a deed of indemnity  on 12.5.15 { E9/172L/5 } and a deed of waiver \non 12.6.15 { E10/28} . These record  his agreement with Mr Bogolyubov that:  \n110.1  from 1.7.14, Mr Bogolyubov would vote his shares and act as Chairman of the Supervisory Board “ at the sole direction of ” Mr Kolomoisky  (and had been doing so \nsince that date) { E9/172L/ 5-6} (Recitals and clause 2.1) ;  \n110.2  from that date, and “ [d]espite remain ing a shareholder of PrivatBank and in the position of \nChairman for the time being ” Mr Bogolyubov “ no longer exercises any management control over \nPrivatBank de facto  even though he continues to do"}

The three other deeds of waiver also record that Mr Bogolyubov had, since 1.7.14, been \nexercising his voting rights and Supervisory Board duties at the sole direction of Mr \nKolomoisky. Mr Dubilet, Mr Novikov and Triantal also agreed to waive and release Mr \nBogolyubov from any and all liabilities arising as a result of his shareholding or \nChairmanship from 1.7.14 until the date on which he ceased to be a shareholder.  \n112. On two occasions, Mr Kolomoisky formally wrote to Mr Bogolyubov pursuant to the Deed \nof Waiver asking him to take certain steps: { E13/99 } {E15/272} . \n113. The Bank has served a notice  to prove in respect of the authenticity of the Deeds of \nIndemnity and Waiver and Mr Kolomoisky’s letter s to Mr Bogolyubov  {B5/2 }. An \nequivalent  draft deed of waiver between the Bank and Mr Bogolyubov (ultimately not \nexecuted) was  demonstrably in circulation attached to emails in May 2015 {E9/214.5 } \n{E9/214.6}  {E9/214.7} . In addition, Mr Bogolyubov has provided email s (redacted for \nlegal professional privilege) attaching unsigned execution versions of the Deeds of \nIndemnity and Waiver  and metadata showing that these emails and their attachments were \nsent on 12.5.15 and 26.5.15: see for the 12.5.15 email {E9/191.1} {E9/19 1.4L} {E9/191.5} \nand the 26.5.15 email {E9/247.1} {E9/247.2} {E9/247.3} {E9/247.4} {E9/247.5} \n{E9/247.6}  and the metadata {L/159 .01} {L/159.1 }. At any rate , it is clear that from 1.7.14, \nMr Bogolyubov’s  role in the B ank was  as a matter of fact  purely nominal . \n(ii) Mr Bogolyubov’s diminished role at the Bank  \n114. Between 1.7.14 and Nationalisation, Mr Bogolyubov’s role in the Bank was purely formal. \nNearly all of the  communications (e.g. letters, emails and IM chats) in the trial bundl e in this \nperiod to which Mr Bogolyubov was a party  are concerned either with his own business  or \n \n40  Defined at { E9/172L/5 } as “any investigation, demand claim, action or proceeding, brought or threatened against [D2] \narising in connec tion with [D2’s] position as Chairman and/or shareholder [of the Bank] (including in respect of [D2’s] own \nnegligence, gross negligence, fraudulent or otherwise unlawful acts of [D2])…”. \nAA4/1/43\n \n40 \n personal  interests or were formal letters to the NBU sent at Mr Kolomoisky’s direction (as \nto which see below).  \n115.

{"start": 105000, "text": "ing in connec tion with [D2’s] position as Chairman and/or shareholder [of the Bank] (including in respect of [D2’s] own \nnegligence, gross negligence, fraudulent or otherwise unlawful acts of [D2])…”. \nAA4/1/43\n \n40 \n personal  interests or were formal letters to the NBU sent at Mr Kolomoisky’s direction (as \nto which see below).  \n115. Although he continued to sit on the Supervisor y Board, Mr Bogolyubov resigned as \nChairman in late April 2015 and was replaced on 1.5.15 by Volodymyr Stelmakh (a former \nhead of the NBU) { E9/95/35- 36} {E9/258} .41 The weight of his vote was also in practice \nreduced: Mr Kolomoisky began to vote on the Supervisory Board from May 2015 and all \nfive members from June 2015 { K1/98 } {K1/102 }. The Supervisory Board did not meet in \nperson, the minutes from May 2015 recording that the meetings were in the form  of “absentee \nvoting ” e.g. { K1/99 } {K1/100 }. \n116. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board was still not being informed by the management of the risks being taken by the Bank. The NBU concluded in its inspection report covering the period 1.5.14 –  1.1.16 that the Supervisory Board did not exercise control over the Bank’s \nactivities, including the work of the Management Board: “ the Supervisory Board is not informed \nof risks that threaten the financia l banks status. Interaction between the Supervisory Board and Management \nBoard, in terms of management and control over the activities of the institution is not effective ” {E15/28}  \n(pp.6, 18, 22)  {E15/29/46} {E15/33/ 16}. \n117. Mr Bogolyubov’s lack of involvement in the Bank is also evidenced by a letter sent by the Bank’s new management to Mr Kolomoisky post -Nationalisation (on 27.3.17) stating “ You \nare the person who participated in the management of PJSC CB PRIVATBANK (hereinafter - the Bank) \nuntil 20 December 2016. Ma ny managerial decisions were made directly by you or with your approval and \nknowledge. ” {E17/149 }.  \n(iii) Role in discussions with the NBU  \n118. Throughout this period, the Bank  was involved in discussions with the NBU. These included \nrequests by the Bank for stabilisation loans, negotiations of amendments to NBU loan repayment schedules, discussions of the results of NBU audits, negotiations of additional \ncapital contributions t o the Bank and, ultimately, negotiations of the Restructuring and \nTransformation, leading to Nationalisation.  \n119. Mr Bogolyubov had very little involvement in these matters, generally limited to being kept \nupdated by Mr Dubilet and Mr Kolomoisky and signing f ormal letters to the NBU.  \n \n41  This is agreed: Chronology { AA1/4/12 } \nAA4/1/44\n \n41 \n 120. It was Mr Kolomoisky and the Bank’s management (in particular Mr Dubilet) who took the \nlead. For example:   \n120.1  Kateryna Rozhkova  (then -Acting Deputy Governor of the NBU)  explains in her \nevidence that she regularly met and dealt with Mr Kolomoisky (as well as Bank \nexecutives such as Mr Dubilet and Lyudmila Shmalchenko  (Deputy Chair of the \nManagement Board, Director of the Treasury Department) ) in relation to \nrestructuring of the NBU refinancing loans, the results of the stress test, th e \nproduction of restructuring and recapitalisation plans and the Transformation (in which Mr Kolomoisky was “ deeply involved ”). See e.g.  Rozhkova 1/136, 145, 147, 153-\n7, 174, 176- 181, 187, 193, 198, 204- 13, 229 {B1/5 }; and \n \n120.2  Mr Kolomoisky communicated on a semi -regular basis with Ms Rozhkova and \nValeria Gontareva (then -Governor of the NBU)  by WhatsApp:  {K5-A1/54 } {K5 -\nA1/55 } {K5 -A1/22 }. \n121. By contrast, Mr Bogolyubov did not meet or communicate with eith er Ms Rozhkova or Ms \nGontareva prior to September 2016: Rozhkova1/181, 198 { B1/5/46 }. His role was \ngenerally limited to signing documents, as follows:  \n121.1  he signed documents  as necessary in relation to NBU stabilisation loans e.g.  a request \nfor a loan on 17.7.14 { E4/255} , an NBU loan repayment schedule under a  loan \nagreement on 2.10.14 {"}

By contrast, Mr Bogolyubov did not meet or communicate with eith er Ms Rozhkova or Ms \nGontareva prior to September 2016: Rozhkova1/181, 198 { B1/5/46 }. His role was \ngenerally limited to signing documents, as follows:  \n121.1  he signed documents  as necessary in relation to NBU stabilisation loans e.g.  a request \nfor a loan on 17.7.14 { E4/255} , an NBU loan repayment schedule under a  loan \nagreement on 2.10.14 {E5/309} and various amendments to NBU loan repayment \nschedule s {E18/205 } {E18/206} {E18/207} {E18/208} {E18/209} ; \n121.2  Mr Bogolyubov signed a letter to the NBU concerning the recovery plan. This followed a letter from Mr Kolomoisky on 27.9.16, directing Mr Bogolyubov pursuant to the Deed of Waiver to sign { E15/272} . The draft letter had been agreed in \nadvance between Mr Kolomoisky and Ms Rozhkova: { K5-A1/54/4 -8} {E15/283} \n{E15/309} . Mr Bogolyubov signed the letter after meeting with the NBU:  \n{E15/300}  {E15/301 } {K5-A1/55/3 }; and  \n121.3  on 16.12.16, Mr Bogolyubov signed a letter to Volodymyr Groysman ( then-Prime \nMinister  of Ukraine), agreed between Mr Kolomoisky and the President , agreeing to \nthe nationalisation of the Bank { E17/42} .  \n122. Ms Rozhkova’s gratuitous  references to her “ assumptions ” that Mr Bogoly ubov was otherwise \ninvolved in the process or to Mr Kolomoisky supposedly saying Mr Bogolyubov would need \nAA4/1/45\n \n42 \n to be consulted (e.g. Rozhkova 1/181, 198) {B1/5/49 } have no weight in the face of the \nclear evidence to the contrary.42 \n(iv) Role in the Bank’s recovery process  \n123. Mr Bogolyubov’s role generally in the Bank’s recovery process  and its recapitalisation was \nlimited, consistent with his reduced role. This is particularly apparent when contrasted with \nMr Kolomoisky’s , e.g.: \n123.1  in February 2015, Mr Kolomoisky assigned a substantial amount of debt to the Bank \n{E13/27} ; \n123.2  in March 2015, Mr Kolomoisky provided personal guarantees for the stabilisation \nloan granted by the NBU to the Bank:  {E8/146 } {E17/159/10 }; \n123.3  in June 2015, Mr Kolomoisky contributed capital to the Bank {K6/82} ; \n123.4  in early 2016, Mr Kolomoisky committed to the NBU to contribute additional equity capital to the Bank over the  coming years to ensure the Bank’s compliance with the \nregulatory capital adequacy ratios { E12/209}  {E12/231 } {E12/256 }; and  \n123.5  in July 2016, Mr Kolomoisky gave a personal guarantee that the Bank would meet its \nundertakings to the NBU and complete the restructuring process: {E14/322} . \n124. By contrast, whilst Mr Bogolyubov agreed to contribute some assets and (indirectly) some \nmoney to shore up the Bank’s balance sheet and signed the September 2016 letter to the NBU, he did not otherwise provide any personal guarantees or undertakings to the  NBU.  \n(3) Post-Nationalisation   \n125. Mr Bogolyubov’s conduct and relationships post -Nationalisation  do not provide any reliable \nbasis for inferring that he was culpably involved in the pre -Nationalisation  conduct \ncomplained of by the Bank. Moreover, h is post -Nation alisation conduct falls to be assessed \nin circumstances where his Ukrainian property interests remained  in complex structures \nmanaged on his behalf (including assets inextricably bound up with those of Mr \n \n42 As to the Bank’s other NBU witnesses: (i) Ruslana  Domashenko (who acted as curator of the Bank for the \nNBU from February 2015)  states in h er evid ence that she never met or had dealings with either Mr Kolomoisky \nor Mr Bogolyubov: Domashenko 1/14 { B1/14/5 }; (ii) Mykhailo Shekmar (who led the NBU’s unscheduled \ninspection at the Bank from 17.10.16 to end December 2016) does not mention having had any dealings with \neither Mr Kolomoisky or Mr Bogolyubov { B1/12 }. \nAA4/1/46\n \n43 \n Kolomoisky ) and where the Deeds of Indemnity and Waiver, which remained in force , \ncovered the last 2  ½ years of his time as a shareholder o"}

MR BOGOLYUBOV ’S APPROACH TO HIS ASSETS  \n126. Mr Bogolyubov had interests in a number of industries, such as mining (e.g. Consolidated \nMinerals Ltd.), oil & gas (e.g. Ukrnafta), ferroalloys (e.g. ZFZ, SFZ, Nikopol) a s well as \nvarious real estate  interests : see e.g. the lists of his interests at { E1/85 } (as at March 2011) \n{E18/235.3 }. The majority of communications in the bundle concerning Mr Bogolyubov \nrelate to such assets.  \n127. Three key points are apparent from the documents:  \n127.1  first, Mr Bogolyubov’s tangible assets were (and  continue to be) held through \ncomplex and generally multi -tiered structures;  \n127.2  secondly, these structures were created and managed on his behalf; and  \n127.3  thirdly, he was not generally aware (and thus had to be informed as necessary) of the \nidentity of the corporate vehicles through which his tangible assets were held, and in \nwhich he technically held interests.  \n128. As to the first and second points, Mr Bogolyubov’s assets were structured and managed with \nthe assistance of the Bank, Primecap and various corporate s ervice providers (“ CSPs ”), \nwhich provided corporate administration services to companies owned by trusts of which Mr Bogolyubov was a discretionary beneficiary. As well as being assisted generally by the \nBank in the structuring and management of his assets  (e.g. sending him budgets to sign: \n{E1/82 } {E1/83 } {E1/183 } {E1/184 }), Mr Bogolyubov w as assisted by : \n128.1  Vyacheslav (Slava) Anischenko, who assisted in overseeing Mr Bogolyubov’s \npersonal investments located outside Ukraine  as well as assets such as his private jet. \nIt is not said that Mr Anischenko had anything to do with the “Scheme”  and \naccordingly it is unclear why the Bank seeks to criticise Mr Bogolyubov for not calling \nhim (a suggestion which has not previously been made) : Bank Opening/78 -81 \n{AA2/1/40 }; and  \n128.2  Timur Novikov (Head of the Bank’s Investment Business, Deputy Chair of the \nManagement Board and shareholder  of Primecap ).  \nAA4/1/47\n \n44 \n 128.3  Mr Bogolyubov dealt with Mr Anis chenko and Mr Novikov in relation to high level \nstrategic decisions relating to his assets and , where necessary , to sign documents such \nas budgets and beneficiary instructions (see e.g.s below). Mr Anischenko in turn dealt \nwith Primecap and Andreas Marangos (of the CSP Marangos & Hadjipapa) e .g. \n{E3/315} {E10/95}  {E12/12 } {E12/215 }. \n129. As the Bank itself points out  (Bank Opening/90)  {AA2/1/44 }, the complex way in which \nMr Bogolyubov’s assets were structured was long -standing and significantly pre -dated the \nalleged “Scheme” : see the spreadsheets showing the structures of asset holdings in 2007/ \n2008 {E1/29 } {E1/11 } {E1/12 }. It cannot be said that the means of structuring his assets \nwas put in place to disguise or permit  the alleged “fraud”.  \n130. As to the third point, the documents clearly show that Mr Bogolyubov dealt with his \ninvestments by reference to the underlying tangible asset and  needed to be informed if \nrelevant of how his holding in that asset had been structured,  e.g.: \n130.1  On 27.10.11, Mr Novikov emailed him with details of “ Croatia Hotels – Expenses ” \n{E1/116 }. \n130.2  On 21.3.12, Mr Novikov e mailed him asking if he wanted to take part in a \nprivatisation tender for another Croatian hotel { E1/143 }.  \n130.3  On 30.7.12, Mr Novikov sent Mr Bogolyubov a presentation on potential \nrestructuring of the “ Optima Group ” "}

MR BOGOLYUBOV ’S RELATIONSHIP WITH MR KOLOMOISKY  \n131. The Bank regularly conflates the position of Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Kolomoisky, \npresumably in order to obnubilate the fact that the majority of the factual evidence upon \nwhich it seeks to rely relates to Mr Kolomoisky alone. Particularly egregious examples arise in relation to  control of the Borrowers and D 3-8, the Bank often s aying that factors or \nevidence relates to “D1 -2” whereas on closer inspection the evidence relates only to D1.  \n132. This conflation is not legitimate. Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Kolomoisky had a long -standing \nfriendship and business relationship, sometimes investing alongside one another ( e.g., in \nUkrnafta and Nikopol); however, they  were not business “partners” in any legal sense and \nacted  independently.  \n133. Accordingly, Mr Kolomoisky’s acts cannot be treated as Mr Bogolyubov’s. The highest it can perhaps be put is that Mr Bogolyubov sometimes deferred to Mr Kolomoisky and was \ncontent to let him deal with aspects of their shared businesses.  \n134. Ultimately, their friendship, and evidence of shared ownership, whether in respect of the \nBank or other assets, is irrelevant to the matters in issue in this case. In particular, this is \nirrelevant to the questions of control dealt with in the next section.  \nC5. F\nACTORS RELIED UPON BY THE BANK  \n135. In substance, the Bank suggests that it should be inferred that Mr Bogolyubov was involved \nin the “Scheme”  from a number of factors, in turn to be inferred from circumstantial \nevidence. The key factors are (i) Mr Bogolyubo v’s and Mr Kolomoisky’s alleged control of \nthe Bank; and (ii) their alleged control of the Borrowers, Intermediary Borrowers, New \nBorrowers and Defendant Suppliers.  \n136. In significant part, the Bank’s case is circular and is a prime example of the type of cas e \ncautioned against by Cockerill J in King v Stiefel, in that it seeks to build inferences upon other inferences or assumptions of dishonesty.  \nAA4/1/49\n \n46 \n 137. For example, the Bank relies upon Mr Bogolyubov’s alleged control of the Borrowers for \nhis involvement in the “S cheme” .

For example, the Bank relies upon Mr Bogolyubov’s alleged control of the Borrowers for \nhis involvement in the “S cheme” . In turn, the Bank says it should be inferred that the \nBorrowers were ultimately owned and/or controlled by Mr Bogolyubov and Mr \nKolomoisky, inter alia on the basis that the Relevant Loans were (purportedly) repaid by \nloans to Borrowers and further companies ultimately owned and/or controlled Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Kolomoisky. Yet:  \n137.1  insofar as the Bank relies upon the repayment of the Relevant Loans by Borrowers \n(allegedly controlled by Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov) to establish that Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov controlled the Borrowers, this is wholly circular;  \n137.2  insofar as the Bank relies upon the Relevant Loans being repaid by loans to the \nIntermediary Borrowers to establish control, it must establish that the Intermediary Borrowers are owned and /or controlled by Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Kolomoisky. \nHowever:  \ni) one of the factors relied upon by the Bank for Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Kolomoisky’s alleged control of the Intermediary Borrowers is that these \nborrowers were used in the same way as the Borrowers.\n43 This factor presumes \nthat Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Kolomoisky’s control of the Borrowers has been established. The reasoning is thus circular;  \nii) a further factor relied upon by the Bank is that nearly  all of the Intermediary \nLoans were repaid by the New Borro wers (which it says were owned and/or \ncontrolled by Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Kolomoisky).\n44 Yet the Bank’s case that \nthe New Borrowers were owned and/or controlled by Mr Bogolyubov and Mr \nKolomoisky is in turn to be inferred from the factors summarised at Repl y/31-\n32 {A1/25/61 }. One of the se factors is that the New Borrowers used the New \nLoans to repay the Relevant Loans and Intermediary Loans  (i.e. loans to \ncompanies allegedly owned and/or controlled by Mr Bogolyubov and Mr \nKolomoisky) . Once again, this is circular.  \n \n43 Bank’s Amended Response to D2’s RFI dated 24.3.20, ¶36(b)(i) {A2/4/34}  \n44 Ibid, ¶36(b)(iii)  \nAA4/1/50\n \n47 \n 138. The Bank has prioritised quantity over quality, relying  upon a panoply of factors and \nassertions as the basis for the inferences it seeks to draw. As demonstrated below, the \nevidential basis relied upon by the Bank is tenuous and weak.  \n139. It is noted that in some respects the Bank’s case as set out in opening relies upon different \nfactors for Mr Bogolyubov's alleged dishonesty than its pleaded case. This shift in position \nis inappropriate and Mr Bogolyubov objects to the Bank’s attem pt to rely upon new factors. \nClaimants are obliged to plead full particulars of allegations of fraud or dishonesty and must \nset out in their pleadings the facts on the basis of which any inferences are alleged (Chancery \nGuide, ¶4.8). The shifts in the Bank’s case are noted below.  \n(1) Mr Bogolyubov did not control the Bank or its “significant decisions”   \n140. A key element of the Bank’s case is its claim that Mr Bogolyubov together with Mr \nKolomoisky “ controlled all significant decisions made by the Bank”, including “ all significant corporate \nlending decisions ”. It pleads that  the source s of this control were : (i) their direct and indirect \nownership of up to 98% of the shares in the Bank; (ii) their positions on the Supervisory Board; and (iii) their “ reputations as a ggressive businessmen ”. The Bank claims that its executives \nand employees acted in accordance with their direct and indirect instructions.\n45 In Opening, \nthe Bank also alleges that Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Kolomoisky in fact exercised control over \nthe Managemen t Board and the departments of the Bank allegedly involved in the \nMisappropriation, in particular BOK and the Investment Busine"}

Once again, the Bank’s case is let down by a lack of evidence:  \n141.1  Mr Bogolyubov’s shareholding : There is no evidence of Mr Bogolyubov voting his \nshareholding to control any of the types of “ significant decisions ” relied upon by the \nBank. Further, nothing can be inferred from the mere mathematical sum of Mr \nBogolyubov’s and Mr Kolomoisky’s shares. Mr Bogolyubov’s interest in the Bank \nfluctuated between 41.58% and 46.66% between 31.12.10 and the Bank’s \nnationalisation. Mr Kolomoisky’s fluctuated between 40  and 50%. It is not alleged \nthat there was any agreement between Mr Bogo lyubov and Mr Kolomoisky (other \nthan the indemnity described above) as to how their shares should be held or used.47 \n \n45  RRRRAPOC/14 {A1/2/6 } \n46  Bank Opening, Section D  {AA2/1/50 }.  \n47  c.f. Bank’s Opening/101 -102 {AA2/1/50 } \nAA4/1/51\n \n48 \n Nor is suggested that any decision taken by the shareholders was related to the \n“Scheme ”. Any shareholder approvals for the appointment of senior executives \nsignificantly pre -date the “ Scheme ”. \n141.2  Mr Bogolyubov’s position on the Supervisory Board: As explained above, there is \nno evidence that Mr Bogolyubov exercised control over any relevant decisions in this \ncapacity. Further, from 1.7.14, he e xercised his duties on the Supervisory Board at \nMr Kolomoisky’s direction.  \n141.3  Mr Bogolyubov’s reputation: The reliance on Mr Bogolyubov ’s alleged reputation as \nan “aggressive businessman ” (whatever this means) is devoid of significance.48 The \nBank’s suggesti on that there was no prospect that Bank employees would do \nanything other than “ implement D1-2's instructions” is let down by the fact that there is \nno evidence of Mr Bogolyubov giving  any such instructions  (and the Bank’s \nwitnesses give no evidence, beyon d assumption, that he was actually involved).    \n142. There is a gulf, which there is  no attempt to bridge, between Mr Bogolyubov holding formal \npositions at the Bank and in fact  controlling the Bank. If Mr Bogolyubov did, in fact, control \nthe Bank and if, in fact, the employees “ acted in accordance with [his] direct [or] indirect \ninstructions ”49 in relation to the Bank’s business, there would be evidence  of those \ninstructions . There is none.  \n143. As to the particular categories of “ significant decisions ” the Bank says Mr Bogolyubov \ncontrolled (listed in its RRFI of 30.7.21, ¶¶1- 3) {A2/19/2 -4}, there is  evidence showing who \ntook these decisions, as set out in the below table. It was not Mr Bogolyubov. Rather, in accordance with practice and Ukrainian law, the responsibility for the Bank’s significan t \ndecisions was entrusted to its Management Board { C1/211/16 } (¶9.4), Beketov 8/312- 316, \n323 {C1/1/10 0-101} {C1/1/106},  Alyoshin  2/312 { C7/1/101 }. \n \n48  Bank Openings/103  {AA2/1/50 -51} \n49  RRRRAPOC/14 {A1/2/6 } \nAA4/1/52\n \n49 \n Table 1 : Bank’s “ significant decisions ” alleged ly controlled by Mr Bogolyubov and Mr \nKolomoisky  \nBank’s “ significant \ndecisions ”50 What the evidence in fact shows  \n(1) Decisions in relation to \nlending by the Bank, e.g. : \n“to grant the Relevant \nLoans…without any valid security ” \n“to grant the Intermediary \nLoans…for the purpose of \ndisguising the Misappropriation ” \n“to grant loans to related parties \nexceeding US$500,000 in value \nwithout a special resolution of the \nSupervisory Board…and/or on \npreferential terms ” \n“to grant loans to entities owned an d"}

Rather, the Credit Committee and Management Board  \napproved the loans and the \ncollateral to be provided (which was s tated on the \nCredit Committee cards and loan agreements e.g. \n{E2/174} {F2/21 }). That the Credit Committee and \nnot the Supervisory Board approved the loans is \ncommon ground: Bank Opening/202  {AA2/1/93 }. \nThere is a single example in the trial bundle of the \nSupervisory Board ostensibly approving a (non-\nrelevant) related party loan  to MoskomPrivatBank in \nthe Relevant Period  {K1/31 }. \n(b) The Credit Committee cards for  the Relevant and \nIntermediary Loans specified  that members of the \nManagement Board were competent to appr ove the \nloan documents.

See \nsimilarly {K6/23}  in November 2013.  \n(2) Decisions in relation to \ndisclosure of the Bank’s \nrelated parties, namely \ndecisions “ to add or remove \nentities or individuals from the \nBank’s related party lists” and “not \nto disclose to the NBU and/o r the \nBank’s auditors that counterparties \nto transactions with the Bank were owned and/or controlled by D1 -2”. \n (a) The Bank produced two types of related party lists: (i) lists for the NBU; and (ii) IFRS lists for the Bank’s \nauditors.  \n(b) The NBU lists:  \ni. From Oc tober 2013, the compliance department \nwas responsible for compiling the NBU lists. \nPreviously, the Investment Business was \nresponsible: Luchaninov1/39 -40 {B1/3/9 }. \nii. The process was that the lists were compiled by the \ncompliance department with input from the Bank’s \nother divisions.

According to Mr Luchaninov, the Investment \nBusiness was responsible for the IFRS lists \nthroughout the relevant period (Luchaninov1/39 -\n40) { B1/3/9 }.  \nii. Decisions on who was to be included in the list \nwere taken by the Bank’s management (e.g. \n{E3/200} { E10/223} { E10/249} {E14/20 } \n{E14/66} ). The lists were then approved by Mr \nDubile t as Chairman of the Management Board.  \niii. There is no evidence that Mr Bogolyubov was \ninvolved in taking decisions as to the compiling or \napproval of the lists. His name does not appear in \nthe list of individuals responsible for approval: see e.g. {\nK3-E/21 } {K3 -E/53 }. Rather, his only input \nappears to have been signing shareholder \nrepresentation letters confirming the lists provided to him in the context of the Bank’s audits by PwC. It appears that he relied upon the lists having been compile d correctly by the Bank, e.g.  in December \n2012, Mr Novikov sent Mr Bogolyubov a list for signature saying it “ has been reviewed by Privatbank” \n{\nE1/229} {E1/333 }.  \n(d) The Supervisory Board was not involved in the \ncompilation or approval of the related party lists, albeit \nit did approve the Bank’s internal procedures for \nforming the lists e.g. { K1/181 }. \n(e) The lists were produced regularly (the NBU lists every \nquarter from 2014 and every month from May 2015: \nAA4/1/55\n \n52 \n Luchaninov1/23 {B1/3/ 7}, the IFRS lists every three \nmonths: see  bundle  K3-E). If Mr Bogolyubov had been \ninvolved, there would be a record of this.  \n(3) Decisions to accept the \nRelevant Loan Transferr ed \nAssets at the valuations stated \nin {A2/22 } and as valid \nrepayment of drawdowns \nunder the Relevant Loans.  (a) Mr Bogolyubov agreed in broad terms that some of his \nassets could be used by the Bank to shore up its balance \nsheet  (see e.g. { E14/303.1 } {E14/303.2} ).  \n(b) However,  he was involved in the Bank’s  decision to \naccept the RLTAs only as part of the five -member \nSupervisory Board which gave consent on 28.3.16 to the Management Board recognising  certain  property \n(including some of the RLTAs ) onto the Bank’s balance \nsheet tow ards repayment of b\norrowers’ debts \n{A2/31.3 } {A2/31.4 }. The list of assets approved by \nthe Supervisory Board contained “ independent expert \nvaluation ” figures but contained a blank column for the \nvaluations to be accepted on the Bank’s balance sheet). \nThis resolution post -dated his 1.7.14 agreement with Mr \nKolomoisky and his resignation as Chairman of the \nSupervisory Board ( by this time chaired by Mr \nStelmakh) . \n(c) There is no evidence that Mr Bogolyubov was \notherwise involved in the Bank’s decisions as to what \nassets should be accepted or how they should be valued.  \n(4) Decisions in relation to the \nTransformation and New \nLoans, namely (i) “ decisions \nrequired to devise and implement the Transformation\n” and (ii) the \n“decision to terminate the Sha re \nPledges on or about 12 October \n2016”.  (a) As explained above, Mr Bogolyubov’s involvement in the Transformation was limited to signing off on a letter \nto Ms Roz hkova of October  \n2016 (agreed in draft \nbetween Ms Rozhkova and Mr Kolomoisky) proposing \na “restructuring of the corporate credit portfolio ”. Mr \nKolomoisky and the Bank’s management devised the \nTransformation, in conjunction with the NBU e.g. \n{E16/23.2 } {E16/24} { E16/25}  {E16/28} .  \nAA4/1/56\n \n53 \n (b) There is no evidence that Mr Bogolyubov was involved \nin any decision to cancel the Share Pledges.

(a) As explained above, there is no evidence that Mr \nBogolyubov was involved in any “Scheme” . However, \nthere is a documentary trail recording the acts which the Bank says comprise its alleged “Scheme” : see Section \nB2 above.  \n(b) It is unclear if the Bank in its Opening/156 \n{AA2/1/70 } alleges that, by reason of relying upon the \nLafferty Spreadsheets in interlocutory proceedings , Mr \nBogolyubov a ccepted that he could provide an \nexplanation for the “Scheme” . If this is what is \nsuggested, it is incorrect . Mr Bogolyubov  referred to \nand relied upon Mr Kolomoisky’s evidence (including \nthe Lafferty Spreadsheets) for a limited purpose in \nrelation to cert ain interlocutory applications (in relation \nto jurisdiction and the WFO). No admissions were \nthereby made as to Mr B ogolyubov ’s knowledge of the \n“Scheme” , or indeed as to Mr Kolomoisky’s. See e.g. \nMr Bogolyubov’s evidence in support of that \napplication {H3/3/2 } (¶3) and his skeleton {G2/23/2}  \n(¶¶4 and 6).  \n144. There is also evidence suggesting that neither Bank employees nor the NBU considered that Mr Bogoly ubov controlled the Bank. For example , in the lists of additional  related parties \nsent by the NBU to the Bank in 2015 and 2016, the NBU did not identify any parties as being related to the Bank under criterion code 521 (“ Bank controllers”): see e.g.  {E10/266} \n{E17/36} . Rather, Messrs Bogolyubov and Kolomoisky were identified by the NBU in the \nrelated party list under criterion code 522 (“ parties with a major shareholding in the bank ”) \n{E17/36/8}  {E17/36/12} . \nAA4/1/57\n \n54 \n (2) Mr Bogolyubov did not control the Management Board  \n145. It is not the case, as the Bank would have it, that Mr Bogolyubov “ controlled ” the Management \nBoard  and there is no evidence of Mr  Bogolyubov giving instructions to the Management \nBoard in relation to the management of the Bank, let alone the alleged “Scheme” .  \n146. As to Mr Dubilet, the documents show that, on the limited occasions where Mr Bogolyubov \nwas involved by Mr Dubilet in Bank m atters, this was merely to be informed of matters or \nasked to approve decisions that had already been made: e.g. {E1/275} {E3/168.1 }. As to the \nmatters relied upon at Bank Opening/119 -120 { AA2/1/56 }: \n146.1  Mr Dubilet and Mr Bogolyubov did correspond occasionally in relation to Mr \nBogolyubov’s own assets e.g. , {E1/259} {E2/190 }. This shows nothing about Mr \nBogolyubov’s “control” of the Management Board. He was  a client of the Bank.  \n146.2  The Bank is incorrect to suggest that Mr Bogolyubov “instructed” Mr Dubilet in relation to new business opportunities for the Bank. The two emails relied upon by \nthe Bank { E8/75}  {E15/131.1 } (and its attachment { E15/131.2 }) simply show Mr \nBogolyubov forwarding on proposals he had received from third parties.  \n146.3  A query from Mr Bogolyubov to Mr Dubilet asking “ what should be done”  in relation \nto an outstanding loan to Hotel Split { E15/132.1 } does not show Mr Bogolyubov \n“controlling” Mr Dubilet.  \n146.4  The Bank’s reliance upon messages about Mr Dubilet’s bir thday and health tips is \nembarrassing and can be discounted.  \n146.5  The fact that Mr Bogolyubov spoke relatively regularly to Mr Dubilet in the first"}

As to Ms Gurieva, Ms Chmona, Mr Yatsenko and Mr Pikush, none of the documents relied upon by the Bank (Bank Opening/121 -130) {AA2/1/57 } concern the management of the \nBank or even evidence communications between the relevant individual and Mr \nBogol yubov .51 \n \n51  The Bank’s submissions in relation to Mr Gorokhovsky (Bank Opening/131)  {AA2/1/61}  appear to apply \nonly to D1.  \nAA4/1/58\n \n55 \n 148. There is also no evidence to support  the Bank’s new allegation that these individuals were \ngiven shares in the Bank as a “quid pro quo” (presumably for being allegedly “controlled” \nby Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov) . The fact these individuals held shares in the Bank \nis consistent with  the Bank’s  long -standing  management incentive scheme  {E1/255/201 }.   \n149. The Bank ’s suggestion  that “secret ive” departments in the Bank, including BOK and the \nInvestment Business, were set up to service Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Kolomoisky’s \ncompanies (Bank Opening/5(1))  {AA2/1/10 } is equally unfounded. I t can be undermined \nby the Bank’s own evidence, which shows that BOK continues to exist at the Bank under a \ndifferent name (NURA): Lozytska/11 {B1/6/4 }.  \n150. If the Bank cannot show that Mr Bogolyubov in fact controlled the relevant decisions at the Bank, its case against him falls apart.  \n(3) Mr Bogolyubov did not control the Borrowers, Intermediary Borrowers, New \nBorrowers or Defendant Suppliers\n52  \n151. The Bank defines “ control ” as “the ability, directly or indirectly, to determine the decisions and/or actions \ntaken by the Borrowers/ Defendant Suppliers ” {A2/4/4 }.  \n152. Mr Bogolyubov has admitted having technical (and generally very small) indirect interests in \nsome of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers.  Insofar as these ent ities had historically \nheld assets in which Mr Bogolyubov had an interest , he gave directions in connection with \nthose  assets.  By contrast , there is no evidence that he controlled any of the Borrowers, \nIntermediary Borrowers, New Borrowers or Defendant Sup pliers  or that he knew or  \ndetermine d, directly or indirectly, the relevant decisions and/or actions that they took.  \n153. As a result of the lack of actual evidence, the Bank has resorted to putting together complex and convoluted “charts” to try to suggest tha t Mr Bogolyubov controlled these companies \non the basis of a mosaic of connections between him and numerous other individuals and \nentities.  \n \n52  There are errors in Schedules 6 and 7 to the Bank’s Opening (purporting to set out Mr Bogolyubov’s admitted \ninterests in the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers and details of nominees).

The relevant \nquestion is whether or not in fact  he had or exercised any control over them  at all or in \nrelation to any trans actions said to form part of the “Scheme” .   \n156. In the trial bundle there is evidence of Mr Bogolyubov personally communicating in relation \nto only three  of the Borrowers: Dorteks, Uniks and Fiastra.54 None of these communications \nrelate to the “Scheme”  or an y transactions said to form part of it.  \n157. In relation to Dorteks and Uniks, Mr Bogolyubov is party to three  emails  in which they are \nmentioned, all of which concern real estate construction projects in Ukraine (part of the  \n“Land M” project ) and which significantly pre-date the Dorteks and Uniks Relevant Loans  \nentered into in July and August 2014 . None of these emails suggest that Mr Bogolyubov had \nany interest in  – or control over – the corporate vehicles themselves, rather than the \nunderlying land:  \n157.1  The first is an email chain from February/March 2011, in which Mr Bogolyubov was \nforwarded the 2011 budgets for the “Land M” project. He  forwarded these on to Mr \nNovikov {E1/83.1 }. The second attachment contains budgets for all companies \ninvolved, including Dorteks  and Uniks  {E1/83.3} . \n157.2  The second is an email of 12.3.13 (relied upon heavily by the Bank : Bank \nOpening/76(2) ) {AA2/1 /39} from Mr Novikov in which he informs Mr \nBogolyubov of the condition of certain land plots in Kharkov which were planned for construction (the “ Land M Email ”). He tells him that “ In 2005 5 PBC companies \n \n53 The largest s ix are Agroprom tekhnologiya  (24.38% interest for 4 months of the Relevant Period); Alfatrader \n(45% interest), Milorin (21.31% interest for 4 months of the Relevant Period); Ortika (20.577% interest); \nDorteks (48 -50% interest under a discretionary trust) an d Uniks (50% interest under a discretionary trust).  \n54 Note: this does not count related party lists signed by Mr Bogolyubov, which mentioned some of the \nBorrowers but did not identify any interests held by Mr Bogolyubov in them.  \nAA4/1/60\n \n57 \n entered into the lease agreements for land plots in \nKharkiv…Yuniks…Yulait…Dorteks…Derling…Floreks… ”.

Mr Bogolyubov replied “ we won’t fight ” {E1/273 }. \n157.3  The third is an email of 28.10.13 in which Mr Novikov explains t o Mr Bogolyubov \nthat “ 5 companies o f the PBC signed land lease agreements in the city of Kharkov ” and that \nKharkov City Council had refused extensions and filed lawsuits for the termination \nof lease agreements and return of the land, which four of the companies had so far \nlost.

Most  importantly, there is no evidence that Mr Bogolyubov controlled, or was involved in, \nthe entry  of any Borrower  into the Relevant Loans.  \n160. The Bank relies upon a multitude of factors to seek to infer control, addressed in Table  2 \nbelow. Again, t his vast web belies the weak basis for the Bank’s case.  \nAA4/1/61\n \n58 \n Table 2 : Bank’s factors for alleged control of the Borrowers  \nFactor relied upon by the Bank  Response  \n(1) Connections with other parts of \nthe “Scheme” , including that \nsecurity in support of the Relevant \nLoans included the RSA Pledges \ngranted over contractual \nobligations owed by the \nDefendant Suppliers, the Relevant \nLoans were repaid by the \nIntermediary Loans and security \nwas granted in the form of pledges \nover supply agreements entered \ninto by other Borrowers: \nRRRRAPOC/19(f) -(g.1), 19A (a), \n(e) {A1/2/12 }, Bank \nOpening/307(3), 308  \n{AA2/1/ 129} This is circular. For these factors to have any relevance \nto control by Mr Bogolyubov, the Bank must establish \n(at minimum) that Mr Bogolyubov controlled the \nDefendant Suppliers, Intermedia ry Borrowers and \nBorrowers. Yet the Bank also relies upon Mr \nBogolyubov controlling the Borrowers in support of its \ninference that he controlled the Defendant Suppliers \nand Intermediary Borrowers (see below).  \n(2) The terms on which the Relevant Loans were granted ( e.g. their \nsimilarity and the level of the \ninterest rate) and the alleged \nfailure to follow the proper loan \napprovals processes in the Bank \n(RRRRAPOC/19(c) -(e), 19A(c) -\n(d)) {A1/2/1 1}.  These factors do not go anywhere as (i)  Mr Bogolyubov \ndid not control the relevant lending decisions at the \nBank (see above, Section C5(1) ); and (ii) there are a \nnumber of other possible  explanations for the way in \nwhich the Relevant Loans were granted by the Bank \n(see above, Section B2 ). \n(3) Alleged concealment of Mr \nBogolyubov’s interests in the \nBorrowers and Intermediary \nBorrowers  (i): the Luchaninov \nEmail . (a) The Bank’s interpretation of the email (the \nauthenticity  and accuracy of which is not admitted ) \nis not supported by the documents:  \ni. On the face  of the email, there is no suggestion \nthat the intention was to “ disguise D1 and D2’s \nAA4/1/62\n \n59 \n The Bank relies heavily on this  \nemail, saying it made proposals to \n“conceal  connections  between 24 of the  \nBorrowers and D1- 2 which would \notherwise have been apparent from the Bank’s recorded client information”  \n(RRRRAPOC/19(b)) {\nA1/2/11 }, \nBank Opening/Section G1(3)(a)  \n{AA2/1/117 }. ownership and control of the Borrowers from the \nNBU ”.

The proposed solution was \nto remove those shared directorships {E8/163 } \n{E8/164} {E8/165 }. \nii. The companies  which the Luchaninov Email \naccepted were related by virtue of Mr \nBogolyubov and Mr Kolomoisky’s interests \nwere all included in either the Bank’s IFRS or NBU lists as at 1.4.15 or shortly thereafter: see \n{\nK3-E/87L } {K3 -D/100L } {K3-D/107L }.  \niii. To the extent that Mr Bogolyubov and/or Mr Kolomoisky in fact held shareholdings in the 24 \ncompanies, that fact would not be affected by \nchanging sha red directorships.  \niv. Despite the proposals in the Luchaninov \nEmail, the Bank did in fact  include Uniks, \nAlfatrader and Dorteks in its IFRS list as at \n1.7.15, a fact which the Bank does not mention  \n{K3-E/94/8 } {K3-E/94/11}. Dorteks was \nalso included in the Bank’s NBU list by 1.1.16 \n{K3-D/142 }. These three companies are the \nonly ones of the 24 in Mr Luchaninov’s email \nin which Mr Bogolyubov had at the  time an \ninterest over 10%: { A2/33 }. This is \ninconsistent with the purpose of the exercise \nAA4/1/63\n \n60 \n being to conceal companies i n which Mr \nBogolyubov had an interest.  \n(b) In any event, the Luchaninov Email sheds no light \non the question of control by Mr Bogolyubov of the \nBorrowers:  \ni. The Luchaninov  Email was sent after all \nRelevant Loans had been entered into.  \nii. There is no evidence  that Mr Bogolyubov was \ninvolved in the Luchaninov Email or in the \nprocess of determining the Bank’s related \nparties at all: see above Section C5(3) .  \niii. The question of which entities  were technically \nrelated to the Bank pursuant to the relevant \nNBU regulations has no bearing on whether Mr Bogolyubov in fact controlled those entities.  \n(4) Alleged concealment of Mr \nBogolyubov’s interests in the \nBorrowers and Intermediary \nBorrowers  (ii): The Rokoman \nSpreadsheet s, Beneficiary Key and \nGurieva Spreadsheet . \nThe Bank relies upon these as \nshowing that the “ individuals or \nentities who acted as directors and/or \nostensible owners of the Borrowers were regularly replaced on the direct or indirect \ninstructions of D1 and D2 in order to disguise D1 and D2’s ownership and \ncontrol of the Borrowers from the (a) These documents  (the authenticity and accuracy of \nwhich are not admitted ) do not  show what the Bank \nsuggests:  \ni. All of these  documents  post-date the Relevant \nLoans and Relevant Drawdowns.  \nii. There is no evidence that Mr Bogolyubov was involved in the \npreparation of any of these \ndocuments.  \niii. In the Rokoman Spreadsheet55 {E10/264} \n{E10/265 } {E10/265P }, Mr Bogolyubo v \nappears to be coded as beneficiary B4 (see the “Beneficiary Key” { JUN -E/20\n}).

The \nobvious alternat ive explanation is that Bank \nemployees were attempting to alter company \ngroupings to comply with maximum related party \ngroup borrowing thresholds . \n(d) The Gurieva Spreadsheet {E18/213 } does not show \nany directors  or ostensible owners of any Borrower \nbeing replaced. That the Borrowers are mentioned  in \nthe Gurieva  Spreadsheet is necessarily the case in \ncircumstances where the Bank used the Gurieva \nSpreadsheet to build its case: {G2/39/15 } (¶44). \nThe Bank does not rely upon the Gurieva \nSpreadsheet in relation to control in its opening: it is unclear whether  it maintains the point.\n \n(5) Alleged concealment of Mr \nBogolyubov’s interests in the \nBorrowers and Intermediary (a) This is a new point which was not pleaded by the \nBank in support of Mr Bogolyubov’s alleged control of the Borrowers. \nThe Bank’s portrayal of the \nresponse to the NBU’s designation of the 165 \nAA4/1/65\n \n62 \n Borrowers  (iii): the 165 List and \nthe Avellum emails . \nThe Bank alleges that, from \nAugust 2015, the Bank “ took \nconcerted action to conceal D1 -2's \ninterests in the Borrowers a nd \nIntermediary Borrowers”, primarily in \nresponse to the NBU’s 31.7.15 \ndesignation of 165 companies as \nrelated : Bank Opening/Section \nG(1)(3)(c) { AA2/1/12 6}. related parties is extrem ely selective. A full \nchronology of the Bank’s response is contained in Schedule 4  to these openings.  \n(b) In summary, there is no evidence that the Bank was attempting to conceal Mr Bogolyubov’s interests in any companies. By contrast, it appears to have been \nattempting to comply with the NBU’s maximum \nthresholds on related party borrowing : see e.g. \n{E11/128 }.   \n(c) Furthe r, the Bank omits to mention that, in response \nto the NBU’s designation, the Bank initially \n{E11/156 } {E11/158 } accepted  to the NBU that 33 \nparties were related. The  33 included 10 Borrowers \nand two  Intermediary Borrowers.  \n(6) Security for the Relevant Loans : \nthe Bank relies upon certain \nsecurity being given over assets \nowned by Mr Bogolyubov, for \nexample in the form of Share \nPledges (RRRRAPOC/19(a) -(a2)) \n{A1/2/10 }, ( RRRAR/5) \n{A1/25/6 }. Mr Bogolyubov was a beneficiary under a discretionary trust which held an ownership interest in some of these \ncompanies , he gave his general agreement to the Bank \nthat assets in which he held an interest could be \nprovided to the Bank as security  and was aware in \ngeneral terms that security had been given. However, there is no evidence suggesting he was aware of, or at \nall involved in, the grant of the particular Share Pledges  \nthemselves . \n(7) The Structure Charts, Mr \nBogolyubov’s use of nominees in \nholding his assets  and the \nexistence of individuals who were \napparently connected to both the Borrowers and Mr Bogolyubov  (5 \nMay Response, ¶11(d) -(e) \n{\nA2/4/13 }, Annex A { A2/5 }, \nRRRAR /4A {A1/25/5 }, Bank The mere fact that some individuals can apparently be \nlinked both to Mr Bogolyubov and the Borrowers \ncanno t overcome the absence of evidence that Mr \nBogolyubov controlled any of the Borrowers.

As explained above, Mr Bogolyubov used CSPs to help \nstructu re his assets, and the resulting asset structures \nwere complex.  \n(8) That the  Ukrainian Borrowers  \n(save Prominmet)  “participated in \nthe Misappropriation in a coordinated and near -identical fashion ” (RRRAR  \n4) {\nA1/25/5 }, Bank \nOpening/307(1)  {AA2/1/128 } (a) This is of no assistance to the Bank where it cannot \nshow that Mr Bogolyubov  controlled any of the \nUkrainian Borrowers or any of the relevant lending \ndecisions.  \n(b) The evidence shows that it was in fact employees of the Bank, Primecap and/or PBC who administered \nthe “Scheme”  and/or \ndetermined how the \nBorrowers participated in the “ Schem e”: see above, \nSection B2 . Ap parent similarities in their \nparticipation can be explained by this fact.  \n161. The Bank also alleges that Mr Bogolyubov’s denials of ownership are “undermined” by a \nrandom handful of emails, most of which concern Mr Bogolyubov’s interests in underlying assets , explained above. The Bank also relies upon an email from Mr Sokolovskiy which it \nsays shows  that he had “ correctly appreciated that the 42 Borrowers identified in the NashiGroshi \nArticles as having been involved in the Misappropriation were “shareholder companies”. ”: Bank \nOpening/312(4)  {AA2/1/131 }. This is a misleading portrayal of the email, which shows Mr \nSokolovskiy responding to a reques t from Mr Luchaninov to investigate the leak leading to \nthe NashiGroshi article  (which was linked in his email) . Mr Sokolovskiy’s response -  “if I \nunderstand correctly, the request concerns shareholder companies, I have never conducted such investigations.”  \n{E7/307.4}  - is likely to be based on the NashiGroshi article itself, which alleges that the 42 \nCompanies are “ firms with PrivatBank roots ” {E7/276.1 }. \n(ii) Alleged control of the Intermediary Borrowers  \n162. Mr Bogolyubov held indirect interests in 13 of the 34 Intermediary Borrowers for at least some of the period 1.4.13 – 31.12.15 {A2/39.4} . His interests in five did not exceed 3%, \nand his interests in a further five did not exceed 11%. None of his interests exceeded 50%.  \n163. There is no evidence of Mr Bogolyubov exercising any control over any of the Intermediary Borrowers. Moreover, only one Intermediary Borrower is mentioned in the body of  any \nAA4/1/67\n \n64 \n communication with Mr Bogolyubov, namely Floreks, referred to in the  Land M Email. A \nfew other Intermediary Borrowers (Lazurniy Bereg, Floreks, Mondial and Vinibur) appear \nto have bee n involved in the Land M project, and are mentioned in the budgets circulated \nin 2011: see ¶ 157.1 above.  \n164. The Bank again seeks to infer control of the Intermediary  Borrowers by relying upon a \nvariety of factors : Bank Opening/Section G(1)  {AA2/1/118 }, 5 May Response/36 \n{A2/4/34} and the Structure Charts. Those which are relied upon in relation to the \nBorrowers have been addressed above. The remaining  factors are addressed in Table  3 \nbelow.  \n(iii) Alleged control of the New Borrowers  \n165. The Bank’s pleaded case for saying it should be inferred that Mr Bogolyubov owned and/or \ncontrolled the New Borrowers ( RRRAR/31 -32) {A1/25/61 } is particularly weak.

(Mr Bogolyubov accepts he had a \nc.20% interest in Mialis at the time of the Rokoman \nSpreadsheet and a 9.1% interest in  Centrostal until \n20.7.15, 11 days before the Rokoman Spreadsheet \nwas circulated { A2/39.4/2} {A2/39.4/6} .)  \n(b) As set out above, the Rokoman Spreadsheet did not \npropose any change  to Mr Bogo lyubov’s beneficial \ninterest in any company .  \n(c) At any rate, the Rokoman Spreadsheet post -dates \nthe Intermediary  Loans and Intermediary \nDrawdowns. {E10/264 } {E10/265}  {E10/265P } \n(3) All save one of  the Intermediary \nBorrowers were among the 193 \nborrowers whose loans were \n“transformed” and repaid by the This factor has no weight unless the Bank can show \nthat Mr Bogolyubov controlled the New Borrowers \nand the relevant lending decisions.  \nAA4/1/69\n \n66 \n New Borrowers  (also companies \nowned and/or controlled by Mr \nKolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov) \n{A2/4/34}  ¶36(b)(iii) . \n(4) All Intermediary Borrowers  were \nidentified in Lafferty 2 and 3 as \npart of the “Scheme”  of \nuncommercial money transfers  \n{A2/4/34}  ¶36(b)(iv) .

Even if it \nwere the case (which is not admitted) that one  of \nRossyn’s main trading partners was Ukrnafta (an entity \nin which Mr Bogolyubov did have an indirect \n18.0406%  \ninterest), this does not suggest that Mr \nBogolyubov controlled Rossyn.

At any rate, the \nevidence relied upon by the Bank relates near -\nexclusively to Mr Kolomoisky and it is not understood how Mr Bogolyubov is said to be implicated.  \n(9) “D1-2’s funding D3- 8's participation \nin these proceedings”: B ank’s \nOpening/Section G2(4)  \n{AA2/1/144 -146} Again, this was not pleaded by the Bank as a factor upon which Mr Bogolyubov’s control of D3 -8 should \nbe inferred and he objects to its introduction now.  The \nBank again seeks to elide the positions of Mr \nBogolyubov and Mr Kolomoisky.  Such allegations were \naddressed at an interlocutory stage in Maling 14/16 \n{H3/21/4 }. Further, t he Bank’s suggestion that  the \nCourt has already “ [found] prima facie that D1 -2 have been \nfunding D3-8's legal fees” is inaccurate. The Court found that there “ was... some prima facie evidence  that much of the \nmoney that has so far been made available to assist in the funding \nof the case on behalf of the third to eighth defendants emanates \nfrom entities or persons with links to the first and second \ndefendants ” {A5/22/8 } ¶22 (emphasis added) . \n(4) Mr Bogolyubov did not control Primecap or PB C \n167. In the absence of any direct  evidence suggesting that Mr Bogolyubov controlled the \nBorrowers, Intermediary Borrowers and Defendant Suppliers, the Bank makes a further argument that it is to be inferred that Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Kolomoisky controlled the \nrelevant entities through Primecap (in respect of the Defendant Suppliers) and PBC (in \nrespect of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers): RRRRAPOC/12B -C {A1/2/4 }.  \n168. In support of this, the Bank asserts that Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov owned and/or \ncontrolled Primecap and PBC, and that their officers and employees acted on their direct or \nAA4/1/75\n \n72 \n indirect instructions in r elation to the affairs of those entities, including causing them to \nenter into written agreements and transfer funds.  \n169.

Mr Bogolyubov did not own or control Primecap (and the Bank’s case that he did is \ninconsistent with its position in the Cyprus Proceedings of  18.12.19 that it was Mr \nKolomoisky  who beneficially owned Primecap { H1/73.3/7}  ¶17.1) .57  \n171.

Marigold Trust’s interest is not admitted and \nthere is no evidence that Mr Bogolyubov was aware of any such interest.  \n172. At any rate, the transfer of the shares to Primecap’s  employees took place before all of the \ntransactions said to comprise the “Scheme” . The Bank suggests in its openings that this \ntransfer was a sham, saying that the structure “ appears to have been chosen so that Primecap could \nbe removed from the Bank’s “r elated parties list” ”: Bank Opening/94, fn.69  {AA2/1/46 }. For this, \nit relies upon an email of 10.7.13 from Mr Tabakov  to Ms Nikolaeva  {E2/60} . \nUnfortunately, the Bank’s reference is rather misleading. The email shows  Mr Tabakov  \nasking for Primecap to be removed from the Bank’s related parties list because  the beneficial \nowners of Primecap were the 12 employees of Primecap. It  cont ains no suggestion that the \nstructure was chosen so that  Primecap  could be removed from the related parties list. In \nfact, that Primecap was  included in the related parties list before this is inconsistent with the \nBank’s suggestion that there was an attempt to hide any connection.  \n173.  Even if Mr Bogolyubov had an ownership interest in Primecap, this sheds no light on \nwhether he controlled Primecap or, through it, controlled the Defendant Suppliers.  \n174. Mr Bogolyubov’s connections  to Primecap have been explained above. The true position, \nwhich Mr Bogolyubov has always accepte d, is that Primecap provided services to companies \n \n57  Note: the Bank’s case in opening appears to have expanded the alleged relevance of Primecap, as a body \nthrough which Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Kolomoisky generally exercised control over the “Scheme” . However, \nits pleaded case is that Primecap is relevant in relation to Mr Bogolyubov’s a lleged control of the Defendant \nSuppliers and accordingly this is the focus of Mr Bogolyubov’s submissions.  \nAA4/1/76\n \n73 \n in which he has an interest. His links to Primecap (including the existence of any Primecap \nindividuals in the holding structure of his assets) are in this capacity and are benign. Mr Bogolyubov’s relationship with Primecap was formalised in a Services Agreement of 27.7.15, \nwhich set out a list of services that Primecap agreed to provide to Mr Bogolyubov, including \ncoordinating his advisers, communicating with counterparties, corporate rights management, an d preparation and execution of documents  {E10/248.1 }. Further \nagreements appear to have been entered into after Nationalisation e.g. an Agency Agreement \nof 13.6.19 { E17/268}  (unsigned) .  \n175. Primecap also provided services  to the Bank. A n (unsigned)  Services Agreement between \nthe Bank and Primecap approved by the Bank in around March 2016  “formalise[d]” existing \narrangements  {PTR -B1/8 /415 } {PTR -B1/8/430 }. The services included assistance in \nfinding potential clients, outsourcing and coordination of advisers, consultancy services , \nreview and preparation of documents  and assistance in incorporation or acquisition of legal \nentities . \n176. The Bank’s case on Mr Bogolyubov’s alleged control of Primecap is heavily reliant upon his \nrelationship with Mr Novikov : Bank Opening/75 -6  {AA2/1/38 -40}. As to this:  \n176.1  It is correct that Mr Bogolyubov  dealt with Mr Novikov, both in relation to the Bank \nand his assets.

Mr Novikov was at the time the Head of the Bank’s Investment Business and Deputy Chairman of the Management Board.  \n176.2  In relation to his assets , Mr Novikov provided Mr Bogolyubov with infor mation, \nsought his instructions or approval on particular matters, and asked him to sign relevant documentation: see the examples at ¶ 130 above and { K5-E/1} {E1/254.1 } \n{E1/269.1 } {E1/340.1 }. \n176.3  Mr Novikov also sat on the Supervisory Board of some businesses in which Mr Bogolyubov had an interest (e.g. Ukrnafta  {K3-A7/394/7} ) and held an interest  in \nan asset  on behalf of Mr Bogolyubov {J4/5/100 }.  \n176.4  The Bank  relies in particular on  the volume of WhatsApp messages between Mr \nBogolyubov and Mr Novikov (849 messages  between April 2018 and May 2021) : \nBank Opening/75  {AA2/1/38 }. Not only do these messages shed no light on \ncontrol, the y are unhelpful to the Bank. Whilst there are many messages concerning \nassets in which Mr Bogolyubov has  disclosed an interest and in relation to which it \nis accepted that Mr Novikov assisted him (e.g.  NZF, ZZF, MGOK, OGOK, PJSC \nAA4/1/77\n \n74 \n Global Estates, PKSC UkrNIIEngineproject, PJSC Hotel Zhovtnevy), none of the \nDefendant Suppliers is even mentioned.  \n176.5  To similar effect, none of the Defendant Suppliers is mentioned in communications \nabout Mr Bogolyubov’s assets during the R elevant Period, despite numerous \ncompanies being referred to e.g. a spreadsheet of Mr Bogolyubov’s real estate projects \nsent by Mr Novikov to Mr Anischenko on 26.1.16 listed 65 assets, the “ end holding ” \ncompany and the “ asset owner ” company of each asset { E12/215 } {E12/216 }.  \n176.6  Accordingly, Mr Bogolyubov’s relationship with Mr Novikov has an innocent \nexplanation and, moreover , does not suggest that he exercised any control over \nPrimecap or the Defendant Suppliers.  \n176.7  The Bank’s suggestions that it is somehow relevant  to the control of companies  that \nMr Bogolyubov  and Mr Novikov  did things such as “ wished each other  happy birthday ”, \n“shared jokes ” and “ tips on the latest technology ” and that the two attended Mr Marangos’ \nwedding can be dismissed:  Bank Opening/75(1)  {AA2/1/38 }. Equally, the fact th at \nMr Bogolyubov and Mr Novikov spoke by telephone (Bank Opening/76(3))  \n{AA2/1/40 } cannot change the picture painted by the documents , in particular \nwhere Mr Bogolyubov has never denied that they spoke .58  \n177. The only example of alleged control of Primecap upon which the Bank seeks to rely does \nnot relate to Mr Bogolyubov  at all. This is a WhatsApp message  of 20.10.16 {K5-A1/42/4 } \nwhich the Bank says shows that Mr Kolomoisky was “ asked…to approve a $630,000 payment \nof Primecap’s taxes and social insurance. D1 duly approved the payment. It is to be inferred that he did so \nbecause D1 -2 owned and controlled Primecap. ” RRRAR/6B.4 {A1/25/9 }, Bank Opening/94(3)  \n{AA2/1/46 }. Whatever this message in fact means, it is noteworthy that Mr Bogo lyubov  is \nnot told about the payment and hi s approval is never sought . \n178. Accordingly, there is no evidence of Mr Bogolyub ov controlling Primecap or D3 -8. The \nBank’s argument appears to boil down to saying that (i) because Mr Bogolyubov dealt with \nPrimecap in  respect of some companies, this means that he was interested in and controlled \nall companies with which Primecap dealt; and/or (ii) because Mr Bogolyubov dealt with Mr \nNovikov in relation to business and socially, Mr Bogolyubov controlled the company run \n \n58  This was accepted by Mr Bogolyubov in his witness statement : Bogolyubov 4/53 {B2/11/13} . \nAA4/1/78\n \n75 \n by Mr Novikov and all clients of that company.

During the period 20.11.13 to 20.7.15, Mr Bogolyubov held (through a number of other \ncompanies) a small indirect interest in PBC which fluctuated between 3.54% and 11.08% \n{A1/19.1} . There is no evidence that he used this interest to exercise any control over PBC.  \n180. More importantly, there is  no evidence that Mr Bogolyubov dealt with (let alone gave \ninstructions to) PBC  at the relevant time , in relation to the Borrowers, Intermediary \nBorrowers or any other parts of the “Scheme” . PBC was in existence prior to the “Scheme”59 \nand afterwards so th ere is no necessary inference that its only role was  in relation to the \n“Scheme” .  \n181. There are three communications in the bundle to which Mr Bogolyubov is a party just before the relevant time and in which the word “ PBC” is mentioned, none of which provides  \nevidence that he had any such dealings :  \n181.1  Two of these are emails from Mr Novikov in relation to the Land M project (see ¶157 above), in which Mr Novikov describes  the five companies holding interests in \nthe Kharkov land as “ PBC companies ” {E1/273} { E2/170.01 }. The email of 1 3.3.13 \n{E1/273} relied upon by the Bank  as showing Mr Bogolyubov giving  indirect  \ninstructions  to PBC  employees (directors of Dorteks and Uniks)  during the Relevant \nPeriod60 in fact shows Mr Bogolyubov giving instructions to Mr Novikov.  There is \nno mention of the PBC employees  in the email.  \n181.2  The third communication is also an email from Mr Novikov from early 2013, \nconcerning “ KSZ liabilities ”. He tells Mr Bogolyubov that “ funds were withdrawn from the \ndeposit accounts of PBC companies ”{E1/254.1 }. \n182. Further, these emails suggest that the  explanation for PBC individuals being involved in the \nholding structures for some of Mr Bogolyubov’s assets is benign: this was simply part of the asset structuring conducted by Primecap (c.f. RRRRAPOC/12C(a) ) {A1/2/4 }. PBC \n \n59  The Bank accepts in its opening ( Bank Opening/ 279(6) ) that PBC nominees were being used “ six years before \nthe Misappropriation ” {AA2/1/119 }. \n60  RRRRAPOC/12C(e ) {A1/2/5 } \nAA4/1/79\n \n76 \n performed legitimate  services for Mr Bogolyubov. That does not establish that PBC were \nalso acting for Mr Bogolyubov in relation to the balance of their activities.  \n183. There are many documents  showing PBC  to be involved in the various actions said by the \nBank to comprise the “Scheme” . Yet there is no mention of Mr Bogolyubov in these \ndocuments  and no suggestion that he was informed of or concerned in those actions .  \nC6. NO EVIDENCE OF BENEFIT  TO MR BOGOLYUBOV FROM THE “SCHEME ”  \n184. The Bank asserts that Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Kolomoisky were the “ ultimate beneficiaries of \nthe Misappropriation ” {A2/4/5 }. Yet it pleads no clear case as to how it is said that Mr \nBogolyubov is supposed to have benefitted from the alleged “Scheme”  and has provided no \nevidence of any such benefit. If, a s shown below, the Relevant Drawdowns did not \nultimately fund Unreturned Prepayments but (at least for the most part) circled back to the \nBank to repay other lending, it is unclear how Mr Bogolyubov could have benefitted.  \n185.

There is no evidence of Mr Bogolyubov’s involvement in any misappropriation or in any of \nthe lending said to comprise the “Scheme” . The Bank’s case is founded on inference based \non inferences,  jumbling together a vast mosaic of facts and allegations.  \n187. By contrast, there is  direct evidence  of the involvement of numerous other individuals in \nthe relevant lending and other acts said to comprise the “Scheme” .  \n188. In these circumstances, there is no ro om or basis  for an inference that Mr Bogolyubov was \ninvolved  and anything that has happened after Nationalisation cannot affect this .   \nAA4/1/80\n \n77 \n D. ACCOUNTING ANALYSIS OF THE “SCHEME”  \n189. As explained above , the focus of the Bank’s case is on the Relevant Loans, Relevant \nDrawdowns and Unreturned Prepayments. On its case, it is the Relevant Drawdowns which \ncaused it loss: Bank Opening/524(1)  {AA2/1/206} .  \n190. The Bank quantifies  its gross loss as c. US D 1.9bn, representing “( i) the total amount of the net \nRelevant Drawdowns [ i.e. taking into account the extent to which Relevant Drawdowns were \nrepaid  by Relevant Drawdowns ]; and (ii) the total amount of the Unreturned Prepayments to D3 -8” \non the basis that “ the sums misappropriated from the Bank through the Relevant Drawdowns were used \nto fund the Unreturned Prepayments ”: Bank Opening/531  {AA2/1/20 9}. It also  accepts that it \nmust give credit for at least some repayments of the Relevant Drawdowns by way of Asset Transfer, repayment of the New Loans, repayment by external sources and foreign exchange \ngains . Having made these deductions, its total claimed loss comes in at just over USD 1.8bn : \nBank Opening/ 576-7 {AA2/1/2 26}.\n61 \n191. Mr Bogolyubov’s  involvement in any Misappropriation is denied. Further, for the reasons \nset out in Section E  below, the Bank’s case on liability is flawed.  \n192. Even if liability  were established, the Bank has not suffered any, or at least the vast majority \nof, the loss claimed. In particular:  \n192.1  the Relevant Draw downs / Relevant Drawdown Portions  were nearly all repaid and \nto that extent the Bank cannot have suffered loss.62 Only c. UAH 212m/ c. USD \n25m of Relevant Drawdown Portions (defined below) were not repaid . \n192.2  alternatively, the vast majority of Relevant Drawdown Portions  were in fact used to \nrepay other borrowing from the Bank that, on the Bank’s case, would not otherwise have been repaid. Credit must be given to  at least  this extent , namely c. UAH 13.6bn \n/ USD  1.3bn . This leaves c. UAH 5.8bn / USD 577m .  \n192.3  the Bank  cannot have suffered loss by reason of prepayments not being returned by \nthe Relevant Supplier (a third party) to a Borrower (another third party);  \n \n61  This takes into account a small portion of repayments of Relevant Loans by way of Asset Transfer, foreign \nexchange gains, repayment by external sources and repayments of New Loans.  \n62  For the avoidance of doubt, both D1 and D2 rely upon the repayment defence, not, as the Bank suggests in \nits opening, only D1: see D2 RRRRAD/67(4) {A1/18/32}  \n"}

As shown below, the accounting  analysis demonstrates that , on the face of the Bank ’s \ntransactional data,  the vast majority of Relevant Dr awdowns were used to repay other loans \nand were then in fact repaid  by other lending . This is consistent with the factual analysis \n(Section B  above) suggesting that they fell within an ongoing pattern of behaviour and did \nnot themselves cause the Bank loss . To the extent that there was any loss, it must have fallen \nearlier or later in the chain.  \n194. The core differences between the parties  bearing on loss concern (i)  issues of Ukrainian law \n(primarily  whether repayments should be taken into account or can be “disregarded” as the \nBank asserts  and as to the valuation of assets transferred in repayment of the Relevant \nLoans ); (ii) the appropriate accounting methodology to use to determine how Relevant \nDrawdowns were used and from what sources they were repaid; and (iii) the currency of \nloss. Once these issues are resolved, it is anticipated that the experts will be able to agree the \nactual calculations. The Ukrainian law issues are considered in Section E  below.  \nD1. FORENSIC ACCOUNTANCY : PRELIMINARY ISSUES  \n(1) Key issues in dispute  \n195. The forensic accountancy  experts  (Messrs Thompson, Davidson and Steadman)  address a \nnumber of facets of the Bank’s loss claim  and D1 and D2’s defences , three of which are \nfocused on here:  \n195.1  how far the Relevant Loans, Relevant Drawdowns and Relevant Drawdown Portions \nwere repaid, and by w hat sources;  \n195.2  how the Relevant Drawdowns and Relevant Drawdown Portions were used; and  \n195.3  the impact of calculating the Bank’s loss in UAH, USD or a combination of the two.  \n196. Through the iterative process of expert reports and meetings, a large degree of agre ement \nhas been reached between the experts. The main area of remaining disagreement concerns \nthe appropriate forensic accounting methodology to be applied in tracing how repayments \nwere funded and how drawdowns were used. This is ultimately a question for the Court.  \n197. As a result of this iterative process, many of the issues that were in play in the first expert reports are no longer relevant. As a guide for the Court:  \nAA4/1/82\n \n79 \n 197.1  the first joint expert memorandum ( JEM1 ) summarises the key points from \nThompson 1  (served  on behalf of the Bank) , Davidson 1 (on behalf of D1)  and \nSteadman 1  (on behalf of D2) . Much of the material in these early reports has been \nsuperseded. It is noted in particular that the analysis of the Lafferty Spreadsheets in \nThompson 1 is not relevant as the spreadsheets are no longer relied upon by the Ds ;  \n197.2  some of the issues raised in Thompson 2 and Davidson 2 (in particular as to repayment) were subsequently narrowed in Thompson 3 and Davidson 3 ;  \n197.3  the most relevant reports are therefore  Thompson 3 -5, Davidson 3, Steadman 2 and \n3 and the second joint expert memorandum ( JEM2 ). \n(2) Relevant Drawdowns  vs Relevant Drawdown Portions  \n198. The Bank’s case is that the Relevant Drawdowns  caused it loss. However, whilst there were \nc. USD 2.3bn of Relevant Drawdowns, its claim is limited to c. USD 1.9bn.

{"start": 189000, "text": "wed in Thompson 3 and Davidson 3 ;  \n197.3  the most relevant reports are therefore  Thompson 3 -5, Davidson 3, Steadman 2 and \n3 and the second joint expert memorandum ( JEM2 ). \n(2) Relevant Drawdowns  vs Relevant Drawdown Portions  \n198. The Bank’s case is that the Relevant Drawdowns  caused it loss. However, whilst there were \nc. USD 2.3bn of Relevant Drawdowns, its claim is limited to c. USD 1.9bn. Th e Bank say s \nthis equates to the total of the Unreturned Prepayments to which the Bank says the Relevant \nDrawdowns led , alternatively the amount of Relevant Drawdowns the Bank does not accept \nwere validly repaid (primarily by other Relevant Drawdowns)\n63. Accordingly, it must be that \nthe Bank does not claim in respect of c. USD 0.4bn of Relevant Drawdowns.  \n199. Therefore, in quantifying any  loss it is r elevant to (i) determine the portions of the Relevant \nDrawdowns that can be allocated to the  Unreturned Prepayments64 (the Relevant \nDrawdown Portions ); (ii) determine to what extent th e Relevant Drawdown Portions were \nrepaid; and (iii) ascertain the use to  which they  were put.  \n200. Both Mr Davidson and Mr Thompson undertook  an analysis to identify the Relevant \nDrawdown Portions . Mr Davidson ultimately adopted Mr Thompson’s set of Relevant \nDrawdown Portions  (amounting to USD 1,911,877,385)  for the purpose of considering \nrepayment and use of funds.  The Relevant Drawdown Portions were identified using the \nBank’s Methodology (explained below), on the basis that the purpose of this exercise is to \nidentify the portions in respect of which the Bank claims i.e., those w hich, using its \nmethodology, can be allocated to the Unreturned Prepayments. 65   \n \n63  RRRAR/27B.4.1B {A1/25/37}  \n64  These portions are by nature those which the Bank does not accept were used to repay other Relevant \nDrawdowns.  \n65  JEM2/2.1.2 {D4/2/5 } , Thompson3, Appendix 5 -1-1-1 {D1/452} , Davidson 3/1.15 { D2/20/11 } \nAA4/1/83\n \n80 \n 201. The Bank denies that  it is appropriate to use Relevant Drawdown Portions  in determining \nits loss, focusing instead on the Relevant Drawdowns themselves  and denying that it cl aims \nfor only part of (or a portion of) each Relevant Drawdown: Bank Opening/555  \n{AA2/1/2 16}. It is unclear how this could be  inappropriate where the Bank’s case focuses \non the Relevant Drawdowns to the  extent  that they led to the Unreturned Prepayments . \nHowever, as shown below, whether one focuses on the Relevant Drawdowns or Relevant \nDrawdown Portions, it can be demonstrated that most of the funds were used to repay other \nborrowing and were in turn repaid.  \n(3) Competing accounting methodologies  \n202. A key issue in dispute between the parties concerns the appropriate accounting methodology \nto use to determine how the  Relevant Drawdowns/ Relevant Drawdown Portions were used \nand the sources from which they were rep aid.66 \n203. Different tracing methodologies  provide different ways to answer the question of how \nparticular outgoing transactions are funded or how funds from particular transactions are \nused. The answer obtained will depend on the approach used, the judgments applied and the assumptions adopted. Different methodologies may therefore provide different answers \nfor the same transaction. The most appropriate methodology will be context dependent.  \n204. There are two primary competing  methodologies:  \n204.1  Exact Matching (or Alternative Methodology ): this methodology  focuses on \nobserving coincidences of dates and amounts and using these coincidences to match \ntransactions  into and out of an account .  \n204.2  Bank’s Methodology : the Bank’s preferred methodology uses supply agreement \nreference numbers in the free -text field of the transaction data to link transactions \n(Supply Agreement Matching). For example, on its methodology a payment out \nfrom Borrower to Defendant Supplier will be linked to a payment back from \nDefendant S upplier  to Borrower if the  transaction data for "}

For example, on its methodology a payment out \nfrom Borrower to Defendant Supplier will be linked to a payment back from \nDefendant S upplier  to Borrower if the  transaction data for both payments refers  to \nthe same  supply agreement . This is so  even if there is a long gap (of days or months) \nbetween the two transactions. As explained below, the Bank’s Methodology does not \n \n66  The sources of repayment become relevant if the Bank is right that some sources of repayment should be \nignored.  \nAA4/1/84\n \n81 \n consist only of Supply Agreement Matching, but also selectively uses elements of \nExact Matching.  \n205. Mr Bogolyubov’s position is that  Exact Matching is the appropriate  methodology to use \ninsofar as possible. As further explained below: (i) it is preferable as a matter of principle  (in \nthat it approaches the transactions objectively and treats them consistently ); and (ii)  the \ncontemporaneous documents suggest that  this methodology in fact accurately traces the use \nof the  drawn down funds  and (iii) if Article 235 of the Civil Code applies  (to a sham or mock \ntransaction ), the experts agree {C5/1/9 -10} that the court  must identify the transa ction \nwhich the parties actually entered into and resolve the dispute by applying the legal rules that \napply to that actual transactio n. This can only be done through Exact Matching . \n206. As noted below, a small number of the transactions cannot be traced using  Exact Matching \nand so a different methodology has been  applied to those, namely the Bridging Loan \nMethodology . \nD2. REPAYMENT OF THE RELEVANT LOANS , RELEVANT  DRAWDOWNS AND RELEVANT \nDRAWDOWN PORTIONS  \n207. In 2016, the Bank restructured its loan portfolio, by way of the Transformation. This \ninvolved the repayment of outstanding loans to 193 borrowers (including the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers) by loans to 36 new borrowers (the New Loans ). In its 2016 \naccounts, the Bank recognised an impairment in relation to the New Loans.  \n208. After the Transformation, all the balances  on the Borrowers’  accounts at the Bank (apart \nfrom two: those of Tamersa and Prominmet) were reduced to zero. It is common ground \nthat th is is recorded  in the Bank’s transactional data and in the Bank’s financial statements \ni.e. it is common ground that the Bank treated all but two of the Relevant Loans as fully \nrepaid. It is also common ground that the Bank treated all of the Intermediary Loans as fully \nrepaid, as recorded in the transactional data: JEM1/4.1 { D4/1/6 }. \n209. The Relevant  Loans/Relevant Drawdowns were not repaid directly by the Transformation. \nPrior to the Transformation, they were repaid directly  by drawdowns from other Relevant \nLoans; drawdowns from Intermediary Loans; and the Asset Transfer. Some of these further \nAA4/1/85\n \n82 \n drawdowns were ultimately also repaid by the Asset Transfer. Others were ultimately repaid \nby the New Loans in the Transformation.67  \n210. The differences between the parties boil  down to questions as to:  \n210.1  whether the repayments by way of Relevant Loans, Intermediary Loans and New Loans should be taken into account (which is largely a question  of Ukrainian law, \nbut also comprise s a factual element) ;  \n210.2  the appropriate valuations to be ascribed to the assets transferred to the Bank in repayment  of the loans (the Asset Transfer ) (which is partly a question of Ukrainian \nlaw and partly of expert valuation evidence) ; and  \n210.3  the extent to which the Relevant Drawdown Portions were in fact repaid (which depends on the accounting methodology used to trace the repayments).  \n(1) Extent of repayment  \n211.

The parties’ positions on the  extent of repayment recorded in the Bank’s accounts is as \nfollows:  \n211.1  Relevant Loans : it is agreed that all but two of the Relevant Loans were recorded as \nrepaid i.e. all but the Prominmet Loan of c. UAH 433.9m and the Tamersa Loan of \nc. USD 19.2m : List of Common Ground and Issues ¶¶32-33 {AA1/3/14 }, JEM1/4.1 \n{D4/1/6 }.  \n211.2  Relevant Drawdowns : The experts also agree that all but c. USD 37m of the Relevant \nDrawdowns were recorded as repaid i.e. all but the Relevant Drawdown s under the \nProminmet and Tamersa Loans : Thompson 1/Table 4.6  {D1/1/135 }; Davidson \n2/3.18 { D2/11/25 }. \n211.3  Relevant Drawdown Portions : the experts  do not quite agree as to the extent to \nwhich the Relevant Drawdown Portions were repaid. This is due to differences in \nthe methodologies used to track repayments. On Mr Davidson’s analysis (using \nExact Matching and looking at direct repayment), all  but c. USD 25.4m of the \nRelevant Drawdown Portions were repaid (Davidson 2/2.2, 3.19) { D2/11/10 }. On \n \n67  This was the ultimate result, albeit not the next step after direct repayments. The process was iterative e.g. \nsome Relevant  Drawdowns were repaid by drawdowns from other Relevant  Loans before ultimately being \nrepaid by New Loans as part of the Transformation.   \nAA4/1/86\n \n83 \n Mr Thompson’s analysis (using the Bank’s Methodology and looking at ultimate \nrepayment), all but c. USD 31.7m were repaid : Thompson 3/5.15 { D1/440/69} . \n212. The more substantial disagreement concerns the extent to which repayments from different sources  should be taken into account  in assessing the Bank’s loss.  \n(2) Sources of repayment: direct and ultimate  \n213. The Bank’s transactional data records that  c. USD 1.395bn of the Relevant Drawdown \nPortions were repaid directly by cash and c. USD 491m  were repaid directly by assets . The \nrepayments occurred as follows :\n68  \n213.1  cash repayments were made from other Relevant Loans and the Intermediary Loans \nbetween the end of the Relevant Period and up to February 2016 ;  \n213.2  between March and September 2016, the Asset Transfer took place  which repaid \nRelevant and Intermediary Loans69; and  \n213.3  the remaining debt was discharged by the Transformation in October/November \n2016.  \n214. On Mr Bogolyubov’s case, the Court’s analysis can stop at the direct repayment  of the \nRelevant Drawdowns . As a matter of Ukrainian law (as to which, see Section E  below), t his \nrepayment  extinguished the debts and thus any loss caused by the Relevant Drawdowns.  \n215. The Bank’s case, however, is that repayment s funded by the Relevant Loans and \nIntermediary Loans should be ignored. If the Court accepts this, the Bank must nevertheless \ngive credit to the extent that the Relevant Drawdowns were  ultimately  repaid from sources \nit is not entitled to ignore or  accepts are valid. Accordingly, Mr Davidson and Mr Thompson \nhave undertaken analyses of both the direct and ultimate sources of repayme nt of the \nRelevant Drawdowns and Relevant Drawdown Portions.  \n(i) Direct sources of repayment  \n216. Mr Davidson has undertaken an exercise  to determine the direct sources of repayment of \nboth the Relevant Drawdowns and Relevant Drawdown Portions . He sets out a numbe r of \nalternative calculations at JEM2, Appendix 1 { D4/2/21 }, two of which ( based on the \n \n68  Davidson 2/2.2 { D2/11/10 } \n69  It is common ground that all of the Intermediary Drawdowns were recorded in the Bank’s transaction"}

Mr Thompson agrees that these calculations are arithmetically accurate but does not agree \nwith them as a matter of principle, owing to methodological differences. His  equivalent \ncalculations (which ignore the majority of repayments in accordance with the Bank’s case)  \nare at Thompson 4, Appendix 4 -2-3 {D1/474} .  \n(ii) Ultimate sources of repayment  \n218. The experts have analysed the ultimate so urces of repayment of Relevant Drawdowns and \nRelevant Drawdown Portions. They do not agree as to the appropriate methodology to use \nto determine sources of repayment. However, they have agreed on the results which are \nproduced by the alternative methodolog ies: JEM2/4.1 { D4/2/10 }.  \n Exact Matching Bank’s Methodology  \nRelevant \nDrawdowns  Relevant \nDrawdown \nPortions  Relevant \nDrawdowns  Relevant \nDrawdown \nPortions  \nTransformation  40% 42% 45% 54% \nAsset Transfer  30% 30% 33% 40% \nRelevant \nDrawdowns / 20% 16% 16% N/A  \nAA4/1/88\n \n85 \n Relevant Drawdown \nPortions  \nOther external \nsources  0.1%  0.1%  0.1%  0.1%  \nUnpaid Relevant \nDrawdowns  1.6%  1.4%  1.6%  1.7%  \nRepaid by Foreign \nExchange Gain  N/A  N/A  0.2%  0.3%  \nNot possible to \nidentify source of \nrepayment  9.3%  10.6%  3.5%  4.2%  \n219. The main difference between the  experts concerns the Relevant Drawdown Portion analysis \nand whether it can be said that any Relevant Drawdown Portions were themselves used to \nrepay Relevant Drawdown Portions.  \n219.1  On Mr Davidson’s analysis, c. USD  312m  of Relevant Drawdown Portions were \nthemselves used to repay other Relevant Drawdown Portions.  \n219.2  Mr Thompson does not agree that Relevant Drawdown Portions can be the ultimate \nsource of repayment of other Relevant Drawdown Portions.  \n220. This difference results  from the fact that, although the experts start with the same Relevant \nDrawdown Portions (identified using the Bank’s Methodology), they use different \nmethodologies to track the repayments: Mr Thompson uses the Bank’s Methodology and Mr Davidson uses Exact  Matching. Under the Bank’s Methodology, Relevant Drawdown \nPortions could never  be an ultimate source of repayment as this methodology links the use \nof Relevant Drawdown Portions to Unreturned Prepayments. However, they can be under Exact Matching, as this  methodology simply tracks funds rather than matching transaction \ndata references: Davidson 3/3.19- 3.31 { D2/20/37 }.  \n221. Mr Bogolyubov’s position is that  Exact Matching shoul d be used. This is explained further \nbelow; however, as Mr Davidson notes, Exact Matching  is “an objective process, with established \nrules, and has the advantages of working blind from transactional data, unaffected by the results one wants \nto arrive at ”: Davidson 3/2.29 { D2/20/23} . \nAA4/1/89\n \n86 \n (3) To what extent should repayment be taken  into account?  \n222.

{"start": 203000, "text": "tching shoul d be used.

Mr Bogolyubov’s position  is that, if Relevant Drawdowns or Relevant Drawdown Portions \nwere repaid (as recorded in the Bank’s accounts), this should be taken into account by the \nCourt, with the result that there is no loss to this extent.  \n223. The Bank’s case is that the Court  should:  \n223.1  ignore all repayments by Relevant Loans and Intermediary Loan s;  \n223.2  ignore all ultimate repayments (of Relevant and Intermediary Loans) by New Loans, \nsave to the extent that the New Loans themselves were repaid (c. USD 2m) ; \n223.3  give credit for repayment by way of Asset Transfer only to the extent of the Bank’s ex post facto valuation of the assets; and   \n223.4  ignore repayments by sources “ which cannot be identified ” or “ cannot be traced to funds which \noriginated outside the Bank ”: Thompson 3/4.2(b)(iii), 4.140 { D1/440/63 }. \n224. The questions of whether repayment  by Relevant, Intermediary and New Loans  should be \nignored and how the assets should be valued depend on Ukrainian law , considered in \nSection E  below,  and the valuation evidence.  \n225. As to paragraph 223.4 above , this question does not turn upon an issue of Ukrainian law. \nThe Bank has identified no proper basis on which repayment of loans should be ignored if \nthe sources is unascertained. Such repayments (which amount to USD 203m of the Relevant \nDrawdown Portions) could not be discounted even on the basis of the Bank’s  case that \nrepayment by Relevant, Intermediary and New Loans should be ignored.  \n226. At the very least, the Bank has not suffered loss to the extent that the c. USD 312m of Relevant Drawdown Portions were repaid by other Relevant Dra wdown Portions. To \ninclude them in the Bank’s claim is to double count (as the loss would include both the \nRelevant Drawdown Portions constituting the USD 312m and the Relevant Drawdown \nPortions that in fact went to repay that USD 312m): Davidson 3 at 3.19 -3.83 { D2/20/37} .  \nD3. USE OF FUNDS FOR REPAYMENT OF OTHER LOANS  \n227. The Bank’s case is that the Relevant  Drawdowns were used to make Unreturned \nPrepayments to Defendant Supplier s. Factually, this constitutes the core of the alleged \nMisappropriation and is a way in which it is said Mr Bogolyubov benefitted from the \nAA4/1/90\n \n87 \n “Scheme” . It is also  a key part of the Bank’s case as to why it says repayment of the Relevant \nLoans and Relevant Dra wdowns should not be taken into account to reduce its loss.  \n228. Both the appropriate forensic accountancy analysis and contemporaneous documents show \nthat the Bank’s case is fundamentally  flawed. If the use of the funds from the Relevant \nDrawdown Portions is t raced properly, it can be seen that in some cases the funds cannot \nbe linked to Unreturned Prepayments at all; in others, whilst the funds did go to the Defendant Supplier as alleged by the Bank, they then went on to be used to repay other lending by the B ank. The appropriate accounting analysis shows that none  of the Relevant \nDrawdown Portions were ultimately used for Unreturned Prepayments.  \n229. This undermines the Bank’s case on liability. However, even if the Court finds liability, the use of the Relevant D rawdowns becomes  relevant  to loss  if the Court accepts that  the Bank \nis entitled to ignore the repayment of the Relevant Loans. In that situation (as explained \nfurther in Section E below), any loss suffered by the Bank falls to be reduced at least to the \nextent that the Relevant Drawdown Portions were in fact retu rned to the Bank in repayment \nof other lending. This credit amounts to at least c. UAH 13.6bn or USD 1.3bn."}

This credit amounts to at least c. UAH 13.6bn or USD 1.3bn. \n(1) Use of funds: Mr Davidson’s analysis  \n230. Mr Davidson has analysed the use of the Relevant Drawdowns  and Relevant Drawdown \nPortions. He finds that:  \n230.1  At le ast c. USD 1.724bn of the c. USD 2.336bn  Relevant Drawdowns funded the \nrepayment of loans owed to the Bank , with nearly all of this used to repay loans by \nthe Relevant Borrowers or Intermediary Borrowers: Davidson  2/3.30 {D2/11/29 }, \nas updated in JEM2/3.1.1 { D4/2/8 }.70 \n230.2  At least c. USD 1.334 bn/ UAH 13.577bn  of the c. USD 1.9bn / UAH 19.4bn  of \nRelevant Drawdown Portions funded the repayment of loans to the Bank, which (on \nthe Bank’s case71) would not otherwise have been repaid:  Davidson 3, App 3 -5 \n{D2/23/61 }, JEM 2, Appendix 2 { D4/2/24} .72  \n \n70  Mr Thompson agrees that , if it is appropriate to use Mr Davidson’s methodologies, these figures are accurate: \nJEM2/3.1.1 {D4/2/8 }.  \n71  See below fn 1 66. \n72  Mr Thompson has not verified Mr Davidson’s application of his methodologies in respect of Relevant \nDrawdown Potions but agrees with these numbers from an arithmetical perspective: JEM2/3.1.2 { D4/2/9 } \nAA4/1/91\n \n88 \n 231. In undertaking this analysis, Mr Davidson was able to trace  the use of  201 of the 270 \nRelevant Drawdowns: Davidson 1A/5.9 {D2/1.1/13 }. Of the Relevant Drawdown \nPortions that he was unable  fully to trace, he has ascertained that none of these can ultimately \nbe traced to Unreturned Prepayments: Davidson 2/2.34 -2.38, Section 6 {D2/11/18} .  \n(2) Use of funds: competing methodologies  \n232. Mr Davidson used two tracing methodologies to undertake this analysis : Exact Matching \nfor the majority ( c. USD 1.1bn of Relevant Drawdown Portions ); and the Bridging Loan \nMethodology  or a combination of the two methodologies  for the remainder ( c. USD 216m  \nof Relevant Drawdown Portions) : Davidson 3, App 3 -5 {D2/23/61 }, JEM2/3.1.2 \n{D4/2/9 }. \n233. Mr Thompson agrees  that Mr Davidson has accurately applied these methodologies in \nrelation to the Relevant Drawdowns and has checked the arithmetic in relation to the \nRelevant Drawdown Portions JEM2/ 3.1.2 { D4/2/9} . However, the Bank does not accept \nthat it is appropriate to start with Relevant Drawdown Portions and says  that the Bank’s \nMethodology is to be preferred ( RRRAR/35.3.5- 35.4) {A1/25/66 }: on its case, the \nappropriate starting point is the Relevant Drawdowns, and the use of funds may only be taken into account to the extent that Relevant Drawdowns have been used to repay other \nRelevant Drawdowns (c. USD 360m): Thompson 4, Appendix 4 -2-4 {D1/474 }.  \n234. Mr Davidson’s methodologies should be preferred to the Bank’s Methodology. In particular:  \n234.1  Exact Matching and the Bridging Loan Methodology seek  to determine what actually \nhappened to the particular funds a dvanced by the Bank. They start with the Relevant \nDrawdowns and follow them forwards :  \n234.2  Exact Matching involves following the funds through successive bank accounts, \nmatching cash inflows in quantum and time to cash outflows.73 Where possible, the \nexact funds are traced. Where the funds are co -mingled, the combined funds are \ntraced: Davidson  1/5.16- 5.24 { D2/1/29 }. \n \n73  The experts agree on the following definition of Exac t Matching: “a cash tracing methodology by which cash inflows \nto an account are matched to cash outflows, either individually or in aggregate, such that the inflow(s) are traced into the outflow(s) \nwhich match the quantum (in USD or UAH) of the inf"}

Exact Matching does involve an \nelement of judgment or choice in some instances to match transactions based upon coincidence of dates and \namounts (unlike Fir st In First Out) as Mr Steadman explains: Steadman 2/ 2.2 { D3/12/5 }. \nAA4/1/92\n \n89 \n 234.3  The Bridging Loan Methodology is used where Exact Matching is not possible and \nwhere it appears that funds are drawn to allow a borrower to make a prepayment in USD before another returned prepayment (which in reality funds the second \nprepayment) becomes available: Davidson  1/5.31- 35{D2/1/32 }; Davidson \n1A/5.13- 5.22 {D2/1.1/14 }.  \n234.4  By contrast, the Bank’s Methodology starts by identifying the Unreturned \nPrepayments and seeks to identify what  could be said in some way to have led to \nthem, starting with the preconception that funds should be linked by supply agreement refere nces. It ignores the actual flows of funds from one account to \nanother: see further Davidson 2/ 2.27 -2.33 and Section 5 { D2/11/17 }; Steadman \n3/2.1.6 { D3/13/6 }. \n234.5  The Bank’s reliance upon supply agreement references is surprising, where, on the \nBank’s own case, the RSAs are shams and used as a fictitious basis on which to justify \nthe flows of large sums of money.  \n234.6  It is not clear that the free text fields of the transaction data which contain the supply agreement references are reliable or authentic. Mr Bogolyubov  has put the Bank to \nproof on this matter , as explained above  {B5/3 }. In particular,  and despite the Bank \nsuggesting otherwise  (Bank Opening/198(5))  {AA2/1/90 }, some RSAs were only \nsigned after the date of the transactions which refer to them: an example is in  \nSchedule 1 to this opening (Uniks) . It is unclear if the free text fields could be \namended after the event.   \n234.7  Transactions linked by the Bank’s Methodology are often far removed in time. There \nare often months between the Relevant Drawdown and linked Unreturned \nPrepayment e.g. {D1/1/40 }. \n234.8  Moreover, the Bank’s Methodology is not consistent. Mr Thompson relies upon a \ncombination of Supply Agreement Matching and Exact Matching. When considering the flow of transactions between the Borrower and Bank, Exact Matching is used. When considering the flow of transactions between the Borrower and Supplier, \nSupply Agreement Matching is used. Using Supply Agreement Ma tching alone would \nnot always permit the Bank to link a Relevant Drawdown with an Unreturned \nPrepayment. See further the examples at Davidson 2/5.16- 5.20 {D2/11/50 }; \nSteadman 3/2.2 {D3/13/6} . \nAA4/1/93\n \n90 \n 235. A proper tracing exercise is one  that follows the funds objectively, seeking to determine \nwhat the money was actually used for and ignoring any potentially sham or fake explanations. \nThe Bank’s Methodology does the opposite.  \n(3) Use of funds: contemporaneous  documents  \n236. Moreover, in many cases the contemporaneous documents show Bank employees \ndiscussing the intended use of the funds from the Relevant Drawdowns. These \ncontemporaneous documents are consistent with Mr Davidson’ s analysis and show Relevant \nDrawdowns being used to repay other lending by the Bank. It is ironic that the Bank has \nsuggested that “ one most look to the contemporaneous evidence as to the “overall purpose and effect” of the \ninterconnected transactions” (B ank Opening/571)  {AA2/1/224} , whilst failing even to mention \nthe contemporaneous documents which show how the funds we re in fact intended by Ba"}

These \ncontemporaneous documents are consistent with Mr Davidson’ s analysis and show Relevant \nDrawdowns being used to repay other lending by the Bank. It is ironic that the Bank has \nsuggested that “ one most look to the contemporaneous evidence as to the “overall purpose and effect” of the \ninterconnected transactions” (B ank Opening/571)  {AA2/1/224} , whilst failing even to mention \nthe contemporaneous documents which show how the funds we re in fact intended by Bank \nemployees to be used. The weight of the Bank’s own argument is against it, supporting the \nuse of Exact Matching.  \n237. Two examples are given  below, with more given in Schedule 2 .  \n(i) Example 1: Dorteks Relevant Drawdowns of 28.8.14  \n238. The Bank identifies two Relevant Drawdowns  made by Dorteks, both on 28.8.14: (i) a \ndrawdown of UAH 190.7m under Relevant Loan 4D14272I; (ii) a drawdown of UAH 270m under Relevant Loan 4D14270I.  \n239. Mr Thompson traces the funds from these drawdowns to Dorteks and on to Collyer. Under \nthe Bank’s Methodology, the tracing stops there  as, whilst the transaction reference for the \npayment from Dorteks to Collyer refer to RSA  1408- DM, there was no return payment from \nCollyer to Dorteks referring to this same supply ag reement: { D1/190/2 } \nAA4/1/94\n \n91 \n  \n240. Mr Davidson’s analysis, based on Exact  Matching, shows the funds going to Dorteks and \non to Collyer (i.e. the same as Mr Thompson’s analysis up to this stage), but then being paid \nby Collyer to two other borrowers (Gardera and Amadoras) and being used by them to repay \nother borrowing to the Bank { D2/9/33- 43}. \n \n241. Mr Davidson’s funds flow matches up with the contemporaneous documents . For example,  \na Skype message sent by Ms Taranenko on 28.8.14 at 07:37 states “ Loan for  Dorteks  purchase \nof Dorteks 460, 694,152.71 UAH [i.e. the total sum of the two Relevant Drawdowns] for the \npurchase of USD 33 million and counter repayment of Amodaras and G ardera and loan for PF Profit \n1,574,500.00 UAH ” {K6/46.1/ 3}. \nAA4/1/95\n \n92 \n (ii) Example 2: Tamersa Relevant Drawdowns of 13.12.13  \n242. The Bank identifie s nine Relevant  Drawdowns made by Tamersa, two of which were made \non 13.12.13: (i) a drawdown of USD 20m under Relevant Loan 4T13351D; and (ii) a \ndrawdown of USD 32m under Relevant Loan 4T13350D.  \n243. Mr Thompson traces these from the Bank to Tamersa then on t o Kalten Trade (all on \n13.12.13). The next payment he traces is from Kalten Trade back to Tamersa on 27.3.14 (i.e. \nover three months later). H e traces the funds ultimately to an Unreturned Prepayment to \nTrade Point Agro made in June 2014 {D1/150/2 }. The funds are traced no further as there \nis no matching payment back from Trade Point Agro to Tamersa which refers to Supply \nAgreement PT -12/06.  \n \n244. Mr Davidson also traces the payments in the first  instance from the Bank to Tamersa and \non to Kalten Trade. However, he then traces payments back from Kalten Trade to Tamersa and Rapit, which in turn use the payments on to repay other borrowing to the Bank \n{D2/9/530} . All of these transactions took place on the same day as the Relevant \nDrawdowns (13.12.13).  \nAA4/1/96\n \n93 \n  \n245. Again, it is Mr Davidson’s analysis that matches with the purpose of the Relevant \nDrawdowns as stated in the contemporaneous documents. In a Skype chat of 13.12.13, Ms Gubanova told Ms Taranenko “ Today we issue a $52 million return to Tamersa LLC –  Tamersa \nLLC 13.0 and Rapit – 39.0 ” {K6/33} . \n246. It is (to say the least) surprising that Mr Thompson did not consider these contemporaneous \ndocuments before conducting his analysis on the basis of Supply Agreement Matching.  \nD4. CURRENCY OF ALLEGED LOSS  \n247. Finally, insofar as the Court accepts  that the Bank has suffered any loss, the Bank’s loss \nshould be denominated in UAH, not USD (the currency of the Bank’s claim).

CURRENCY OF ALLEGED LOSS  \n247. Finally, insofar as the Court accepts  that the Bank has suffered any loss, the Bank’s loss \nshould be denominated in UAH, not USD (the currency of the Bank’s claim). In particular:  \n247.1  many  of the Relevant Loans and Drawdowns  were originally denominated in UAH , \nwith interest on loans charged in UAH and repayments due in UAH;74 \n247.2  the Bank accounted for all of the Relevant Loans and Drawdowns in UAH (no \nmatter their original currency);  \n247.3  moreover, the Bank  did not account in USD at all  at the time. The Bank’s financial \nstatements for the relevant period recorded the presentation currency and functional \ncurrency of the Bank as UAH (e.g. “ The functional currency of the Bank, and the Bank’s \n \n74  187 of 270 Relevant Drawdowns were in UAH, totalling c. UAH 8.8bn  (c. USD 777m at the date of the \nDrawdowns) . 83 Relevant Drawdowns were in USD, totalling USD 1.56bn  (c. UAH 14.23bn at the date of \nthe Drawdowns) : JEM2/5.1 {D4/2/12 }.  \nAA4/1/97\n \n94 \n presentation currency, is the national currency o f Ukraine, Ukrainian hryvnia (“UAH”) ” \n{K1/4/22 }) and reported all of its assets and liabilities in UAH . See further Davidson \n3/2.41 { D2/20/26} , JEM2/5.2 { D4/2/12 }; \n247.4  the Bank ’s open currency position was restricted to certain thresholds under \nUkrainian law  e.g. {K1/4/71 } {E8/22}  {E18/182 };  \n247.5  the Bank  hedged its foreign currency risk by entering into arrangements with other \nbanks  e.g. {K1/4/71 } and by balancing its open currency position with index -linked \ndomestic government bonds  {E17/148/10 }; \n247.6  Ukrainian regulations required a certain proportion of foreign currency receipts by \nUkrainian borrowers to be converted into UAH (see  ¶65 above);   \n247.7  finally , during the Transformation in October -November 2016, the Bank changed \nall loan currencies to UAH: Note 10 to 2016 Financial Statements { K1/6/34 }.  \n247.8  Indeed,  the Bank (Bank Opening/412)  {AA2/1/171}  describes the position as \nfollows : “the Bank was still left with a hole in its balance sheet representing the  amounts \nmisappropriated from it (which hole was filled with a massive injection of taxpayer funds [in UAH]  \nupon nationalisation): the experts agree that the Bank recognised a loss of UAH 135bn in its \n2016 Financial Statements.”  \n248. Accordingly, whether the Re levant Drawdowns were advanced in UAH or USD, any loss \nsuffered as a result would have been felt by the Bank in UAH . That is confirmed by any  \ncounterfactual analysis .  \n249. By contrast, the Bank has elected to convert all sums advanced under the Relevant Loans in \nUAH into USD, applying the exchange rate as at the date of the transaction. It has done the same for repayments of the Relevant Loans. It presents its alleged loss fully in USD.  \n250. As Mr Davidson explains, presenting the loss in USD vastly inflates the quantification of the Bank’s loss as UAH depreciated significantly against USD over the period 2013 -2023, \nand by 3.4 times over the course of the transactions  relevant to this case (November 2013 \n– December 2016): Davidson 3 , Section C {D2/20/24} ; JEM1/6.4 {D4/1/9 }. For example, \nif the Bank loaned UAH 100 in 2013 and was repaid UAH 100 in 2016, in UAH terms it has suffered no loss. However, if the UAH sum is converted into USD on each of those \ndates, an apparent loss will have been suffered as the UAH depreciated against the USD over that time period. Given the Bank in fact felt the loss in UAH, allowing it to recover for \nAA4/1/98\n \n95 \n currency depreciation would be to permit it to recover a loss which it did not truly feel as a \nresult of  the Relevant Drawdowns.  \n251.

The impact of this  inflationary effect on the claim can be seen as follows :75 \n251.1  If transactions were denominated in UAH, with transactions originating in USD being converted  to UAH at the date of the transaction, the gross value of the Bank’s \nclaim before any credits would be  UAH 19,419,974,381 which at the exchange rate \nas at date of Davidson 3 would be USD 531,035,668: Davidson 3/2.44 { D2/20/28}  \n251.2  If transactions are kept  in their original drawdown currency (i.e. despite Bank \naccounting in UAH), then the gross value of the Bank’s claim before credits would \nbe UAH 8,555,460,157 and USD 1,158,097,397. The total of this in USD using  the \nexchan ge rate as at the date of Davidson 3 would be USD 1,465,184,984: Davidson \n3/2.53 { D2/20/31 }.  \n251.3  If transactions are converted into USD as per the Bank’s claim, the gross val ue of \nthe Bank’s claim before credits is c. USD 1.9bn.  \n252. The Bank’s case on why its claim should be denominated in USD  (Bank Opening/632 -3) \n{AA2/1/246 } is inconsistent with  its loss  claim . In relation to the Relevant Drawdowns \ndenominated in USD, its analysis s tops there, whereas in relation to UAH Relevant \nDrawdowns it claims  that it is relevant to look at further factors such as  indexation fees in \nthe UAH Relevant Loans  and the fact that, on its case, the Relevant Drawdowns were \nsubsequently converted by the B ank into USD prepayments. Yet, the loss in respect of \nwhich the Bank claims is loss caused by the Relevant Drawdowns, not subsequent events. There is no evidence from the Bank that allows a more detailed analysis of the business of the Bank or its funding activities , beyond noting that the support provided by the NBU both \nbefore and after nationalisation appears to have been provided in hryvnia . \n253. The analysis in the context of a claim for damages in  Mann and Proctor on the Legal Aspect \nof Money at\n {M1/34 /7-9} at 5.35 (e) -(g) is of assistance. It is submitted that in relation to \n \n75  Mr Thompson has undertaken slightly different currency calcula tions in Thompson 4; however, these still \nshow a USD 1.2bn difference between the claim being denominated entirely in USD and entirely in UAH \n{D1/461/61}  \nAA4/1/99\n \n96 \n claims in tort the following  principl es point to damages payable in hryvnia . The money of \naccount will :  \n253.1  usually be the currency of the country in which the loss occurred;  \n253.2  be expressed in the currency of the place where the victim resides or carries on \nbusiness ; and \n253.3  be assessed in the local currency according to the circumstances existing at the date \nof breach . \n254. This is also supported by the Ukrainian law evidence, which is that Ukrainian court practice \nis to award damages in UAH76 and that monetary obligations should be expressed and \nfulfilled in UAH.77 Parties may specifically express  obligations in foreign currency, in which \ncase the Civil Code provides that recovery shall be in the UAH equivalent, unless “allowed in \nthe circumst ances, procedure and under the conditions established by law” .78 However, there is no settled \nUkrainian court practice allowing tortious damages to be recovered in foreign currencies \nand there are no established principles for ascertaining the appropriate currency of loss.79 In \nthe absence of any such established rules or practices, and consistently with the foregoing \nanalysis, Mr Bogolyubov will submit that any loss suffered by the Bank is to be assessed in \nUAH.  \nD5.

ASSET VALUATION  \n255. For the reasons given in Section E2(7)  below, Mr Bogolyubov’s primary case is that the \nBank is bound by the valuations of the Transferred Assets recorded in the mortgage \nagreements, pursuant to which the Bank assumed ownership of those assets, and which were \nsubsequently entered into its accounts.  \n256. If, contrary to Mr Bogolyubov’s primary case, the Bank is not so bound, it will be necessary for the Court to assess the fair val ue of these assets. The Bank and Mr Kolomoisky have \n \n76  Nahnybida -3/274 {C4/1/52}.  \n77  Art. 524(1) of the Civil Code: “An obligation shall be expressed in the monetary unit of Ukraine –  hryvnia.”  {C9.2/3/3} \nand Art. 533(1): “A monetary obligation must be fulfilled in hryvnia.” {C9.2/3/4} . \n78  Art. 533(2) –(3): “(2) If an obligation specifies a monetary equivalent in a foreign currency, the amount to be paid in hryvnia is \ndetermined at the official exchange rate of the corresponding currency on the day of payment, unless another procedure for its \ndetermination is established by contract, law or other legal act. (3) The use of foreign currency, as well as payment documen ts in \nforeign currency, when making settlements on the territory of Ukraine for obligations is allowed in the circumstances, procedure \nand under the conditions established by law.”  {C9.2/3/4}  \n79  Mr Beketov has not been able to find any legislation, court practice or judicial guidance addressing these is sues: \nBeketov -11/247 {C9.2/1/93} . \nAA4/1/100\n \n97 \n served a large volume of expert evidence in these regards.80 Mr Bogolyubov has not served \nany expert evidence of his own and, to avoid duplication, will adopt Mr Kolomoisky’s \nsubmissions on this issue.  \nD6. CONCLUSION  \n257. The key decisions for the Court are therefore:  \n257.1  First, whether repayments should be taken into account and if so, to what extent. \nThis involves questions of:  \ni) whether repayment by way of Relevant Loans, Intermediary Loans and/or New \nLoans should be taken into account ;  \nii) what value should be ascribed to assets transferred in repayment of loans;  \niii) whether repayments should be taken into account where the source cannot be \nidentified;  and \niv) the exchange rate and date to be used when repayments are in diff erent \ncurrencies.  \n257.2  Secondly , if repayments should not be taken into account, whether the use of funds \ntransferred pursuant to the Relevant Drawdowns should be taken into account. This \nrequires the Court to determine what methodology it is appropriate to us e in tracing \nthe funds.  \n257.3  Thirdly , whether loss should be denominated in UAH, USD or both.   \n257.4  Fourthly , what interest is payable. D2 will address any disputed issues around interest \nin closing.  \n258. As explained above, the main decisions for the Court are matters  of principle, not arithmetic. \nOnce those decisions are taken, it should be possible for the numbers to be agreed.  \n \n80  Located in volumes D8 –D27.  \nAA4/1/101\n \n98 \n E. LEGAL ANALYSIS  \nE1. OVERVIEW  \n259. It is common ground that the Bank’s claim against Mr Bogolyubov is  governed by Ukrainian \nlaw.81 That claim is advanced  in tort, pursuant to Article 1166 of the Ukrainian Civil Code \n(the Civil Code ),82 which requires a person who causes harm to the property of another by \nunlawful conduct for which they were at fault to pr ovide compensation.83 \n260.

The Bank’s pleading also advances an alternative claim for compensation for alleged \nbreaches of  certain provisions of the Ukrainian Joint Stock Company Law ( the JSC Law ) \nand the Ukrainian Law on Banks and Banking Activity ( the Law on Banks ),84 however the \nevidence of the Bank’s own Ukrainian law expert, Mr Beketov, is that a breach of the se \nprovisions  does not give rise to a freestanding cause of action or remedy .85 The Bank \nevidently accepts that these claims must fail, since it makes no mention of them in its \nOpening or revised draft of the List of Issues .86 Accordingly, they are not addressed  further.  \n261. The Court should be in no doubt as to the novelty of the Bank’s claim from a Ukrainian civil law perspective , as will be expla ined in more detail below. In particular : \n261.1  First, while the Bank frequently refers to its claim as one for ‘misappropriation’ and \nboldly states in the first paragraph of its Opening  that the case concerns fraud and \nmoney laundering on an epic scale , there is no Ukrainian civil law  cause of action for \nfraud or misappropriation.  Misappropriation and embezzlement are criminal  \noffences in Ukrainian law  and it is common ground that such offences can only be \nestablished by a criminal court.87 As explained  above, this is a Ukrainian case and it \nmust be viewed through the prism of Ukrainian, not English, law.  \n261.2  There have been no such convictions and therefore references to ‘misappropriation’ , \n‘embezzlement’  or ‘money laundering’ in the context of the Bank’s U krainian law claims \n \n81 It is also common ground that Ukraine is a civil law system with a codified system of law, that Ukrainian court \ndecisions generally do not creating binding precedent and that academic writings and legal commentary are \nnot a substantive source of law: Joint Memorandum on Ukrainian Law ( Ukr. Law- JM)/1 –4 {C5/1/3 -4}. \n82  RRRAPOC/50 –51 {A1/2/28 -29}. \n83  Art. 1166 of the Ukrainian Civil Code { C2/8/12 } (Mr Alyoshin’s translation).  \n84  RRRRAPOC/56 –57 {A1/2/32 }. \n85  Beketov -8/202 {C1/1/67 }. Instead , a tortious claim under Art. 1166 must be brought relying on the alleged \nbreaches of duty as supplying the necessary element of unlawful conduct.  \n86  The only claim against Mr Bogolyubov identified in the revised List of Issues prepared by the Bank is its c laim \nin tort brought under Art. 1166 –  see ¶2 { AA1/3/2 } and ¶23 { AA1/3/11} . \n87  See: Ukr.Law -JM/38.1 {C5/1/18 }; Alyoshin- 1/236 {C2/1/88 }; Beketov -9/174(a) {C6/1/68 }. \nAA4/1/102\n \n99 \n are misplaced and unhelpful at best. Rather, the required focus must be on whether \nthe Bank can show that Mr Bogolyubov has engaged in conduct which is unlawful \nunder Ukrainian civil law . For all the reasons given below, the Bank cannot  do so.  \n261.3  Secondly , precisely because such matters are dealt with by the criminal law of \nUkraine, the Bank struggles to identify any respect in which Mr Bogolyubov’s alleged \nconduct was unlawful under Ukrainian civil law . The Bank is forced to seek to rely \non articles setting out extremely general interpretative  principles of civil law (which do \nnot themselves render conduct unlawful), provisions restraining the abusive exercise \nof legal rights (which cannot apply, since the Bank does not identify any legal r ights \nallegedly abused by Mr Bogolyubov) and duties said to have been owed by Mr Bogolyubov by virtue of his membership of the Supervisory Board (which are irrelevant, since Mr Bogolyubov is not said to have carried out any acts causing harm \nto the Bank in his capacity as a Supervisory Board member).  \n261.4  Third ly, the Bank fails to identify, as it must"}

It is common ground \nbetween the Ukrainian law experts that procur ing or acquiescing in unlawful conduct \nby another is not itself unlawful  (Mr Beketov says that it will be if the procurer had \nan intention to cause harm, but this has no support in Ukrainian law) . Yet the Bank \ncannot point to any actions or omissions of Mr  Bogolyubov himself which caused it \nharm. At its highest, the Bank’s case is that Mr Bogolyubov  procured the conduct of \nothers which caused it harm, but that is insufficient to give rise to civil liability. \n261.5  Fourthly , the Bank seeks  to manipulate the true scope and effect of Article 1190 of \nthe Civil Code, concerning compensation for harm inflicted jointly by several \npersons, to attempt to patch the holes in its case against Mr Bogolyubov. It presents \nthis article as creating something  akin to a claim in the English law tort of conspiracy, \nin an attempt to hold Mr Bogolyubov liable for the alleged conduct of others, \nclaiming  (for example)  that he  is liable because he  gave Mr Kolomoisky his ‘standing \napproval’ .88 But it is common ground between the Ukrainian law experts that Art. \n1190 does not create a separate basis for liability and that no doctrine of ‘standing approval’  exists in Ukrainian civil law.\n89 Rather, the experts agree that Art. 1190 merely \n \n88  See paragraphs C, F { A2/4/4- 5} and 26(c)(vi) { A2/4/27}  of the Bank’s response to Mr Bogolyubov’s Request \nfor Further Information dated 24 March 2020.  \n89  Ukr.Law -JM/56.1 and 60.1 { C5/1/24 -25}. \nAA4/1/103\n \n100 \n provides for the circumstances when c o-defendants who can each be shown to be  \nliable to the claimant  under other provisions ( e.g. Art. 1166)  will bear that liability on \na joint and several basis.90 Art. 1190 does not provide the solution to the intractable \nproblems with the Bank’s claim.  \n262. With  these introductory remarks out of the way, the remainder of this section addresses in \nmore detail the Ukrainian law issues which concern Mr Bogolyubov.  \nE2. ARTICLE 1166  OF THE CIVIL CODE \n263. The experts agree that the  elements of a tortious claim under Art. 1166 are: (i) unlawful \nconduct; (ii) harm; (iii) causation between the unlawful conduct and the harm; and (iv) fault.91 \nThe claimant bears the burden of establishing the first three elements, while fault is \npresumed and the defendant bears the burden of proving  that they were not at fault in \ncausing the harm.92 \n264. The elements of unlawful conduct and fault necessarily overlap in the context of this case , \nas do harm and causation, and as such are each addressed together below.  \n(1) Unlawful Conduct and Fault: Introductio n \n265. The Bank’s pleaded case93 is that Mr Bogolyubov’s alleged conduct was  unlawful as being \ncontrary to:  \n265.1  General principles of Ukrainian law (Article 3(1)(2) of the Civil Code) and provisions limiting the exercise of civil rights  (Articles 13(2) and 13(3) of  the Civil Code) , which \nare together  said to “ enshrine ... the inviolability of private property and private rights ” (the \nGeneral Principles ).\n94 \n265.2  Specific duties said to have been owed by Mr Bogolyubov under Article 92 of the Civil Code, Article 63 of the JSC Law and/or Articles 42, 43 and 52 of the Law on \nBanks ( the Specific Duties ). \n \n90  Id. at ¶56.1 { C5/1/24 }. \n91  Ukr.Law -JM/22.1 {C5/1/13 }. \n92  Beketov -8/66 {C1/1/21} ; Alyoshin "}

The Bank’s expert also suggests  that any conduct which causes harm will be presumed to be \nunlawful, known as the ‘general tort’  theory, but this is disputed by the other Ukrai nian law \nexperts, who say that there is no such principle.95 The latter view is to be preferred, not least \nsince it is most consistent with the wording of the Civil Code, which does not contain any \nsuch presumption (but, by contrast, does expressly reverse  the burden of proof in relation \nto fault96), and the agreement between the experts that it is the c laimant who bears the \nburden of establishing the first three elements of tortious conduct under Art. 1166 (including \nunlawful conduct).97 But in any event, the Bank has not brought its claim on this basis. It \nhas not relied on any such presumption in pleadings its claim against Mr Bogolyubov and \ninstead alleges breaches of specific provisions of Ukrainian law.98 Therefore even were such \na presumption to exist  in Ukrainian law, it would in any event be irrelevant here.  \n267. The remainder of this section first considers the Bank’s claim for breach of the General \nPrinciples before addressing its case in relation to the Specific Duties.  \n(2) Unlawful conduct: Alleged breaches of the General Principles  \n268. Mr Beketov’s view is that any act which deprives another of their property or which is \nintended to harm another is unlawful pursuant to general  principles of Ukrainian civil law \nenshrined in Arts. 3(1)(2) and 13(2) –(3) of the C ivil Code.99 However, the other Ukrainian \nlaw experts agree that these provisions are incapable of founding a tortious claim. Their \nevidence is that:  \n268.1  Art. 3(1)(2) of the Civil Code100 is an interpretative  guide to the Civil Code, mirroring \nthe Ukrainian constitutional protection of property rights, but is not itself a \nsubstantive rule capable of giving rise to rights or liabilities.101 This is consistent with \n \n95  See: Beketov -8/93 {C1/1/31} ; Alyoshin-1/187– 195 {C2/1/69- 72}; Nahnybida -3/57– 58 {C4/1/10 }; \nUkr.Law -JM/25 {C5/1/13 -14}; Beketov -9/125– 129 {C6/1/47- 48}; Alyoshin -2/91– 97 {C7/1/34 -37}; \nNahnybida -4/15– 22 {C9/1/4 -5}. \n96  See Art. 614 \" The absence of fault shall be proved by the person who breached the obligation .” {C2/8/10 } and Art. 1166(2) \n“A person who has inflicted harm shall be released from liability if he proves that the harm w as inflicted without his fault .” \n{C2/8/12 } \n97  Beketov -8/66 {C1/1/21} ; Alyoshin-1/185 {C2/1/69 }; Alyoshin-1/249 {C2/1/92 }; Ukr.Law -JM/24.1 \n{C5/1/13 }. \n98  RRRRAPOC/51 {A1/2/29 }. The Bank does make passing reference to the alleged presumption in its RRRAR \nat ¶11.3 { A1/25/20} , but that cannot alter how the Bank has in fact formulated its claims in its RRRRAPOC.  \n99  Ukr.Law -JM/28.1 {C5/1/14 }. \n100  Stating: “The fundamental principles of civil legislation are: …(2) the impermissibility of deprivation of the right of ownership \nexcept as provided by the Constitution of Ukraine and by law .” {C2/8/2} . \n101  Alyoshin-1/197– 202 {C2/1/72 -74}; Nahnybida -3/63– 65 {C4/1/11} ; Alyoshin -2/65– 66 {C7/1/26 -27}; \nNahnybida -4/23– 25 {C9/1/5 }. \nAA4/1/105\n \n102 \n the title of the article ( “The general principles of civil legislation” ) and its position within \nthe introductory chapter of the Civil Code, as well as the abse"}

Indeed, it is common \nground between the Ukrainian law experts that there are no reported cases in which \na Ukrainian court has awarded damages based on the abuse of rights.106 Further, and \nfatally, the Bank cannot iden tify, even on its own case, any legally recognised right \n(which it is common ground is required107) that Mr Bogolyubov is alleged to have \nabused: there is no legally recognised right to ‘ misappropriate ’ funds from a bank and \ntherefore no such right capable of being exercised in an abusive or intentionally \nharmful manner.  \n269. There is nothing unusual or surprising in the conclusion that the actions alleged by the Bank \ndo not amount to unlawful conduct for the purposes of Ukrainian civil law pursuant to the General Principles. The capitalist  economy operating in Ukraine could not treat all  acts \nwhich deprive another of their property or which are intended to harm another as  unlawful  \nwithout rendering many ordinary forms of  competitive behaviour unlawful. In addition \nUkrainian law, as a civil law system, does not have a generalised doctrine of civil fraud and imposes liability for fraudulent conduct only in limited specific and defined situations.\n108 \nInstead, most forms of fraudulent behaviour are dealt with by the cr iminal law, including \n \n102  Alyoshin-1/198– 199, 202 { C2/1/73- 74}. \n103  Alyoshin-2/67– 77 {C7/1/27 -29}. \n104  Stating: “(2) When exercising his rights, a person is obliged to refrain from actions that could violate other persons’ rights, or \ndamage the environment or cultural heritage. (3) Actions committed with the intention of harming another person and abuses of  \nrights in other forms are not permitted .” {C2/8/2} . \n105  Alyoshin-1/203– 211 {C2/1/74 -79}; Nahnybida -3/69– 74 {C4/1/12 }. \n106  Ukr.Law -JM/36.3 {C5/1/17 }; Beketov -9/162 {C6/1/63 }. \n107  Ukr.Law -JM/33 {C5/1/16 }. \n108  Alyoshin-1/231– 232 {C2/1/86 -87}. \nAA4/1/106\n \n103 \n the obtaining of property by deceit, abuse of trust or abuse of authority.109 There is no room \nfor any presumption of similarity with English law.  \n270. Victims of behaviour such as misappropriation can seek compensation from the defendant \neither within criminal proceedings110 or, following the defendant’s conviction in the criminal \ncourt, by the bringing of a tortious claim under Art. 1166 of the Civil Code  relying upon the \ncriminal conviction as proof of the necessary element of unlawful conduct.111 Critically, \nhowever, a finding of criminal conduct can only be made by  a criminal court.112 Therefore, \nconduct which is unlawful only in Ukrainian criminal law cannot supply the necessary \nelement of unlawful conduct for a tortious claim under Art. 1166 unless and until  the \ndefendant has been convicted of such conduct in criminal proceedings.  \n271.

Accordingly, the Bank is forced \nto seek to manipulate general principles of Ukrainian civil law to supply the necessary \nelement of unlawful conduct to establish its Art. 1166 claim, but for the reasons given above those attempts must fail.  \n(3) Unlawful conduct: Alleged breaches of the Specific Duties  \n272. The further or alternative way that the Bank puts its case is to contend that Mr Bogolyubov’s alleged conduct was unlawful because  it breached the Specific Duti es. More particularly, the \nBank alleges that Mr Bogolyubov:\n113 \n272.1  Failed to act in good faith and/or in the best interests of the Bank and/or caused the \nBank to enter into purported agreements which were not in its best interests, contrary to Article 92(3) of the Civil Code, Article 63 of the JSC Law and/or Article 42(10) \nof the Law on Banks.  \n272.2  Failed to comply with certain provisions of the Supervisory Board regulations, the \nBank’s charter and/or regulations pertaining to the Bank’s credit committee, \ncontrary to  Article 63 of the JSC Law and Article 42(10) of the Law on Banks.  \n \n109  Alyoshin-1/231 {C2/1/86 -87}. \n110  Pursuant to Art. 128 of the Criminal Procedural Code: Beketov -8/100 {C1/1/33 }; Alyoshin-1/236 \n{C2/1/88 }. \n111  Alyoshin-1/236 {C2/1/88 }. \n112  This is a fundamental constitutio nal principle, enshrined in Article 62 of the Ukrainian constitution: Alyoshin-\n3/3 {C9.1/1/4 }. \n113  RRRRAPOC/51(c) –(e) {A1/2/29 }. \nAA4/1/107\n \n104 \n 272.3  Acted for his own personal gain and/or for the advantage of his affiliates and related \nparties, contrary to Article 43 and 52 of the Law on Banks.  \n273. Subject to two important issues, there is a large measure of agreement between the Ukrainian law experts as to the relevance, application and meaning of these provisions. In summary:  \n273.1  It is agreed that a breach of Art. 92(3) of the Civil Code, Art. 63 of the JSC Law or \nArts. 42/43 of the Law on Ban ks would in principle be capable of amounting to \nunlawful conduct for the purposes of an Art. 1166 claim and that the duties can be \nbreached by action or omission.\n114 \n273.2  It is also common ground that Art. 42(10) of the Law on Banks only came into force \non 10.1.15.115 Accordingly, this article is irrelevant to the Bank’s claim, since the \nconduct which it claims caused its loss ( viz. the making of the Relevant Drawdowns \nand/or the  Unreturned Prepayments ) all occurred prior to January 2015.  \n273.3  Mr Beketov and Mr Alyoshin further agree that:  \ni) Article 92(3) of the Civil Code116 imposes a duty on a company’s representative \nto act in good faith, reasonably, in the best interests of a company and not ultra vires.\n117 \nii) Article 63 of the JSC Law118 requires supervisory board members to act in the \ncompany's best interests, to follow the requirements of the law, the company's charter and other documents, including supervisory board regulations.\n119 \niii) Article 43 of the Law on Bank s120 imposes duties on a bank's executives to \nbehave responsibly, act for the benefit of the bank and its clients, place the \n \n114  Ukr.Law -JM/62 {C5/1/26 }. \n115  Id at 69.2 { C5/1/28 }. \n116  Stating: “An organ or a person who according to the constitutional documents or the law acts in the name of a legal entity is \nobliged to act reasonably and in good faith in the interests of the legal entity, and not to exceed its powers .” {C2/8/3 } \n117  Ukr.Law -JM/63.1 {C5/1/26 }. \n118  Stating: “The officers of a company’s organs shall act in the interests of the company, and observe the requirements o"}

In particular, exe cutives of \nthe bank must:  \n1) discharge their official duties responsibly;  \n2) make decisions within the pow ers conferred on them;  \n \nAA4/1/108\n \n105 \n bank's interests above their own, and refrain from using their office in their \npersonal interests.121 \n274. While the Bank ’s pleading  cites Art. 52 of the Law on Banks,122 no mention is made of this \narticle in Section J1 of the Bank’s  Opening (addressing its case on unla wful conduct) and \nnone of the Ukrainian law experts suggest that this article is relevant to establishing unlawful \nconduct by  Mr Bogolyubov. On the contrary, it is agreed by Mr Beketov and Mr Alyoshin \nthat the purpose of this provision is to prohibit the Bank  from entering into transactions \nwith related parties on non- market terms and that the effect of any breach is to render s uch \ntransactions void or voidable.123 Accordingly, Art. 52 has no relevance to establishing \nunlawful conduct.  \n275. The two key disputes between Mr Beketov and Mr Alyoshin are whether:  \n275.1  Actions taken by an individual otherwise  than in their capacity as a company officer, \nbank executive or member of a supervisory board can breach Art. 92(3) of the Civil \nCode, Art. 63 of the JSC Law or Arts. 42/43 of the Law on Banks. The Bank’s expert contends that such actions will breach these  provisions, while Mr Alyoshin says that \nthese duties apply only when an individual acts in a relevant capacity.\n124 \n275.2  An individual who does  not know of or suspect the unlawful behaviour of others \nwill nevertheless breach these articles if they fail  to preven t harm to the bank. The \nBank’s expert takes an extreme position, contending that a supervisory board member will breach their duties to the bank even if they were unaware of the relevant conduct, such that they could not have stopped it.\n125 Mr Alyoshin’s ev idence is that \nthe position is more nuanced and depends on whether the executives possessed the \nrelevant information and acted in good faith.126 \n276. Mr Bogolyubov will submit that Mr Alyoshin’s evidence127 is to be preferred as being plainly \nthe most consistent with the text of the relevant articles and Ukrainian court practice.

Mr Beketov cannot  identify \nany Ukrainian court decisions which properly support this interpretation of the provisions, \nfor good reason.  \n277. Further, the Bank’s case fails to identify any action by Mr Bogolyubov taken in his capacity \nas a member of its S upervisory Board (his only position within the Bank), or any other \nexercise of a power or responsibility conferred on him by the Bank, which caused the harm it claims to have suffered. On the contrary, the Bank’s case is that the Relevant Loans were not approved by the Supervisory Board\n128 and there is no evidence that they were ever put \nbefore the Board . Mr Alyoshin’s evidence is that members of the S upervisory Board cannot \nbe held liable for failing to prevent the making of loans if their approval was not sought.129 \nIndeed, it would be perverse to hold supervisory board members liable in circumstances \nwhere the requirement for their approval was bypassed (whether deliberately or by \nomission).  \n278. Mr Beketov’s response is to suggest that supervisory board members will be lia ble in such \ncircumstances because their duty to act in good faith imposes a responsibility, in accordance \nwith a resolution passed by the NBU, to monitor the activities of a bank and its compliance \nwith Ukrainian law.130 But any such duty of monitoring cannot be absolute, particularly as it \nis said to arise from the duty of good fa ith. Indeed, the resolution relied on by Mr Beketov \nexpressly provides that “When making decisions,  managers  may rely on information provided by \nemployees of the bank, as well as h ired consultants” .131 If the S upervisory Board members acted in \ngood faith and did not discover that the Bank was planning to issue loans without their \napproval, they cannot be liable for failing to prevent such lending.

Mr Bogolyubov will therefore submit that the Bank’s claim against him under Art. 1166 fails at the first hurdle.  \n(4) Harm and Causation: Introduction  \n282. The next problem for the Bank is to establish that it has suffered harm as a result of\n134 the \nalleged “Scheme” . The fundamental issue that i t faces in this regard is that on either of the \ntwo bases that the Bank puts its case on loss,135 it cannot show that the alleged “Scheme”  \ncaused a recognised harm as a matter of Ukrainian law.  \n(5) Harm: Loss caused by “non -genuine” repayment of the Relevant Dr awdowns  \n283. As to the first  (and it seems from the Bank’s Opening, primary or perhaps even sole136) way \nthat the Bank puts its case, viz.  that it has suffered loss to the extent that the Relevant \n \n132  It is common ground that a defendant will be released from ci vil liability pursuant to Art. 614 of the Civil Code \nif they took all reasonable measures to perform their obligations properly: Ukr.Law-JM/49 {C5/1/21- 22}. \n133  The Bank’s reference to Art. 51 of the JSC Law at ¶43 1 of its Opening { AA2/1/177 } is therefore irrelevant.  \n134  It is common ground that causation is established on a case -by-case basis and tha t it must be established to at \nleast the ‘but for’ standard, though Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida say that the conduct must also be shown to \nhave been the direct, necessary and inevitable cause of the harm: Ukr.Law -JM/41 {C5/1/19 }. \n135  Set out in Response 21 to the Request for Further Information dated 24 March 2020 { A2/4/21 -22}. \n136  In particular at ¶¶528 –532 {AA2/1/208- 209}. \nAA4/1/111\n \n108 \n Drawdowns were not “validly”  repaid,137 the problem for the  Bank is that the Relevant \nDrawdowns were (save for the Relevant Drawdowns  made by Prominmet and Tamersa) \nrepaid in full, through a combination of cash repayments and (as contended by D1 and \nadmitted by the Bank , though outside of Mr Bogolyubov’s own knowledge ) transfers of \nassets onto the Bank’s balance sheet. The Bank contends that such repayments fall to be \ndisregarded and in any event did not reduce its loss,138 but these arguments have no support \nin Ukrainian law.  \n284. As to the Bank’s contention that such repayments fall to be ‘disregarded’ , Mr Alyoshin explains \nthat there is no concept of ‘ ignoring ’ or ‘disregarding ’ a repayment under Ukrainian law.139 The \nSupreme Court of Ukraine has held on a number of occasions that a payment is not capable of being invalid in Ukrainian law,\n140 something  which the Bank’s expert now concedes.141 A \npayment is regarded as a banking operation, which unlike a transaction su ch as a contract, \ncannot be deemed null and void. Further and consistently, the Civil Code expressly provides \nthat a loan shall be deemed repaid at the time when the amount borrowed is transferred to \nthe lender.142 There is no mechanism in Ukrainian law for  treating a loan as if it had not \nbeen repaid when funds have in fact been credited to the loan account by way of repayment.  \n285. It makes no difference to this analysis whether the Relevant Loans themselves were valid or void/voidable.\n143 If the Relevant Loans were invalid, the legal consequence of their invalidity \nwas to require the Borrowers to return the Relevant Drawdowns.144 That is in fact precisely \nwhat occurred and there is no basis in Ukrainian law to treat those repayments as being \nsomehow invalid or ineffective to discharge the  obligations of the Borrowers, whether those \nobligations arose in contract or by operation of law.  \n \n137  See Response 21(a)(i) { A2/4/21 -22}. \n138 RRRAR /2"}

(1) In the event of invalidity of the transaction, ea ch party is obliged to return to the other party all that it has \nreceived according to the transaction ...” {C2/8/5} . This is common ground, see Ukr.Law-JM  /5.7 {C5/1/5 }. \nAA4/1/112\n \n109 \n 286. The position is similarly unaffected by the validity or invalidity of the Intermediary Loans \nor New Loans (which the Bank has  in any event continued to treat as binding agreements145), \nwhich were a source of substantially all of the funds  used to make the cash repayments. The \ncontractual validity of those agreements as between the Bank and the Intermediary/New Borrowers is irrelevant t o the question whether the transfers of funds  made by the original \nBorrowers to the Bank discharged their obligations under the Relevant Loans. As explained \nabove, those transfers occurred as a matter of fact, were reflected in the Bank’s accounts \nand cannot be invalidated or disregarded under Ukrainian law, whatever the contractual validity of the loan agreements between the Bank and the Intermediary/New Borrowers.  \n287. The Bank’s contention that the repayments in any event did not reduce the loss alleged to \nhave been caused to it by the Relevant Drawdowns fares no better on analysis. The Bank \nhas not identified any loss caused to it by the Relevant Drawdowns  other than their alleged \nnon-genuine repayment. Indeed,  the Bank’s argument is circular: it argues that the \nrepayments should be disregarded as not reducing its loss, but the Bank will only have suffered a loss if  the repayments are to be disregarded. Its purported justification for \nignoring the repayments therefore fails: there is no freestanding and indepe ndent loss which \nprovides a principled reason to ignore the repayments. Accordingly, g iven that the Relevant \nLoans were repaid in fact and that such repayments cannot be treated as invalid or otherwise ignored as a matter of Ukrainian law, the only possibl e conclusion is that the  repayments \nserved to extinguish any loss that the Bank might otherwise have suffered by the making of \nthe Relevant Drawdowns.  \n288. This conclusion is strongly supported by the decision of Bryan J in National Bank Trust v Yurov,  in which a Russian bank brought claims against its former majority owners for \norchestrating a circular loan recycling scheme to conceal bad debts  and related -party lending. \nWhile a decision on claims governed by Russian law (and in fact decided on this point by analogy with English law), both the Bank’s expert and Mr Alyoshin refer to and rely on the \nJudge’s reasoning in the relevant regard as being consistent with their understanding of \nUkrainian law.\n146 \n \n145  In particular, the Bank has continued to treat the New Loans as being valid in proceedings against the New \nBorrowers in Ukraine and is therefore precluded by the Ukrainian law principle of venire contra factum proprium  \nand/or the English law princ"}

In that case, the former shareholders argued that the bank ha d not suffered a loss because \nloans which they had procured from the bank in breach of duty were used to repay earlier \nlending which would not otherwise have been repaid. Bryan J found that the former \nshareholders had not in fact established that the earli er loans had in fact gone bad, but also \nheld that the argument was in any event wrong in principle, stating at [1193] –[1194]  \n{M1/22/370 }: \nAs the Bank points out, the Shareholders’ argument involves the acceptance of \nthe proposition that a fraudster  could steal from the Bank to repay his own \nindebtedness and then claim that the Bank has suffered no loss as a result of his \ntheft – such an argument is obviously (and demonstrably) wrong as can be \nillustrated by adapting the Shareholders’ own examples. I n this regard, assume \nthat that the Bank has a nonperforming loan to Borrower A of £1,000; and that \nA is an individual who is entirely and irretrievably unable to pay, so that the \nBank has provisioned the loan as to 100%. On the Shareholders’ premises, thi s \nrepresents an actual, incurred loss to the Bank of £1,000. Now assume that A \nsuccessfully deceives the Bank into handing over to him £1,000 in cash, which \nA uses (as he planned all along) to settle his original debt. When the Bank \ndiscovers the fraud and  sues him, A’s defence (like the Shareholders’ in this case) \nis that the Bank has suffered no loss because it had already lost £1,000; and its loss remains the same after the fraud. That cannot be right. The position would be no different if the fraudster was a different individual, B, who dishonestly \nobtained the money and passed it to A (whether as a conspirator or a benevolent \nbystander) so that he could repay his debt.  \n \nIt is not right as it looks only at the Bank’s net financial position, ignores the \nfact that the earlier loan has in fact been repaid and fails to analyse whether the \nfraudulent conduct in fact caused the loss with which the Bank is left. The \nfallacy and sleight -of-hand is that what is obscured is the fact that when \nwrongfully obtained money is used to repay the initial loan, the original loan loss is not “deferred”, it is extinguished. What subsists, is the loss caused by the fraud not the original lending. This loss (even if in the same \namount) is a different loss caused by a different e vent and in many cases \n(as in the example that involves B as well as A) caused by, and recoverable \nfrom, someone else.  \n290. The Bank focusses on the first paragraph quoted above as answering the so -called ‘Use of \nFunds’  defence, but wholly ignores the import of  the emphasised text in the second \nAA4/1/114\n \n111 \n paragraph, which is that where new lending is used to repay earlier lending, any loss  caused \nby the original lending is extinguished and replaced by a new and different loss caused by \nthe subsequent lending.

Evidently the Bank simply has no answer to \nthe point, yet it is fatal to its claim . \n291. Applied to the facts of the present case, it follows that any loss suffered by the Bank as a result of the making of the Relevant Drawdow ns was extinguished when the Relevant Loans \nwere repaid and replaced  (on the Bank’s case)  first with a new and different loss arising from \nthe Intermediary Loans and then, when the Intermediary Loans were repaid by the New Loans, by a new and different los s arising from the New Loans. It is common ground that  \nthe New Loans remain almost entirely outstanding. Accordingly, in so far as the Bank has \nsuffered any loss, it is a loss caused by the non- repayment of the New Loans.  \n292. However, this is not the loss for which the Bank has claimed. As addressed in Section B  \nabove, the Bank has chosen for its own strategic and jurisdictional reasons to advance a \nnarrowly formulated claim against Mr Bogolyubov premised on the alleged loss caused by \nthe Relevant Drawdowns (or , if this is still the Bank’s case, by the Unreturned \nPrepayments ).\n149 It has not brought a claim for any loss suffered by reason of the non-\nrepayment of the New Loans, despite having recognised an impairment in its 2016 financial \nstatements relating to the loans to the New Borrowers.150 No such impairment has ever been \n \n147  Alyoshin-2/38 {C7/1/16 }. \n148  Beketov -9/200(g) {C6/1/85 }. \n149  The Bank has made clear that this is the case it is pursuing on a number of occasions. In particular: (i ) the \nBank’s RRRRAPOC pleads that Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov are liable to compensate it for the alleged \nloss “caused by the Misappropriation”  (RRRRAPOC/53 {A1/2/31 }), which term is defined by the Bank to refer \nto the alleged “misappropriation of $1,911,877,385 of the Bank’s funds between April 2013 and September 2014”  \n(RRRRAPOC/5 {A1/2/2 }) – this time period coincides with that of the Relevant Drawdowns and pre -dates \nthe drawdown of the Intermediary and New Loans; (ii) in response to Request 7 of Mr Kolomoisky’s RFI \ndated 21 April 2020, which sought clarification as to the Bank’s case on harm, the Bank confirmed that its case  \n“is that the Misappropriation started with the transfer of funds from the Bank to the Borrowers under the Rele vant Loans, as a \nresult of which the Bank suffered a loss.”  (Request 7) { A2/9/9} ; and (iii) in response to Request 28(3)  of Mr \nBogolyubov’s RFI dated 24 March 2020, which also sought information as to the Bank’s case on harm, the Bank stated that it “suffered a loss as a result of the Misappropriation, which began with the transfer of funds from the Bank \nto the Borrowers un der the Relevant Loans. The Borrowers failed validly to repay all or part of the Relevant Drawdowns, leaving \nan outstanding sum of approximately US$1.9 billion.”  (Response 21(d)) { A2/4/22} . \n150  As further explained in Steadman -1/3.2.1– 3.2.7 {D3/1/15 -17}. \nAA4/1/115\n \n112 \n recog nised in relation to the Relevant Loans or the Intermediary Loans, which the Bank has \ncontinued to treat in its accounts as having been repaid.151  \n293.

The Ba nk has not brought any claim in respect of this loss and has therefore \nfailed to establish a relevant harm.  \n294. The Bank’s submission152 that this conclusion is in some manner  unfair because of the \nalleged complexity of identifying the last in a sequence of recycled loans or because the \nfraudster could seek to prevent the victim bringing a claim by continually recycling loans is \nmisplaced. A bank has no difficulty identifying l oans which are outstanding. On the contrary, \nthe difficulty is more likely to be (as is evident from the vast quantity of forensic accounting \nevidence in this  case) in tracing back from those loans to earlier loans which are somehow \nto be regarded as the ‘ true’ cause of loss. Nor could there be any difficulty in the present \ncase, since the New Loans were expressly made for the purpose of repaying the loans of the \n193 Borrowers  with the knowledge of the NBU . Further, it is hard to envision any practical \nscenario in which a fraudster could prevent a victim, which knows that they have a claim \nagainst the fraudster, from being able to bring that claim by procuring further lending from the victim  themselves.  \n295. The Bank’s case is also internally inconsistent. The Ba nk does not claim for the full amount \nof the Relevant Drawdowns (approx. USD 2.3 billion) , on the basis that c. USD 384 million  \nof those drawdowns were used to fund the repayment of other Relevant Drawdowns  \n(resulting in its claimed amount of circa. USD 1.9 billion) .153 Yet on the Bank’s case, the \nRelevant Loans (and thus also the Relevant Drawdowns) are no more legitimate than the \nIntermediary Loans and the New Loans. It is entirely unexplained (and cannot logically be \nexplained) why the Bank is prepared to  recognise repayments of Relevant Drawdowns by \nother Relevant Drawdowns as ‘genuine’ while maintaining that repayments funded by other \n \n151  See Steadman -1/3.3.1– 3.3.2 {D3/1/17 }. \n152  Bank’s Opening, ¶545 { AA2/1/213 }. \n153  Bank’s Opening, ¶534 { AA2/1/210 }. \nAA4/1/116\n \n113 \n similar lending are not ‘genuine’ and are to be ignored.  This further illustrates the \nincoherence of the Bank’s case.  \n(6) Harm: Loss caused by the Unreturned Prepayments  \n296. The Bank’s alternative way of formulating its alleged loss  (if it is still pursued, which is \nunclear) , by reference to the total amount of the Unreturned Prepayments, does not add \nanything to its claim. Mr Alyos hin and Mr Nahnybida’s evidence is that the Bank did not \nsuffer any loss by reason of the Unreturned Prepayments which is independent of, and \ncapable of existing in the absence of, any loss suffered by the making of the Relevant \nDrawdowns.154 \n297. This is plainl y correct. The Bank has no legal interest in the use to which the Relevant \nDrawdowns were put by the Borrowers or whether those Borrowers spent the monies lent \nfor legitimate or illegitimate purposes. The Bank’s interest was in the repayment of the monies it had lent. Provided those monies are repaid (which they were), it matters not  that \nthe particular funds which the Bank lent to the Borrowers are not the same funds in a \nproprietary sense as those which were used to repay the Relevant Loans.\n155 \n298. Put another way, the Bank would no doubt say that it had still suffered a loss if the Defendant Suppliers had returned the prepayments to the Borrowers, but the Borrowers \nhad then failed to repay the Relevant Loans.

Put another way, the Bank would no doubt say that it had still suffered a loss if the Defendant Suppliers had returned the prepayments to the Borrowers, but the Borrowers \nhad then failed to repay the Relevant Loans. Or indeed, if the Borrowers had simply r etained \nthe Relevant Drawdowns in their accounts and failed to repay the Relevant Loans. Mr Beketov’s evidence is that it makes no difference to the Bank’s claim that the proceeds of \nthe Relevant Drawdowns at all times remained in accounts held with the Bank, because in \nUkrainian law money in the account belongs to the customer rather than the bank.\n156 It must \nalso therefore be the case that the Bank did not suffer any additional  loss by reason of \nmonies being transferred from the account of one customer to another (or indeed, if the \nmonies had been transferred to accounts outside of the Bank). What happened to the \nparticular monies (in a proprietary sense) after they were drawn down by the Borrowers is \nwholly irrelevant to the Bank’s claim and does not give rise to any freestanding loss.  \n \n154  Alyoshin-2/49– 53 {C7/1/20 -21}; Nahnybida -3/43 {C4/1/8 } & 55– 56 {C4/1/10 }. \n155  The Bank’s expert asserts that it makes no difference to the Bank’s claim whether the monies paid to the \nDefendant Suppliers were the same (in a proprietary sense) as those transferred by the Bank to the Borrowers: \nBeketov -8/127 {C1/1/42 }. The converse must also be true.  \n156  Beketov -8/118– 122 {C1/1/39 -41}. \nAA4/1/117\n \n114 \n 299. Even if the Court were to assess the Bank’s alleged loss by reference to the value of the \nUnreturned Prepayments, it would be necessary  for the Bank to establish that the Relevant \nDrawdowns, to which it expressly limits its c laim, were the cause of the Unreturned \nPrepayments.157 The forensic accounting evidence in this regard has been addressed above \nat Section  D3 and shows that the Bank cannot convincingly demonstrate that the Relevant \nDrawdowns were in fact used to make the U nreturned Prepayments.  \n(7) Harm: The Asset Transfer and Use of Funds Defence  \n300. If contrary to the foregoing, the repayments of the Relevant Drawdowns are to be ignored \nto the extent that they were not ‘genuine’ , as the Bank contends, two further issues then aris e: \n300.1  In so far as the Relevant Loans were repaid by the transfer of assets onto the Bank’s \nbalance sheet, is the Bank bound by the valuations of those assets recorded in its accounts or may it dispute the appropriateness of those valuations in these \nproceedi ngs? \n300.2  How is the Bank’s loss to be assessed in this scenario and, in particular, what regard should be had to the ultimate destination of the monies advanced by the Bank?  \n301. As to the first issue:  \n301.1  The Bank’s case is that it assumed  ownership of the Transferred Assets pursuant to \nmortgage agreements with the Transferors which purported to record the value of \nthe pledged assets and that those values were recorded in its accounts when \nownership was transferred.\n158 \n301.2  Mr Alyoshin’s evidence is that these valuations are  binding on the Bank provided \nthat the mortgages are valid.159 He further explains  that the Bank is precluded from \nnow disputing the validity of the mortgages in circumstances where it has itself relied \non, and fully executed, the mortgages by assuming owne rship of the pledged \nproperty and has treated the related loans as having been discharged.160 Indeed, the \n \n157  The Bank has chosen to limit its case to the amount of the Relevant Drawdowns which it says were not validly \nrepaid, rather than the total amount of the Relevant Loans.

It follows that if, and to \nthe extent that, the Relevant Drawdowns did not fund the Unreturned Prepayments, they did not cause the \nBank any of its claimed loss.  \n158  RRRAR/27F.4 {A1/25/40} . \n159  Alyoshin-1/149– 163 {C2/1/55 -59}; Alyoshin-2/236– 245 {C7/1/79 -82}. \n160  Alyoshin-1/146– 148 {C2/1/53 -55}; Alyoshin-2/231– 235 {C7/1/77 -79}. \nAA4/1/118\n \n115 \n Bank is plainly acting inconsistently in seeking to retain ownership of the Transferred \nAssets (or the proceeds of their subsequent sale by the Bank) w hile at the same time \ndisputing the validity of the agreements pursuant to which it obtained ownership.  \n301.3  Mr Beketov asserts that the valuations recorded in the mortgages and reflected in the Bank’s accounts are not binding even if the mortgage agreements ar e valid,\n161 but \nprovides no authority for this proposition. It is perhaps unsurprising  that Mr Beketov \nhas been unable to identify any Ukrainian court decisions which supports his view that the Bank could now seek to resile from valuations which it has cont ractually \nagreed and positively relied upon in taking the assets onto its balance sheet.  \n302. As to the second issue:  \n302.1  Mr Alyoshin’s evidence is that if, contrary to his view, the repayments of the Relevant \nLoans are to be ignored, it would then be necessary to examine the net financial position of the Bank and that if the Relevant Drawdowns had ultimately been used to discharge other debts owed to the Bank which would not otherwise have been repaid, that should be taken into account in quantifying the Bank’s los s.\n162 That must \nbe correct, since otherwise the Bank would obtain a windfall.  \n302.2  This view is not inconsistent with the reasoning in National Bank Trust v Yurov , which \nwas premised on the Court’s view that where subsequent lending is used to repay earlier lending, any loss arising from the former lending is extinguished and replaced by a new and different loss. If the Court were to find (contrary to Mr Bogolyubov’s primary case) that this is not the position in Ukrainian law, the Court would need to  \napproach the quantification of any loss suffered by the Bank afresh.  \n302.3  In doing so, it would be necessary to consider the net impact on the Bank’s financial \nposition of the alleged conduct. The evidence in this regard demonstrates that:  \ni) The making of the Re levant Loans did not lead to any net increase in lending \nto entities said by the Bank to have been involved in the “Scheme”  (including \nthe Borrowers, borrowers of the Intermediary Loans and the New \nBorrowers).\n163 \n \n161 Beketov -8/151– 160 {C1/1/49 -53}. \n162  Alyoshin-2/46– 48 {C7/1/19 -48}. \n163  Steadman -1/4.1.4– 4.4.4 {D3/1/18 -23}. \nAA4/1/119\n \n116 \n ii) None of the funds drawn down under the Relev ant Loans left the Bank.164 \niii) At least USD 1 .334bn of the amount of the Relevant Drawdown Portions were \nused to repay loans owed to the Bank by the borrowers of the Relevant, \nIntermediary and New Loans as well as certain other loans repaid during the \n‘Transfo rmation’ .165 Given that the Bank’s case is that such borrowers were shell \ncompanies with no trading history or assets and had no real prospect of \nrepaying those loans,166 the Bank did not suffer any net loss to the extent that \nthe Relevant Drawdown Portions were used t o repay these loans, since they \nwould not oth"}

The Ukrainian law experts disagree as to whether : (i) the Bank can bring a tortious claim \nagainst third parties (including the  Defendants) for loss caused by the non- performance of \na contractual counterparty or is limited to pursuing contractual remedies;168 (ii) the Bank’s \nclaims in tort against Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov will be barred by  the principle \nagainst competition of claims if they had employment contracts with the Bank.169  \n304. Mr Alyoshin’s evidence is that  the Bank cannot bring a claim against the Defendants in \nrespect of any harm it claims to have suffered by the alleged non -perform ance by the \nRelevant Borrowers of their contractual obligations, save to the extent that any such loss \narises out  of a breach by Mr Bogolyubov or Mr Kolomoisky of any duties they owed as \nofficers of the Bank.170 Further, the Bank  cannot bring a tortious cla im against them if  the \n \n164  Steadman -1/5.3.1– 5.3.4 {D3/1/25 -26}. \n165  Davidson -2/2.6– 2.16 {D2/11/12 -14}; Davidson 3, Appendix 3 -5 {D2/23/ 61} \n166  See: RRRRAPOC/18, 18A {A1/2/8 -9} & 52(1)(iv) {A1/2/30 }; the Bank’s Summary of its Statements of \nFacts/9 {F1/1/2 }, 12(b) –(c) {F1/1/4 }, 30(b) –(c) {F1/1/9 }. \n167  Davidson -2/2.12– 2.16 {D2/11/14 }. \n168  See: Ukr.Law -JM/95 {C5/1/37 -38}; Beketov -8/277– 280 {C1/1/88 –89}; Alyoshin- 1/173– 179 {C2/1/63 -\n65}; Beketov -9/352– 361 {C6/1/1 36-140}; Alyoshin- 2/246– 247 {C7/1/82 -84}. \n169  See: Ukr.Law -JM/9 6–97 {C5/1/38} ; Beketov -8/281– 284 {C1/1/90- 92}; Alyoshin -1/180– 182 {C2/1/66-\n67}; Beketov -9/362– 365 {C6/1/140 -141}; Alyoshin-2/247 –254 {C7/1/83 -85}. \n170  Alyoshin-1/179– 180 {C2/1/65 -66}. \nAA4/1/120\n \n117 \n claim could also be brought under their contracts with the Bank .171 For the sake of brevity, \nMr Bogolyubov will adopt Mr Kolomoisky’s submissions  on this issue.  \nE3. ARTICLE 1190  OF THE CIVIL CODE \n305. The Bank also seeks to hold Mr Bogolyubov jointly and severally liable for the harm it claims \nto have suffered pursuant to Art. 1190 of the Civil Code. The Ukrainian law experts agree that this article does not create a separate basis for liability and rather provides for the \ncircumstances when tw o or more co- defendants  who are liable to the claimant will be held \njointly and severally liable for the harm (rather than liable only for the share of the harm \ndirectly attributable to their unlawful conduct).\n172 \n306. However, the Bank seeks to go further and use Art. 1190 to plug the gaps in its case against \nMr Bogolyubov, in particular by contending that a person can be held liable for the actions of another if they procured or approved those actions ( either specifically or if they have \ngiven the other their ‘ standing approval’  to act , even if that approval did not encompass acting \nunlawfully ).\n173 \n307. The Bank’s case has no support in Ukrainian law. In particular:  \n307.1  It is common ground between the experts, that Ukrainian law does not have any civil \nlaw equivalent to the English tort of conspiracy.174 Art. 1190 does not create any \nform of accessory liability, which on"}

The Bank’s case has no support in Ukrainian law. In particular:  \n307.1  It is common ground between the experts, that Ukrainian law does not have any civil \nlaw equivalent to the English tort of conspiracy.174 Art. 1190 does not create any \nform of accessory liability, which only exists in Ukrainian criminal law (and cannot \nbe applied to civil clai ms, whether by analogy or otherwise) .175 Therefore, the \nclaimant must first establish that each defendant is separately liable under Art. 1166 \nbefore Art. 1190 can apply.176 \n307.2  As to this, the Ukrainian law experts agree that approving another’s unlawful act does \nnot itself constitute unlawful conduct.177 Therefore, if the approver committed no \nother unlawful act which was causative of the harm, the claimant will not be able to \n \n171  Alyoshin-1/181– 182 {C2/1/66 -67}; Alyoshin-2/248– 250 {C7/1/84 }. \n172  Ukr.Law -JM/56.1 {C5/1/24 }.

The experts further agree that Art. 1190 does not qualify \nany conduct as unlawful,178 so this provision cannot be used to circumvent the \nrequirement for the claimant to demonstrate that each defendant committed \nunlawful conduct whi ch caused it loss.  \n307.3  The experts further agree that Ukrainian law does not recognise  any concept of \n‘standing approval’ .179 Accordingly, and since approving another’s conduct is not in any \nevent itself an unlawful act, the Bank’s claim that Mr Bogolyubov gave  Mr \nKolomoisky his standing approval is irrelevant.180 \nE4. LIMITATION  \n308. It is common ground that the Bank’s claims are subject to a three -year limitation period \nwhich begins to run from the date when the claimant had actual or constructive knowledge of either the  violation of its rights or  the identity  of the person who violated such right  \n(albeit that there is a dispute as to whether “or” should actually be read as “and”) .181 It is \nalso agreed that when determining the claimant’s constructive knowledge, they will be \nassumed to exercise a reasonable degree of prudence and take a reasonable level of interest \nin the state of their affairs.182 \n309. The experts further agree that the Court has a discretion to disapply a limitation period if \nthere are valid reasons to do so an d that this is heavily fact dependent and must be decided \non a case -by-case basis.183 The key consideration is whether there are objective reasons \nbeyond the claimant's control that prevented or significantly hindered it from bringing the action in due time .\n184 A lack of knowledge of the identity of the  defendant may constitute a \nvalid reason, but this will depend on the circumstances.185 Indeed, Mr Alyoshin’s evidence \nis that such cases will be exceptional and the mere fact that Mr Bogolyubov and Mr \n \n178  Ukr.Law -JM/56.2 {C5/1/24 }. \n179  Ukr.Law -JM/60.1 {C5/1/25 }. \n180  Marchukov -1/43– 51 {C3/1/17 –19}. \n181  Ukr.Law -JM/99.1, 100.1 { C5/1/39} .

There are  a number  of issues between the Ukrainian law experts which will need to be \nexplored at trial including : \n310.1  Whether, despite the clear use of the word “or”  in Art. 261(1), the claimant needs to \nknow both that their rights have been violated and the identity of the defendant (as \nMr Beketov contends) or only the former (as Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida say).187 \n310.2  Whet her, for limitation to begin to run, the claimant must have sufficient  \ninformation to file a claim at court (as Mr Beketov says) or whether a good faith \nbelief that their rights have been violated is sufficient (as Mr Alyoshin and Mr \nNahnybida say).188 \n310.3  Whos e knowledge is attributable to the Bank  for the purposes of assessing whether \nit knew enough for limitation to begin to run?189 \n311. However, the starting point is that the Bank’s claims are prima facie  time barred . In so far as \nthe Bank contends that it s rights  were violated by the making of the Relevant Drawdowns, \nthis violation occurred no later than the date of the last Relevant Drawdown  (August \n2014190).191 Alternatively, in so far as the Bank  contends that its rights were violated by the \nmaking of the Unreturned Prepayments, the last such prepayment was made on 1 September \n2014.192 \n312. It is for the Bank to demonstrate that it did not have actual or constructive knowledge of \nthese alleged violations of its rights prior to 21 December 2014,193 but it faces an  almost \ncertainly  insurmountable  struggle  given the preponderance of evidence (set out above)  that \nnot only were the senior management of the Bank (such as Mr Dubilet and Ms Gurieva) \n \n186  Alyoshin-1/303 {C2/1/111} ; Alyoshin-2/297– 300 {C7/1/96 -98}. \n187  Ukr.Law -JM/101 {C5/1/39 -40}. \n188  Ukr.Law -JM/102 {C5/1/40} .

Further, allegations of widespread related party lending at the Bank  and, indeed, of \nmisapp ropriation of the Bank’s funds through prepayments made to UK companies were \npublicly circulating prior to 21 December 2014. In particular:  \n313.1  Ms Gontareva, who joined the NBU as Governor in June 2014, following a career \nin the private sector has since writte n that:195 \nAs a market participant, I already knew PrivatBank had major problems.

However, foreign partners still did not deliver the goods within \nthe specified timeframe.

In view of the foregoing, Mr Bogolyubov will submit that the Bank plainly had sufficient \nactual or constructive knowledge of its claims for time to have begun to run prior to 21 December 2014.

The relevant question must \nbe whether the provision itself is manifestly incompatible with public policy, not its effect when applied to a particular case.  \n314.4  There is nothing about a three -year limitation period that is manifestly incompatible \nwith English public policy.
