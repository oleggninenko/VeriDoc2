Introduction  \nIntroduction  \n1.1 I am the same Mark Bezant who prepared  reports in this matter dated:  \n(1) 24 November 2021 ( my “ First Share Pledges Report ”, or “ MB1 -SP”, and my \n“First Transferred Assets Report ”, or “ MB1 -TA”); and  \n(2) 29 April 2022 (my “ Second Share Pledges Report ”, or  “MB2 -SP”).1  \n1.2 This is one of two supplemental expert reports that I have produced dated \n14 July 2022. In this report, I address  my supplemental evidence in respect of the \nTransferred Assets. I refer to this report as my “Second Transferred Assets \nReport ”. I provide my supplemental evidence in respect of the Share Pledges in a \nseparate report ( my “Third  Share Pledges Report ”). \n1.3 In my First Transferred Assets Report (referred to in this report as my “ First \nReport ”), I was instructed to provide my expert opinion on the market value of \nthe following  Transferred Assets, around the date(s) they were transferred to the \nBank:2 \n(1)  246 petrol stations;  \n(2)  72 oil storage facilities; and  \n(3)  four real estate assets, being two hotels and two office buildings.  \n1.4 I was instructed to apply the definition of market value provided in the 2013 \nedition of the International Valuation Standar ds, and adopted a valuation date of \n1 July 2016.3  \n1.5 Since the date of my First  Report , I have been provided with two expert reports \nrelating to the Transferred Assets by Mr Brent Kaczmarek (“ Mr Kaczmarek ”) \nwhich were submitted  on behalf of the First Defend ant: \n(1) a report dated 24 January 2022 which addresses the fair value4 of the real \nestate assets (“ Mr Kaczmarek’s First Report ”, or “ BK1”); and \n \n1  I use the same defined terms in this report that I used in my First Transferred Assets \nReport. I set out additional defined terms in the glossary to this report.  \n2  MB1 -TA, ¶ 1.24.  \n3  MB1 -TA, ¶¶ 1.25 to 1.26.  \n4  In this report I refer to fair value as defined for the p"}

I set out additional defined terms in the glossary to this report.  \n2  MB1 -TA, ¶ 1.24.  \n3  MB1 -TA, ¶¶ 1.25 to 1.26.  \n4  In this report I refer to fair value as defined for the purpose of financial report ing, and not \nas the term is deployed in certain legal matters (such as share holder disputes).  \nD26/1/3\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 4 (2) a second report dated 21 February 2022 which addresses the fair value of \nthe petrol stations and oil stora ge facilities (“ Mr Kaczmarek’s Second \nReport ” or “BK2”).  \n1.6 On 21 March 2022, Mr Kaczmarek and I agreed a joint statement (the “ TA Joint \nStatement ” or “TA-JS”).  \n1.7 Since my First Report I have also been provided  with  documents which include : \n(1) more detailed petrol station volume  data  underlying the  BT Original  PS \nReport;  \n(2) information setting out the results of the auctions of a further 13 OSFs \ncompleted since the date of my First Report;  \n(3) a report by Veritas dated 18 August 2016 valuing 36 OSFs as at 30 June \n2016 (the “ Veritas OSF Report ”); and \n(4) a report by PA valuin g Hotel Zirka in 2019 ( the “PA 2019 Zirka Report ”). \nInstructions  \n1.8 I have been instructed to review and comment on Mr Kaczmarek’s reports, and to \nconsider whether the conclusions in my First Report require updating in the light \nof Mr Kaczmarek’s reports, th e TA Joint Statement, and the further documents \nwith which I have been provided.   \n1.9 I have also been instructed to value two additional OSFs.5  \nSources of information  \n1.10 I set out in  Appendix 1  a full list of the documents on which I rely in this report  in \naddition to those relied  on in my First Report .  \n1.11 I set out in Appendix 2  a list of the short form references to certain documents \nthat I use throughout this report.  \nRestrictions, assistance and calculations  \n1.12 Paragraphs 1.33 to 1.3 8 of my First Report apply equally to this report.  \nStructure of this report  \n1.13 The structure of the remainder of this report is as follows.   \n1.14 In Section 2 , I summarise my conclusions.  \n \n5  Exhibit MB -A301: Second supplemental letter of instruction.  \nD26/1/4\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 5 1.15 Mr Kaczmarek ’s instructions differ to my own . In Section 3  I compare our \nrespective instructions . Except for the impact of our chosen valuation dates on \nthe value of Petrol Stations and OSFs,  our instructions do not drive significant \ndifferences in our conclusions . However, I disagree with Mr  Kaczmarek’s \ninterpretation of the sta ndard of value he is instructed to use .   \n1.16 In my First Report , I relied upon  EY’s audit opinions on the Bank’s financial \nstatements and the work contained in the EY Report as support for my view that \nthe values claimed by the Defendants (based on the Original 2016 Values) were \noverstated. Mr Kaczmarek has a different view of the implications of EY’s wor k, on \nwhich I comment in Section 4.  \n1.17 The most material differences in our respective valuations relate to the Petrol \nStations and the OSFs. In Section 5 I set out some preliminary remarks which \napply to both sets of assets.  \n1.18 I comment on Mr Kaczmarek ’s vie ws on the value of the Petrol Stations in \nSections 6 to 8: \n(1) we both perform a valuation of the Petrol Stations by reference to a DCF.

Summary of conclusions  \nIntroduction  \n2.1 In this section, I summarise my conclusions.  \nSummary of Mr Kaczmarek’s and my own conclusions  \n2.2 Mr Kaczmarek values the same set of Transferred Assets that I do, together with \ncertain additional assets.6  \n2.3 Having reviewed Mr Kaczmarek’s reports and the additional information provided \nto me  since my First Report, I have not identified anything which causes me to \nrevise my valuations. However, I have been instructed to value two additional \nOSFs which I was not  previously instructed to value. In Table 2-1 below, I compare \nthe Original 2016 Values and the Restated 2016 Values of the Transferred Assets \nwith my valuations as at 1 July 2016 and Mr Kaczmarek’s valuations as at \n31 December  2016.  \nTable 2-1: Summary of assessments of the Transferred Assets (UAH million)  \nAsset  Original 2016 \nValues  Restated \n2016 Values  My value  Mr Kaczmarek’s \nvalue  \nPetrol Stations  6,341  1,852         1,869  8,444  \nOSFs (original 72)  5,685  312          521  2,370  \nOSFs (further 2)  206 13 18 N/A \nHotel Zirka  1,617  874        1,072  1,321  \nHotel Mir  449 226          252  259 \nKyiv Office  322 194 194 245 \nDnipro Office  212 212         175 212 \nTotal (exc. 2 OSFs)  14,627  3,669  4,083  12,851  \nTotal (inc. 2 OSFs)  14,833  3,682  4,101 N/A \nNote: I understand that Mr Kaczmarek is instructed to value one additional OSF in \nhis supplemental report, although the TA Joint Statement does not record which \nOSF this is.  \nSources: Table 10 -1; Table A7 -3; MB1 -TA, ¶¶ 6.5, 6.6 and 6.7 , Table 2 -1, and Table \n2-5; BK1 , Table 1; BK2 , Table 1 ; TA-JS, ¶ 2.4 . \n \n6  Mr Kaczmarek values a football stadium, training centre and airfield which I am not \ninstructed to value. Another expert, Mr Paul Thomas, has been instructed by the Claimant \nto value these assets.  \nD26/1/6\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 7 2.4 Table 2-1 above  shows that:  \n(1) in total, Mr Kaczmarek’s valuations are more than three times my own. This \nis principally due to the significant differences in our valuations of the \nPetrol Stations and OSFs. Our valuations of the real estate assets are more \nsimilar, with the largest difference in respect of these assets relating to a \nsingle point of disagreement in respect of Hotel Zirka;  \n(2) despite the significant difference in our valuations, we both arrive at a total \nvalue that is lower than the Original 2016 Values, although for one class of \nasset (the Petrol Stations) Mr Kaczmarek ’s valuation  is significantly  higher \nthan the Original 2016 Values; and  \n(3) my own valuations are broadly consistent with the Restated 2016 Values, \nwhich were accepted by the "}

There rema in considerable differences between \nMr Kaczmarek and me as regards both the approach to the respective valuations \nand our overall conclusions. This report is extensive and, in places, technical as a \nresult. It may therefore assist the Court if I make a few  overarching remarks on my \nand Mr Kaczmarek’s valuations.  \nFacts for which there is contradictory evidence  \n2.6 Mr Kaczmarek and I have different understandings of certain facts that affect our \nconclusions. There are areas where, in my view, Mr Kaczmarek has ma de \nunsupported assertions which differ to my understanding of the facts of this \ndispute. Two of these differences explain much of the difference for the two \ngroups of asset s where our valuations are furthest apart . The largest difference in \nour respective valuations of the Petrol Stations arises due to different \nassumptions about their fuel sales volumes, and the largest difference in our \nrespective valuations of the OSFs arises due to a different assumption about the \nOSFs’ operational status. In both cases  there are documents which provide \ninconsistent information.  \n2.7 In the case of the Petrol Station volumes , the Original 2016 Values were assessed \nassuming much higher volumes than the Restated 2016 Values. Further, when the \nOriginal 2016 Values were being pr epared, the Bank (prior to its nationalisation) \nprovided inconsistent data on the Petrol Stations’ historical volumes to the \nvaluers that it engaged. In particular, there are differences between the volumes \nthat it provided to UCE and to Veritas on the one  hand, and to BT on the other.  \nD26/1/7\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 8 2.8 Mr Kaczmarek relies on the volumes provided to UCE/Veritas on the basis that \nthey are “ sufficiently detailed ”,7 although they are inconsistent with the equally \ndetailed volumes provided to BT, which Mr Kaczmarek does not re ly upon. \nWithout any evidence to support this, Mr Kaczmarek discounts the inconsistencies \nbetween the two sets of volumes because they “ could be due to an error on the \npart of the enterprise owners, the Bank, or  [BT]”.8 Mr Kaczmarek does not explain \nwhy h e considers that the volumes provided to BT are more reliable than those \nprovided to UCE and Veritas . He also does not explain why both sets of volumes \nare high relative to the sales volumes reported by other sources in respect of \nUkrainian petrol stations generally and Privat Group  petrol stations.  \n2.9 I rely on the volume estimates underlying the Restated 2016 Values. These \nvolumes were assessed by reviewing volume information collected in 2017 but \nwere intended to provide an estimate of sales volumes in 2015 and the first half \nof 2016. Mr Kaczmarek considers my reliance on these volumes to be \ninappropriate  because they were estimated after my valuation date, based on \n2017 data. In contrast, I consider that they provide a better reflection of volumes \nin the period leading up to my valuation date (and Mr Kaczmarek’s valuation date) \nthan the volumes on which M r Kaczmarek relies. In particular, my volume \nassumptions are more consistent with the sales volumes of Ukrainian petrol \nstations generally (as reported by Ukraine’s statistical authority) and for Privat \nGroup  petrol stations in par"}

In particular, my volume \nassumptions are more consistent with the sales volumes of Ukrainian petrol \nstations generally (as reported by Ukraine’s statistical authority) and for Privat \nGroup  petrol stations in particular (as reported by N aftogaz).9 \n2.10 There is also inconsistent information as at 201 6 in respect of the operational \nstatus of the OSFs . Based on the available information I understand that many of \nthe OSFs were not operational at this time. Mr  Kaczmarek asserts that this is \nincor rect because it would imply that the Petrol Stations were paying third parties \nfor fuel storage as opposed to using the OSFs. He considers this is “ economically \nillogical ”.10 In making this assertion, Mr  Kaczmarek implicitly assumes that:  \n(1) the Petrol St ations required the use of storage facilities;  \n(2) the OSFs were operational  (or could have been made operational) , about \nwhich there is inconsistent evidence;11 and  \n(3) the OSFs were capable of servicing the Petrol Stations given their \ngeographic locatio n, although these two sets of assets were geographically \ndistributed across Ukraine in very different ways.  \n \n7  TA-JS, ¶ 7.18.  \n8  TA-JS, ¶ 7.17.  \n9  TA-JS, ¶ 7.17. I comment on the reliability of each set of volume data in Section 6.  \n10  BK2, ¶ 36. \n11  I discuss the operational status of the OSFs in more detail at ¶¶ 9.11  to 9.33 . \nD26/1/8\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 9 2.11 Given the inconsistent and/or unreliable nature of the available information about \nthe OSFs’ status, and the lack of any historical and expected fi nancial performance \nfor them, I value the OSFs by reference to the prices at which a subset of these \nassets were sold at auctions in 2019. In the absence of adequate information from \n2016 with which to perform a valuation, and in the absence of any reason to \nexpect the value of these assets to have changed materially between 2016 and \n2019, I consider that these auctions provide the best guide to the value of the \nOSFs as at 2016. In contrast, Mr Kaczmarek uses a DCF approach which relies on \nthe operational i nformation that the Bank (before its nationalisation) provided to \nBT, but which BT did not itself verify.  In particular, the operational information \nprovided to BT is contradicted by other documents I have reviewed, including a \nletter from the NBU to the B ank dated 2 July 2016 which states that at least some \nof the oil storage facilities transferred to the Bank had not been in working order \nfor a long time.  I consider that the subsequent auctions of OSFs indicate that Mr \nKaczmarek’s valuations are overstate d. \nOpinions for which Mr Kaczmarek provides no support  \n2.12 In some instances, Mr Kaczmarek expresses an opinion for which I do not consider \nthere to be any support.  \n2.13 Mr Kaczmarek comments on why EY qualified or did not qualify its audit opinions \nin respect of the fair value of the Transferred Assets in the Bank’s financial \nstatements in 2016, 2017 and 2018. These comments are relevant to the weight \nthat can be placed on EY’s audit opinions. I consider that these audit opinions \nindicate that the Original 2016 Va lues were materially overstated, because EY did \nnot issue an unqualified audit opinion on these values in 2016 but subsequently \nissued an unqualified audit opinion in respect of the Restated 2016 Values.12  \n2.14 There is nothing in  EY’s audit opinions  which pro vides any basis for Mr \nKaczmarek’s explanations .

In some cases, his explanations appear inconsistent \nwith EY’s actions and with opinions that Mr  Kaczmarek sets out elsewhere in his \nreports. In particular:13 \n(1) in Mr Kaczmarek’s First Report he suggests th at EY had sufficient evidence \nto issue an unqualified opinion in respect of the Original 2016 Values but \ndid not do so because it had insufficient time to complete its work. \nHowever: (i) EY’s audit opinion states that it did not have sufficient audit \nevide nce in support of the Original 2016 Values; and (ii) in 2018, EY did not \nqualify its opinion in respect of the Restated 2016 Values, which were \nmaterially lower than the Original 2016 Values, suggesting that EY \nconsidered the Original 2016 Values were unre liable; and  \n \n12  Although EY qualified its overall audit opinion in respect of other asp ects of the Bank’s \nfinancial statements.  \n13  I comment in more detail on EY’s audit opinions at ¶¶ 4.22  to 4.45 . \nD26/1/9\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 10 (2) in the TA Joint Statement , Mr Kaczmarek  introduced a further potential \nexplanation for EY’s qualified opinion on the Bank’s 31 December 2016 \nfinancial statements, stating that this may have been due to the Bank’s \nreliance on valuation repo rts produced during the second half of 2016, \nrather than commissioning new valuations as at 31  December 2016.14 \nHowever, this appears inconsistent with Mr Kaczmarek’s views that: (i)  EY \nhad sufficient audit evidence to issue an unqualified opinion; and (ii) the \ndifference in my valuation date of 1 July 2016 and his valuation date of \n31 December 2016 does not have “ any effect ” on our respective valuations, \nwhich appears to indicate that valuations performed at any date in the \nsecond half of 2016 may have been acceptable to EY.15  \n2.15 Mr Kaczmarek also comments on the nature of the work conducted by an auditor, \nwhich is a gain  relevant to the weight that can be placed on EY’s audit opinions. I \nconsider that Mr Kaczmarek understates the extent of review by an aud itor of \nvaluations contained in financial statements. Mr Kaczmarek does not support his \nviews with references to his experience of working with auditors or to audit \nstandards. Mr  Kaczmarek’s views are inconsistent with my own experience of: \n(i) reviewing v aluations produced for the purpose of audits; (ii) preparing reports \nfor use in financial statements which were subject to scrutiny by auditors; and \n(iii) being a member of an audit committee of a company reporting under IFRS. \nThey are also inconsistent wi th the content of the audit standards under which EY \nperformed its audit of the Bank’s financial statements.16 \n2.16 While Mr Kaczmarek places limited weight on EY’s audit opinions for the purposes \nof his work, he places significant weight on verification work h e states that the \nNBU carried out (or should have carried out) on valuations that it commissioned. \nFor all but one of the real estate assets, Mr  Kaczmarek relies on values obtained \nby the NBU (the “ NBU Values ”), even though : (i) he has not seen the underlying \nvaluation in all cases; (ii) little information is available about the provenance of \nthese values and the purpose for which they were used; and (iii)  there is no \nevidence of any verification work having been performed. Mr  Kaczmarek states \nthat “ the NBU would not merely have “received” valuation reports and would have \n(and should have) evaluated the information contained in them ”.17 However, he \nhas provided no evidence to support this view.18  \n \n14  TA-JS, ¶ 5.9. \n15  BK1, ¶ 18. \n16  I comment in more detail on the "}

In some cases we \ndraw very different conclusions from the same reference points. This is \nparticularly the case for our valuations of the Petrol Stations and applies to a \nlesser extent for the OSFs.  \n2.18 Mr Kaczmarek relies on transactions in petrol stations in other countries and on \nvaluations of petrol stations in Crimea that he conducted in prior arbitrations. I \ncons ider that this analysis is unreliable for the purposes of valuing the Petrol \nStations as at 2016 because:  \n(1) it does not account for differences between petrol stations which may have \na significant effect on their value, including the country in which the y are \nlocated, whether they are located in cities or villages, and their fuel sales \nvolumes. The evidence available suggests that the Petrol Stations that are \nthe subject of this litigation are likely to be less valuable than other petrol \nstations that Mr Kaczmarek considers;19 and \n(2) when relying on sales prices or valuations which are expressed in a currency \nother than UAH, I consider that it is necessary to take account of the \nsometimes very material changes  in exchange rates between the dates of \nthese transactions or valuations and our valuation dates in this litigation. \nMr Kaczmarek has not done so. I consider that this causes him to conclude \nthat these reference points support much higher valuations than they do.20   \nInternal consistency  \n2.19 Separate to t he matters identified above, some of Mr Kaczmarek’s opinions \nappear to be internally inconsistent or not responsive to his instructions. His \nrationale for some aspects of his valuations is therefore not clear to me and I am \nunable to respond (fully) to the m. \n2.20 First , Mr Kaczmarek’s views and approach on individual assets as regards the \nOriginal 2016 Values and the NBU Values is inconsistent with his instructions and \nbetween themselves (see Table 3-1). Mr Kaczmarek is instructed to assess \nwhether the Original 2016 Values comply with IFRS, but has instead assessed the \nreasonableness of the NBU Values (which are different). The implication of this is \nthat:  \n(1)  for the real e state assets, Mr Kaczmarek focusses on the NBU Values and \nadopts these values as his conclusion for most of these assets; and  \n \n19  I discuss this issue in Sections 7 and 8.  \n20  I discuss  this issue in Section 5.  \nD26/1/11\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 12 (2)  for the OSFs and Petrol Stations, he considers the Original 2016 Values \ncomply with IFRS but performs his own valuation rega rdless and does not \nadopt the Original 2016 Values (or NBU Values, which are available for \nsome but not all of these assets).  \n2.21 Second , Mr Kaczmarek adopts an inconsistent approach as regards the weight \n"}

He relies on EY’s valuation conclusions in respect of the OSFs, \nconsidering that they support his own conclusions (although I disagree) but does \nnot refer to EY’s conclusions in respect of Petrol Stations, which are much low er \nthan his own.  \n2.22 Third , Mr Kaczmarek has adopted my valuation of Hotel Zirka, stating that he \nconsiders my “ methodology and assumptions to be reasonable ”.21 This valuation \nadopts the same country risk premium ( CRP) that I apply in respect of the Petrol \nStations. However, when valuing the Petrol Stations and the OSFs Mr Kaczmarek \nproposes a much lower CRP which would have resulted in a materially different \nvalue of Hotel Zirka. This lower CRP is significantly below the CRPs used by valuers \nof other assets i n Ukraine, including the valuers of the Petrol Stations and OSFs, \nand I consider it inappropriate.  \nMr Kaczmarek’s instructions (Section 3)  \n2.23 Mr Kaczmarek is instructed to assess whether the values of the Transferred Assets \nreported in the Bank’s audited fin ancial statements as at 31 December 2016 (the \nOriginal 2016 Values) were in accordance with the Bank’s financial reporting \nstandards, being International Financial Reporting Standards (“ IFRS ”). I have \ninstead been instructed to assess the market value of t hese assets at the time \nthey were transferred to the Bank, which for convenience I assume to have \nhappened on 1 July 2016.    \n2.24 Our respective instructions therefore differ in three main respects, which I discuss \nin detail in Section 3 .  \n2.25 First , Mr Kaczmarek is instructed to assess the reasonableness of certain values \nrather than to perform his own valuations, except that he is instructed to perform \nhis own valuation where he concludes the Original 2016 Values were not \ncompliant with IFRS. Mr Kaczmar ek appears to consider that a very wide range of \nvaluations can be considered reasonable under IFRS.  \n \n21  BK1, ¶ 215.  \nD26/1/12\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 13 2.26 Mr Kaczmarek’s work does not, however, appear to be in line with this \ninstruction:  \n(1) while he has stated in the TA Joint Statement that the Original 2016 Values \nof the Petrol Stations and OSFs were reasonable,22 in his reports he \npresented his own (materially different) valuations of these assets  (his own \nvaluations of these assets are 33% higher and 58% lower than the Original \n2016 Values res pectively) . I am unclear why he did so if he considered the \nOriginal 2016 Values were reasonable, given his instructions; and  \n(2) in contrast, when considering the real estate assets:  \n(a) he suggests that where he concludes the contemporaneous \nvaluations w ere reasonable it is unnecessary to perform his own \nvaluations;23 although  \n(b) the contemporaneous valuations he considers for these purposes are \nnot the Original 2016 Values he is instructed to consider, but the NBU \nValues .  \n2.27 Second , Mr Kaczmarek conducts his valuations as at 31 December 2016 while I \nconduct mine as at 1 July 2016. Mr Kaczmarek does not consider that this \ndifference has any effect.24 I agree this difference in valuation date is not material \nfor the real estate assets, but I consider that it  acts to increase Mr Kaczmarek’s \nvaluation of the Petrol Stations and OSFs relative to mine. This is because \nMr Kaczmarek considers (although I disagree) that t"}

This is because \nMr Kaczmarek considers (although I disagree) that these assets should be valued \nin USD rather than UAH, and the USD strengthened appreciably agains t the UAH \nbetween our respective valuation dates such that, all else equal, Mr Kaczmarek’s \nvaluation is increased 9% relative to mine .  \n2.28 Third , I am instructed to assess the “market value” of the assets I consider, \nwhereas Mr Kaczmarek considers their “fair  value”. Mr Kaczmarek asserts that \nmarket value, the standard of value I am instructed to apply, is “ not a relevant \nstandard of value in this case ”.25 I consider that the appropriate standard of value \nis a matter for the Court . I note, however, that the Fi rst Defendant has instructed \nanother of his experts to perform valuations of certain Transferred Assets using \nthe market value standard.26 I have seen no explanation for why it is appropriate \nto use different standards of value when valuing different Trans ferred Assets.  \n \n22  TA-JS, ¶ 3.3.  \n23  BK1, ¶ 158.  \n24  BK1, ¶ 18. \n25  TA-JS, ¶ 4.2. \n26  Mr Seymour’s First Report , ¶¶ 2.1  and 7.1. \nD26/1/13\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 14 2.29 Mr Kaczmarek and I appear to disagree about: (i) the differences between the \nmarket value and fair value standards of value; and (ii) the implications of this as \nregards the appropriateness of the income and cost approaches to valuation in \ndifferent circumstances. This disagreement does not appear to be a material \ndriver of the differences between us in respect of the assets that I consider in this \nreport , but I address it in Appendix 3  for completeness. Mr Kaczmarek considers \nthat fair valu e is more prescriptive than market value and that it places greater \nweight than the market value standard on the cost approach  (i.e. valuing the asset \nby reference to the amount it would cost to replace) , but presents no documents \nin support of this view. This does not accord with my experience. It is also \ncounterintuitive because both standards of value are, as Mr Kaczmarek and I \nagree, very similar. One would not, therefore, expect the choice of standard to \nconstrain the  valuation methodologies available to the valuer  – not least as this \nwill turn on the facts in each valuation, including as regards the available \ninformation to use in a given methodology.  \nEY’s position as auditor and author of the EY Report (Section 4)  \n2.30 EY assessed the value of the Bank’s assets in two capacities: (i) as auditor of the \nBank’s financial statements from 2016 onwards; and (ii) as author of the EY \nReport, which was a separate non -audit engagement in which EY reviewed \nvaluations of certain assets. Mr Kaczmarek and I interpret EY ’s work differently, \nand therefore attach differing levels of importance to its conclusions.  \nEY’s audit opinions  \n2.31 I consider that EY’s audit opinions provide evidence of the relative weight to be \nafforded to the Original 2016 Values and the Restated 2016 V alues. In particular, \nEY issued a qualified audit opinion in respect of the Original 2016 Values, stating \nthat it was unable to obtain sufficient audit evidence to form a view on these \nvalues. In contrast, it did not qualify its opinion in respect of the R estated 2016 \nValues which formed part of the Bank’s 2018 financial statements.  \n2.32 Mr Kaczmarek appears to disagree with the weight I place on EY’s audit opinions \nfor two reasons.  \nD26/1/14\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Beza"}

He suggests that an audit should only include \nchecks of the mechanical accuracy of calculations and checks of objective \n(referred to by Mr Kaczmarek as ‘observable’) input assumptions, and that it is not \nan auditor’ s role to question subjective (referred to by Mr Kaczmarek as \n‘unobservable’) inputs decided by management. In Section 4  I discuss the audit \nprocess based on both: (i) my own experience of audit and valuations considered \nin the context of an audit (having worked as a partner at two leading international \naccounting firms and as a non -executive director who sat on the audit committee \nof a Belgian company which prepared financial statements prepared under IFRS); \nand (ii) the content of the audit standa rds which applied to EY’s audit  of the \nBank ’s financial statements . I explain that, contrary to Mr  Kaczmarek’s \nsuggestions, auditors are required to assess the reasonableness of all input \nassumptions (whether observable or unobservable). This would have en tailed \nestablishing whether inputs fell within a reasonable range in isolation, and also \nwhether the combination of those inputs produced a reasonable overall \nvaluation.  \n2.34 Second , Mr Kaczmarek appears to place less weight than me on EY’s audit \nopinions spec ifically. He states that he disagrees with EY’s stated reason for \nqualifying its 2016 audit opinion. EY stated that it was unable to obtain sufficient \naudit evidence to support the Original 2016 Values . Conversely, Mr Kaczmarek \nconcludes that EY did have a ccess to sufficient evidence  but did not have enough \ntime to conduct the audit due to the recent nationalisation of the Bank. I have \nseen no evidence of this, and note that EY continued to qualify its opinion in \nrespect of the asset values in 2017. It was only in 2018 when the Bank restated \nthe 2016 asset values that EY did not qualify its opinion in respect of the 2016 \nasset values.  \n2.35 Mr Kaczmarek also states that EY may have qualified its 2016 audit opinion \nbecause EY did not have fair valuation calculatio ns underlying the assets as of \n31 December 2016. Mr Kaczmarek presents no evidence to support this, and his \nexplanation appears contrary to his view that: (i) EY had all the necessary \ninformation to express an unqualified opinion; and (ii) the difference b etween a \n1 July 2016 and 31 December 2016 valuation date has no material effect on the \nvaluations of the Transferred Assets.  \nD26/1/15\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 16 The EY Report  \n2.36 I also consider that the EY Report is relevant to my work. In this report, EY \ncommented on various valuation reports  relating to the Transferred Assets and, in \nsome cases, presented adjusted versions of these valuations. EY’s conclusions \nindicate that the Original 2016 Values were significantly overstated for all of the \nasset types it considered,27 including the subset of 228 of the 246 Petrol Stations it \nconsidered and three of the four real estate assets it considered. It is not possible \nto compare directly EY’s conclusions on the OSFs to the Original 2016 Values as \nthe EY Report does not specify the individual OSFs it  reviewed.

However, in \ngeneral EY appeared to prefer lower OSF values than the Original 2016 Values.  \n2.37 Again, Mr Kaczmarek places less weight on EY’s work than I do. Where EY \nadjusted a valuation assumption that Mr Kaczmarek considers to be a matter of \njudgm ent, he states that the adjustments are “best characterized as matters upon \nwhich reasonable valuation professionals can reasonably disagree ”.28 In my view, \nto assess whether a valuation is reasonable, it is necessary to consider the \nreasonableness of both objective/observable and subjective/unobservable \nassumptions made in arriving at the valuation. Some of EY’s adjustments to the \nvaluations that  it reviewed were material, indicating the importance of the \nassumptions being reviewed.   \n2.38 Further, as explained above, Mr Kaczmarek appears to be inconsistent in his \nreliance on this document , relying on it to support his OSF valuation s (although I \ndisagr ee with the comfort that Mr Kaczmarek draws from this comparison) but \nnot referring to it in the context of his valuation of the Petrol Stations, where his \nconclusions differ markedly from EY’s.  \nPreliminary comments on the Petrol Stations and OSFs (Sectio n 5) \n2.39 Mr Kaczmarek makes some comments that apply to both the Petrol Stations and \nOSFs. In Section 5 I respond to three such points.  \n2.40 First , Mr Kaczmarek considers that the Petrol Stations and OSFs should be valued \nin USD, whereas I consider it more appropriate to value them in UAH. \nMr Kaczmarek justifies his approach on the basis that the prices of oil and related \nproducts are quoted in USD.  I do not consider that this justifies his view that the \nvalue of a Ukrainian -based petrol station or oil storage facility is more likely to \nhold steady in USD terms than UAH over time because:  \n \n27  I set out f urther details of EY’s review in MB1 -TA, Appendix 4.  \n28  TA-JS, ¶ 5.2. \nD26/1/16\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 17 (1) Mr Kaczmarek’s view would require that, following a mater ial weakening of \nthe UAH against the USD, Ukrainian citizens would be willing to pay more \nfor petrol in UAH terms (including in respect of the petrol station mark -up \nas well as the element of the price relating to raw materials). As I explain \nfurther below  (see paragraph 2.58 ), there was a significant  weakening of \nthe UAH against the USD between 2012 and 2016,29 which I consider means \nUkrainian businesses in general a re unlikely to have held their value in USD \nover this period;  \n(2)  the currency in which the Petrol Stations and OSFs earned their revenue \nand paid their operating costs was UAH;  \n(3)  the consideration in the majority of the petrol station transactions w hich \nMr Kaczmarek has identified was reported in local currency rather than \nUSD; and  \n(4) the available contemporaneous valuations of the Petrol Stations and OSFs \nwere almost all performed in UAH.30 \n2.41 Second , Mr Kaczmarek considers that the Bank does not appe ar to have managed \nthe Petrol Stations and OSFs after their transfer. He identifies that their value in \nthe Bank’s financial statements appears to have significantly reduced by 2018 and \nsuggests that a lack of management may explain why: (i) the value of a ssets in \n2018 was significantly below the Original 2016 Values; and (ii) 71 of the 72 OSFs \nwere not operational in 2019.

Consistent with this, there is \nevidence from as early as July 2016 that some of the OSFs were not operational. I \nunderstand that it is the Ba nk’s case that shortly after transfer to the Bank, the \nPetrol Stations and OSFs were leased to companies owned or controlled by the \nFirst Defendant and/or the Second Defendant ,31 and the Bank’s financial \nstatements indicate that after transfer the assets w ere expected to be managed \nby their previous owners as part of the wider Privat Group.32 \n \n29  For example, a s I explain in Section 5, the UAH depreciated by over 3x between the end of \n2013  and 2016, from 7.99  UAH/USD to 27.19 UAH/USD.

I agree with Mr Kaczmarek that, in \nprinciple, va luations should be based on information known or knowable as at the \nvaluation date. However, where there are doubts regarding the reliability of \ncontemporaneous information, it is appropriate to rely on information from after \nthe valuation date t hat is inf ormative of the situation at the valuation \ndate.33 There are doubts as to the reliability of information available to me around \nthe valuation date regarding the Petrol Station volumes and operational status of \nthe OSFs, with the information and assumptions underlying the Original 2016 \nValues being inconsistent a nd potentially unreliable. This is information which \nshould have been knowable by a potential buyer and seller at the valuation date. \nTherefore, I have used, and consider it reasonable to rely on, information from \nafter the valuation date  that reflects inf ormation  that would been available as at \nthe valuation date.  \nPetrol Stations (Section 6 to 8)  \n2.43 When valuing the Petrol Stations, Mr Kaczmarek performs his own valuation using \na DCF approach and a comparable transactions approach. He applies a 50/50 \nweightin g to the results of these two approaches and cross -checks his conclusions \nusing awards from two (related) previous arbitrations  in which he was involved.  \nThe previous arbitrations considered  petrol stations in Crimea owned by Ukrnafta \n(the “ Ukrnafta Arbitr ation ”) and LLC Stabil and others (the “ Stabil Arbitration ”, \ntogether the “ Crimean Arbitrations ”). \nDCF (Section 6)  \n2.44 Although I agree that a DCF approach is a suitable method to value the Petrol \nStations, Mr Kaczmarek’s and my own DCF valuations give very di fferent values.

[2] The effect of each \ndifference shown is calculated assuming that the differenc es are adjusted for in \nthe order presented.  \n2.46 I disagree with Mr Kaczmarek’s approach in all three areas.   \n2.47 First , there is evidence that the volumes underlying the Original 2016 Values \n(which Mr Kaczmarek adopts) are overstated. Mr Kaczmarek has not commen ted \non any of this evidence, which I presented in my First Report. In particular:  \n(1) the historical volumes provided to the valuers who prepared the Original PS \nReports should have been identical. However, the historical volumes \npresented in the BT Origi nal PS Report differ to those presented in the UCE \nand Veritas Original PS Reports. I was able to show this for 14 Petrol \nStations at the time of my First Report (based on the data disclosed at that \ndate). Mr Kaczmarek did not comment on this in his report , and described \nmy views as an “ over -reaction ” in the TA Joint Statement.34 Since my First \nReport,  I have been provided with  additional information including: \n(i) reports of the monthly fuel  sales  volumes underlying the UCE and Veritas \nOriginal PS Report s; and (ii) the fuel  sales  volumes underlying the BT \nOriginal PS Report. Mr  Kaczmarek considers that the monthly data provided \nto UCE and Veritas is “sufficiently detailed ” that any overstatement of  these \nvolumes is unlikely.35 However, a comparison of this information with that \n \n34  TA-JS, ¶ 7.17.  \n35  TA-JS, ¶ 7.18.  \n0123456789\nMr Bezant Factual\nassumptions\nabout\nvolumesRONIC\nadjustmentDiscount rate\nadjustmentOther Mr Kaczmarek\nD26/1/19\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 20 used in the BT Original PS Report, which is equally detailed, shows that the \nvolumes (both by type of fuel and in total) differ for all 243 of the Petrol \nStations for which I  am able to compare these statistics (being 99% of the \ntotal of 246 Petrol Stations). This demonstrates  that at least  one set of data \nis unreliable;36   \n(2) EY, in its role as auditor, concluded in 2016 that it did not have sufficient \nevidence to support t he Original 2016 Values, which included values of the \nPetrol Stations based on the Original PS Reports. EY did not later qualify its \nopinion in respect of the lower valuations contained in the Restated PS \nReports, which indicates that EY considered the vol ume assumptions (which \nare the principal driver of value) applied in the latter reports were more \nreliable than those in the former;  \n(3) all seven valuers who valued the Petrol Stations subsequent to 2016 \ndisregarded the volumes underpinning the Veritas an d UCE Original PS \nReports, or adjusted these volumes downwards; and  \n(4) my cross -checks of petroleum volumes using "}

If a company is achieving a RONIC gr eater than its cost of \ncapital, this implies it is achieving returns in excess of the returns required given \nthe risks of the investment in question. In a competitive industry, in the long run, \ncompetition or regulation will act to eliminate or constrain t hese excess profits. \nMr Kaczmarek mischaracterises RONIC as a “ capital budgeting tool ”. My use of \nRONIC is consistent with its use as described in standard valuation textbooks.  \n2.50 Mr Kaczmarek considers that petrol stations are able to sustain excess profits in \nthe long run due to a first mover advantage and their location. He has not \nexplained how these factors apply to the Petrol Stations we are instructed to \nvalue, which I consider do not benefit from any first mover advantage, and are \ntypically in rural lo cations where I would expect limited demand. I consider it \nunlikely that the Petrol Stations will possess any competitive advantage in the \nlong run.  \n \n36  There is no discernible systematic difference between the two sets of volumes, other than \na general trend that the BT O riginal PS Report is based on higher diesel volumes (and \nlower volumes of other types of fuel) than the UCE and Veritas Original PS Reports.  \nD26/1/20\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 21 2.51 I have therefore assumed a long -term RONIC equal to the cost of capital plus 1% \n(which may overstate the va lue of the Petrol Stations as most companies are \nunlikely to attract any premium). For presentational purposes , I have applied this \nadjustment through increasing capital expenditure in the explicit period.   \n2.52 Third , I assess the CRP to be 7.6% based on the s overeign yield spread of \nUkrainian government bonds in March 2016, as published by Duff & Phelps , a \nglobal valuation and corporate financial advisor  and frequently used source for \nCRPs .37 Mr Kaczmarek concludes on a CRP of 3% based on his qualitative analy sis \nof various components of country risk, including currency, macroeconomic and \nsocial risks. I consider that Mr Kaczmarek’s CRP assessment is understated \nbecause he does not account for some key categories of risk in his assessment \nsuch as political, leg al, and regulatory risks.  \n2.53 Mr Kaczmarek’s assessment is also inappropriate because: (i)  it is purely \nqualitative , i.e., it relies on no quantitative measures of country risk. Such \nquantitative measures are frequently used by valuers to inform CRP assessmen ts; \n(ii) it is inconsistent with his discussion of country risk in prior cases where he \nrefers to political, legal and regulatory risks as being contributory elements of \ncountry risk; (iii)  it assumes that petrol stations have limited exposure to country \nrisk compared to other companies, with which I disagree because petrol stations \nare immovable physical assets; and (iv) it results in a CRP significantly below all \nother estimates of Ukrainian country risk I have reviewed, and as used by other \nvaluers of th e Petrol Stations and Ukrainian assets more generally.  \nMarket"}

He estimates a value per petrol \nstation from these t ransactions, and applies it to the full portfolio of Petrol \nStations. Mr Kaczmarek’s concluded value is based on: (i) the mid -point of the \nweighted average (by number of petrol stations) and simple average price per \npetrol station;38 which (ii) is similar to the price per petrol station implied by an \nApril 2015 transaction between Open Joint Stock Company Oil company Lukoil \n(“Lukoil ”) and AMIC Energy Management GmbH (“ AMIC ”) on which he places \nadditional weight.39 \n2.55 I disagree with Mr K aczmarek’s application of the market approach and do not \nconsider it appropriate to rely on this approach other than as a cross -check in this \ninstance.   \n \n37  MB1 -TA, footnote 466.  \n38  Mr Kaczmarek’s transactions analysis results in a weighted average price per petrol station \nof USD 1.1m and a simple average of USD 1.6m.  \n39  The implied price per petrol station from the Lukoil /AMIC transaction is USD 1.25m.  \nD26/1/21\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 22 2.56 First , none of the contemporaneous valuers relied on a valuation of the Petrol \nStations using a market  approach. For example, Veritas described the application \nof the approach to value Ukrainian petrol stations as “ virtually impossible ”.40 \n2.57 Second , the simple average price per petrol station is distorted by transactions for \na single or only a few petrol stations ( six transactions involve five petrol stations \nor fewer),41 demonstrated by the simple average price being 45% higher than the \nweighted average price.42 I consider that the weighted average is a more relevant \nstatistic.43  \n2.58 Third , Mr Kaczmar ek overstates his valu ation  by assuming that the Petrol Stations \nhold their value in USD terms, and not accounting for the significant depreciation \nof the UAH against the USD over the period since the transactions he relies upon. I \nconsider this to be inco rrect, not least considering that significant currency \ndepreciation is usually a sign of wider economic difficulty which likely means the \nvalue of the Petrol Stations (and Ukrainian businesses more generally) will have \ndeclined . Adjusting for this alone so  that the price of each transaction is converted \nto UAH at the time of the transaction:  \n(1) the weighted average price from Mr  Kaczmarek’s transactions decreases by \n38% from UAH 29. 9m per petrol station to UAH 18.5 m; and  \n(2) the price implied by Mr Kaczmar ek’s preferred transaction between Lukoil \nand AIMC (which as I explain below provides an upper bound on the value \nof the Petrol Stations) decreases by 23% from UAH 34.0m to UAH 26.3m.  \n2.59 Fourth , in any event, Mr Kaczmarek overstates his valu ation  by not adjus ting the \nprices paid in  his comparable transactions for differences between the petrol \nstations involved in his transactions and the Petrol Stations we are instructed to \nvalue. He has ignored key factors which affect demand for fuel, including: \n(i) locatio n; (ii) size, facilities and standard of the typical petrol station in the \ncountry in question; (iii) prevailing macroeconomic conditions; (iv) whether \nstandard or premium fuel is sold ; and (v) market dynamics , including the oil price \nand level of competit ion.  \n \n40  Veritas Original PS Rep"}

In particular, the available information indicates \nthat the petrol stations acquired in the Lukoil/AMIC transaction sell higher \nvolumes than the Petrol Statio ns, and operate under a ‘premium’ brand, unlike \nthe Petrol Stations. This implies that they are more valuable than the Petrol \nStations, all else equal, and hence relying on this transaction will overvalue the \nPetrol Stations.  \nCross -check based on the Crim ean Arbitrations ( Section 8)  \n2.61 Mr Kaczmarek cross -checks his valuations of the Petrol Stations against the results \nof his previous valuations in the Crimean Arbitrations , in which he valued petrol \nstations in Crimea in 2014. I do not consider that Mr Kaczmar ek’s cross -check can \nbe used to validate the results of his assessment. I explain this in Section  8. \n2.62 Mr Kaczmarek explains that he was instructed in the Crimean Arbitrations to value \n47 petrol stations and two oil storage facilities. The tribunal in these arbitrations \nconcluded on a value per petrol station of USD  1.1m and USD  2.8m  for each of the \ntwo sets of petrol stations that it considered .  \n2.63 Mr Kaczmarek considers that the tribunal’s award in these arbitrations \ndemonstrates the reasonableness of his val uations in the current litigation. I do \nnot consider that Mr Kaczmarek has provided sufficient information for me to \ndetermine if the award in these arbitrations is informative for valuing the Petrol \nStations. Nonetheless, I have considered the information  that is available as far as \nI am able to do so.  \n2.64 I disagree with Mr Kaczmarek’s reliance on these previous valuations for three \nreasons.  \n2.65 First , Mr Kaczmarek compares the tribunal’s conclusion as at 22 April 2014 (the \ndate of valuation in that case), expr essed in USD, with his own valuation as at \n31 December 2016, also expressed in USD. I consider that the value of petrol \nstations in Ukraine is likely to have fallen in USD terms between 2014 and 2016 \ndue to a significant weakening of the UAH against the US D.  \n2.66 It is more appropriate to compare Mr Kaczmarek’s valuation to the tribunal’s \naward after converting each amount to UAH at the exchange rate prevailing on \nthe relevant date. The result of such a comparison will be very different to \nMr Kaczmarek’s compar ison performed in USD terms as the UAH weakened \nagainst the USD from 11.2 UAH/USD on 22 April 2014 to 27.2 UAH/USD on \n31 December 2016. By not accounting for this change in exchange rates, \nMr Kaczmarek’s approach assumes that the UAH value of the Petrol St ations as at \nDecember 2016 was 2.4 times  that as at April 2014.

Mr  Kaczmarek has not \naccounted for any such differences in his analysis.  \n2.68 Third , Mr Kaczmarek valued the Crimean p etrol stations using assumptions \nrelating to Russia rather than Ukraine. As at 2014, I would have expected a petrol \nstation in Russia to be more valuable than a petrol station in Ukraine with \notherwise identical characteristics because: (i)  forecasts of gr owth in petrol sales \nvolumes were lower in Ukraine than Russia; and (ii) a Ukrainian petrol station \nwould have been exposed to higher country risk than a Russian petrol station, as \nevidenced by country risk statistics for the two countries.   \n2.69 After adjusti ng Mr Kaczmarek’s valuation of the petrol stations in the Crimean \nArbitrations to reflect some of the differences (where possible) between the \nCrimean petrol stations and those that are the subject of this litigation, and \nbefore adopting any separate downw ards adjustments applied by the tribunal, \nthe valuation supports my valuation of the Petrol Stations but not \nMr Kaczmarek’s. I set out the adjustments that I make in Section 8 . The adjusted \nvalues per Petrol Station of between c. UAH 6. 1m and UAH 9.9m are similar to my \naverage value of UAH 7.6m in the current proceedings, and significantly below \nMr Kaczmarek’s assessment of UAH 35m.  \nOSFs (Section 9)  \n2.70 In our first reports, Mr Kaczmarek and I were instructed to value 72 OSFs. In this \nreport I am instructed to value an additional two OSFs. I use the same method for \nvaluing these two additional OSFs as I did for the 72 OSFs I valued in my First \nReport, which is to: (i) use the transaction prices to value the OSFs sold at auction \nin 2019; and (ii) apply the price per unit capacity implied by these sales (after an \nuplift calculated by comparing the value per unit of capacity of those OSFs sold at \nauction in 2019 with the remaining OSFs) to the remaining OSFs. I explain my \nvaluation of these additional two OSFs in Appendix 7 .  \nMr Kaczmarek’s comments on my analysis  \n2.71 Mr Kaczmarek’s two main criticisms  of my approach to valuing the OSFs relate to: \n(i) the possibility that the values of the OSFs may have changed between 2016 and \n2019; and (ii) my use of hindsight.  \nD26/1/24\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 25 2.72 First , Mr Kaczmarek appears to consider that the operational status of the OSFs \nmay have changed between 2016 and 2019. He suggests that if the OSFs were not \noperational in 2019, then the auction sale s prices “ would reflect distressed asset \nvalues ”. In my opinio n, it is not necessarily the case that auction sale prices \n“would reflect distressed asset values ” if the OSFs sold by auction in 2019 were \nnot operational. The auction sale prices would, however, reflect the condition and \nstatus of each asset sold, includ ing whether its highest and best use was as an \noperational OSF or as an alternative use.

The auction sale prices would, however, reflect the condition and \nstatus of each asset sold, includ ing whether its highest and best use was as an \noperational OSF or as an alternative use. As I explained in my First Report, my \nreview of the market conditions for oil storage between 2016 and 2019 suggests \nthat there is no evidence of a fundamental change in the value of oil storage \nbusinesses between my valuation date and the auction dates in 2019. I therefore \nassume that the OSFs’ values did not change significantly over this period.44 \n2.73 Second , Mr Kaczmarek considers that the use of hindsight in using auction prices \nin 2019 that were not known or knowable as at 2016 renders my valuation of the \nOSFs non -compliant with valuation guidelines. I consider my approach \nappropriate and reasonable in the  circumstances. There are several indicators \nthat there is uncertainty about the operational status of the OSFs, including that \nthe data on operational status of the OSFs contained in the BT OSF Report (the \nonly contemporaneous valuation) may be unreliable . BT stated that it did not \nverify the data it relied upon and as such I do not consider BT’s use of that data \nendorses or validates it. In the absence of reliable information on the operational \nstatus of the OSFs, I do not consider it possible to  value reliably  the OSFs relying \nonly on information documented as at 2016.  \nMr Kaczmarek’s DCF  \n2.74 Mr Kaczmarek values the OSFs using the DCF approach. I discuss Mr Kaczmarek’s \nvaluation of the OSFs further in Section 9 . I explain below that:  \n(1)  Mr Kaczmarek’s valuation is inconsistent with the auction sales prices of the \nsubset of OSFs sold in 2019;   \n(2)  his valuation relies on  the throughput data contained in the BT OSF Report, \nwhen there is evidence that this is not reliable (as it implies that the \nmajority of the OSFs were operational at the time of transfer);  \n(3)  I disagree with assumptions on  which Mr Kaczmarek’s DCF calculation is \nbased; and  \n(4)  Mr Kaczmarek’s cross -check of his valuation result is selective.  \n \n44  I review this by reference to the market capitalisation and valuation multiples implied by \nlisted companies that operate OSFs in Eu ropean countries.

This \nwas not the case as: (i) the OSFs are only a subset of the 120 oil storage \nfacilities that appear to have been transferred to the Bank; and (ii) the 72 \nOSFs and 246 Petrol Stations are also only a s ubset of the Privat Group’s c. \n1,000 petrol stations and c. 150 oil storage facilities. I have seen no \nevidence that the transferred Petrol Stations have historically been serviced \nby the transferred OSFs, rather than other oil storage facilities either \ncontrolled by the Privat Group or by third parties; and  \n(3) Mr Kaczmarek concludes it would not be rational to pay for other storage \noptions given the Bank’s ownership of the OSFs. However, this presupposes \nas a practical matter that these OSFs could have be en used, without \ndemonstrating that these OSFs were operational or appropriately located.  \n2.79 Mr Kaczmarek states that “ the only information in the record concerning the \noperational status of each OSF in 2016 is that which was provided to Baker Tilly to \nvalue  the OSFs in 2016 ”.45 This is incorrect.  \n \n45  BK2, ¶ 104.  \nD26/1/26\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 27 2.80 Mr Kaczmarek and I agree that BT did not verify the operational status of the OSFs \nor the information provided to it by the Bank. Other documents that \nMr Kaczmarek and I have reviewed contradict his assumption that  68 of the 72 \nOSFs were operational as at his valuation date of 31 December 2016:  \n(1) internal Bank documents indicate that inspections of at least 31 OSFs we \nvalue had been conducted before or around March 2017, and state that at \nleast 28 of these OSFs we re not operational (with at least 12 requiring \nremedial works to return them to operation); and  \n(2) the Veritas OSF Report values eight OSFs relevant to my valuation (of the \ninitial 72 OSFs and two additional OSFs), and states that four of these OSFs \nwere operational and four were non -operational (though they were ready \nfor operation without remedial works). This contradicts the BT OSF Report \nwhich shows a positive throughput volume in 2015 for all eight of these \nOSFs.  \nMr Kaczmarek’s DCF assumptions  \n2.81 Mr Kac zmarek applies a DCF approach to value the OSFs. As I explained in my First \nReport, I do not consider this a reasonable valuation approach for the OSFs due \nto: (i) the uncertainty regarding their operational status; and (ii) the lack of \navailable informati on regarding the historical and future financial performance of \nthe OSFs.  \n2.82 Notwithstanding that I do not consider that a DCF approach is appropriate, I \ndisagree with three aspects of Mr Kaczmarek’s DCF valuation which act to \noverstate his valuation.  \n2.83 First , Mr Kaczmarek’s revenue assumptions are based on throughput volumes set \nout in the BT OSF Report for 11 months of 2015. As explained above, the \noperational status of the OSFs implied by these throughput volumes is \ncontradicted by other documents I have re viewed. Therefore, I consider the \nthroughput volumes set out in the BT OSF Report are also unreliable.  \n2.84 Second , as with our valuation of the Petrol Stations, Mr Kaczmarek adopts a CRP \nof 3.0%, while I adopt a CRP of 7.6%.

I explain why I consider my CRP is  more \nappropriate in Section 6.  \n2.85 Third , Mr Kaczmarek adopts three assumptions from his valuation of two oil \nstorage facilities in the Stabil Arbitration . These assumptions are: (i) a storage fee; \n(ii) an EBITDA margin; and (iii) annual maintenance capex (e xpressed as a \npercentage of storage revenues).  \nD26/1/27\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 28 2.86 For item (i), Mr Kaczmarek provided further support in the form of “ a survey of \nUkrainian storage facilities conducted by [the claimant s in the Stabil  \nArbitration]”.46 This survey contains incomplete information of the details of the \nentities surveyed. I have not been provided with information on the methodology \nused to select the samples chosen for the survey, or with information on the \nlocation and address of the faci lities relevant to the survey (other than the region \nin which the facilities appear to be located ). I am therefore unable to comment on \nwhether the storage fees indicated in the results of the survey are relevant or \ncomparable to the OSFs.  \n2.87 For items (ii) a nd (iii), Mr Kaczmarek states that he was provided with historical \nfinancial data for the two oil storage facilities he valued in the Stabil A rbitration \nwhich support s his assumptions. However, I do not know the characteristics of the \nfacilities he valued in that arbitration and so cannot assess the appropriateness of \nthese assumptions to value the OSFs.  \nMr Kaczmarek’s cross -checks  \n2.88 Mr Kaczmarek cross -checks his DCF valuation of the OSFs to four other sources.  \n2.89 First , Mr Kaczmarek compares his valuation aga inst a comparable transaction \nmultiple from the BT OSF Report. This would only be a relevant comparable if the \noil storage facilities involved in the transactions used to derive the multiple were \nsufficiently comparable to the OSFs I am instructed to value  (or the multiple had \nbeen appropriately adjusted for any differences). It is unclear whether these \nassets were comparable in terms of, for instance, their operational status.  Putting \naside the appropriateness of BT’s assumptions about the operational stat us of the \nOSFs,  BT made technical adjustments to the multiples for various characteristics \n(which I set out in Section 9) but I am unable to evaluate these adjustments as it \nwould require technical understanding which is outside of my expertise.  I note  \nMr Kaczmarek did not attempt to evaluate these adjustments.  \n2.90 In comparing the BT OSF Report comparable transaction to his own valuation, \nMr Kaczmarek also did not account for the change in the UAH/USD exchange rate \nbetween the date of the transaction (December  2015) and the date of his \nvaluation (31 December 2016).47 This would act to decrease the value of Ukrainian \noil storage  facilities  as at December 2016 relative to December 2015 when \nexpressed in USD.  \n \n46  The claimants in the Stabil  Arbitration are Stabil LLC, Rubenor LLC, Rustel LLC, Novel -Estate \nLLC, PII Kirovograd -Nafta LLC, Crimea -Petrol LLC, Pirsan LLC, Trade -Trust LLC, Elefteria L LC, \nVKF Satek LLC and Stemv Group LLC.

Given the uncertainty surrounding the operational status \nof the OSFs, I do not consider th e application of Professor Damodaran’s multiple is \nof any utility as a cross -check to the value of non -operational OSFs.  \n2.94 Fourth , Mr Kaczmarek compares his OSF valuation against the EY Report and the \nNBU Values, observing that the difference between his valuation and the Original \n2016 Values is similar to the difference in EY/NBU Values and the Original 2016 \nValues.

Further:  \n(1) it is not possible to compare directly the amounts assessed by EY to \nMr Kaczmarek’s concluded values for the 72 OSFs becaus e EY does not \nprovide its values on an asset -by-asset basis ; and  \n(2) it is not clear how EY derived the ‘adjusted values’ which it presents in its \nreport.  \n2.95 The NBU Values are based on the Veritas OSF Report, which applies a \ncomparables approach . As with th e comparables in the BT OSF Report, it is \nunclear whether these assets were comparable in terms  of, for instance, their \noperational status . Veritas made technical adjustments to the multiples for \nvarious characteristics (which I set out in Appendix 7)  but, as explained above, I \nam unable to evaluate these adjustments as it requires technical understanding \noutside of my expertise.  \nD26/1/29\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 30 Real estate assets (Section 10)  \n2.96 Mr Kaczmarek relies on the NBU Values for all of the real estate assets except: \n(i) Hotel Zirka,  where Mr Kaczmarek agrees with my conclusions in my First Report \nthat there are errors in the analysis underlying the NBU Value; and (ii)  Hotel Mir, \nwhere the NBU did not adopt a value in 2016.

We have very limited information on what the NBU’s ‘verification’ \ninvolved, and the NBU Values are not consistent with the values ascribed to the \nreal estate assets in the Bank’s financial statements either before or after \nrestatement. The EY Report appears to describe the work undertaken by the NBU \nas consisting of obtaining valuations performed by third parties. Mr Kaczmarek is \nof the view that “ the NBU would not merely have “received” valuation reports and \nwould have (and sh ould have) evaluated the information contained in them”,48 but \nprovides no support for this view.  \n2.99 Second , of the four real estate assets I have been instructed to value, I have seen \nthe analysis underlying two of the NBU Values (Hotel Mir and the Dnipro O ffice). \nIn both instances the report is flawed.

Mr Kaczmarek and I agree this valuation is flawed.  \n2.100  The most material difference in the values that Mr Kaczmarek and I assess for the \nreal estate assets relates to Hotel Zirka. This difference arises because \nMr Kaczmarek accepts my DCF valuation of the main hotel building but considers \nthat it is necessary to add to  this amount further value in respect of a separate \nstaff building. I do not consider that this is appropriate because:  \n(1) if the staff building generates value through reduced salaries in lieu of \nemployees paying rent, this value will have already been c aptured in my \nDCF valuation and therefore no additional value needs to be added;  \n(2) the information available in the contemporaneous valuation reports \nindicates that the staff building does not generate additional income, and \nhence that the value of the staff building would have already been captured \nin my DCF; and  \n \n48  Joint statement of Mr Thomas and Mr Kaczmarek dated 14 March 2022, ¶ 6.2. \nD26/1/30\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 31 (3) the first -listed author of the only contemporaneous report that ascribed \nadditional value to the staff building  (the Veritas 2016 Zirka Report ) \nsubsequently revised their view and authored a later -dated report in which \nthey did not attribute any separate value to the staff building.  \n2.101  In Section 10 , I also explain that I consider Mr Kaczmarek’s approach to valuing \nthe staff building by applying a discount to Veritas’ valuation of the staff building \nto be  not well-founded.  \nD26/1/31\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 32 3. Mr Kaczmarek’s instructions  \nIntroduction  \n3.1 Mr Kaczmarek and I have different instructions. Mr Kaczmarek summarises his \ninstructions as follows:49 \n(1) “I have been instructed […] to assess whether the values of the Trans ferred \nAssets as reported by PrivatBank in its 2016 financial statements were in \naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), the \naccounting standards under which PrivatBank prepared its financial \nstatements ”;  \n(2) “If PrivatBank d id not report the Transferred Assets in accordance with IFRS \n13, I will explain to the Court why that is so and to provide  [sic] my own \nindependent Fair Value calculation that would conform to IFRS 13 ”;  \n(3) “I am instructed to consider historic valuation and will opine upon the work \ndone to support the restated "}

In contrast, I have been instructed to set out my own opinion on the \nvalue of the Transferred Assets.51  \n3.6 It is possible to conclude that a valuation is in accordance with IFRS even if one’s \nown valuation would have been different. Mr Kaczmarek agrees with this, stating \nthat “ While reasonable valuation professionals may reach different value \nconclusions for these assets [the real estate assets]  based on the a doption of \ndifferent assumptions, it is entirely possible for both valuations to be compliant \nwith IFRS 13 ”.52 Indeed, Mr Kaczmarek suggests that a very broad range of \nvaluations may be considered IFRS -compliant.53 For example:  \n(1) Mr Kaczmarek considers t hat the Original 2016 Values of the Petrol Stations \nand OSFs were reasonable.54 However, his own valuations are 33% higher in \nthe case of the Petrol Stations and 58% lower  in the case of the OSFs; and  \n(2) as an even more extreme example in relative terms, the Pidgorodnye \nAirfield had an NBU Value of UAH 34m but an Original 2016 Value more \nthan ten times this, at UAH 366m.55 Mr Kaczmarek appears to consider both \nvalues to be IFRS -compliant.56  \n \n50  I was instructed to value the assets at an appropriate date between March 2016 and \nOctober 2016 (the dates between which the assets were transferred to the Bank). Exhibit \nMB-A1: My Instructions, ¶ 5.4. I have chosen the date of 1 July 2016 for convenience.  \n51  Exhibit MB -A1: My Instructions, ¶ 5.1. \n52  BK1, ¶ 34.  \n53  I explain at ¶¶ 4.50  to 4.53  that I disagree with Mr Kaczmarek’s assessment that such a \nwide range of valuations is permitted under IFRS 13.  \n54  TA-JS, ¶ 3.3. \n55  BK1, Table 1.  \n56  BK1, ¶ 34. \nD26/1/33\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022 "}

Therefore, EY’s audit opinions appear to be \ndirectly relevan t to Mr  Kaczmarek’s work. I explain the work of EY, both as an \nauditor  and the author of the EY Report , in Section 4 .  \nValuation date  \n3.8 A further implication of Mr Kaczmarek’s instructions is that to assess whether the \nOriginal 2016 Values comply with IFRS, Mr Kaczmarek has to consider the value of \nthe Transferred Assets at the Bank’s financial year end, which is \n31 December  2016. It is not clear to me why the Bank’s choice of financial year \nshould determine the appropriate date on which to value the Transfer red Asset s \nin this dispute. While the correct date is a matter for the Court , it seems to me \nthat the value ascribed to the assets on the date on which the assets were \npurportedly used to repay indebtedness under the outstanding loans is relevant.  \n3.9 I perfo rm my valuations as at 1 July 2016, six months earlier than Mr Kaczmarek’s \nvaluation date. Mr Kaczmarek states that he does not  “believe the difference in \nour chosen dates has any effect ” although he does not set out any analysis to \nsupport this.57 We agre e that the difference in our respective valuation dates is \nnot a driver of the differences in our valuations of real estate assets.58 However, I \nconsider that our differen t valuation dates drives part of the difference in our \nvaluations of the Petrol Stati ons and OSFs due to changes in the UAH/USD \nexchange rate  between our valuation dates . I explain this when discussing these \nspecific assets later in this report.  \n3.10 Mr Kaczmarek is also instructed to opine, to the extent possible, on whether the \nasset values reported in the Bank’s 2017 and 2018 audited financial statements \nconform to IFRS 13. Mr  Kaczmarek does not, however, provide analysis at these \ndates. I am only instructed to consider the value of the assets in 2016.59   \n \n57  BK1, ¶ 18. \n58  TA-JS, ¶ 9.3. \n59  Exhibit MB -A1: My Instructions , ¶ 5.4. \nD26/1/34\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 35 Standard of value  \n3.11 I am instructed to assess the market value  of the Transferred Assets while \nMr Kaczmarek assess es compliance with IFRS, meaning that he considers the fair \nvalue  of these assets.60 Setting aside our respective instructions, he appears to \nconsider that fair v alue rather than market value is the relevant standard to \nconsider for the purposes of this dispute.61 I consider this to be a matter of law, \nbut we agree that the choice of standard of value does not have a material effect \non the assets we have both been instructed to value.62 Nonetheless, for \ncompleteness , I respond to Mr  Kaczmarek’s views on the interpretation  of fair \nvalue in Appendix  3. I explain that, based on my experience as an accountant and \nvaluer, I consider that Mr Kaczmarek has misinterpreted t he valuation hierarchy \nunder IFRS . As a result, he states that there are differences between market value \nand fair value, when there are no such material differences  in practice.  \n3.12 I also consider that Mr Kaczmarek has inconsistently applied his own \ninterpre tation of IFRS.

When valuing certain real estate assets, Mr Kaczmarek \nexpresses a preference for the cost approach . For instance, when valuing a \nstadium, airfield and training centre, Mr Kaczmarek disagrees with Mr Thomas’ \nuse of the income  (i.e., DCF) approach  to value these assets and, in all three \ninstances , he relies on the cost approach . He states in respect of the stadium and \ntraining centre that:63 \n“Mr Thomas has dismissed the use of the cost approach in favor of the \nincome approach, despite the fact that historical cost information was \navailable, while historical revenue and cost information was not. In the \ncase of these assets, the cost approach is  the methodology that makes \nmost use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable \ninputs. Therefore, I do not believe that Mr. Thomas’ valuation [using the \nincome approach]  of these two assets conforms to IFRS 13.”  \n3.13 Elsewhere, he explains that:64 \n“…Fair Value determinations, as I explained above, require the use of the \nvaluation technique which uses the fewest number of unobservable \ninputs. EY recognized no income or operating cost data was available. I \ndo not know why that was so.  However, in the absence of such data, the \nCost Approach would be the preferred valuation technique since the cost \ndata is observable.”  \n \n60  Exhibit MB -A1: My Instructions , ¶ 5.4. \n61  TA-JS, ¶ 4.2.  \n62  TA-JS, ¶ 2.10 . Mr Kaczmarek does appear, however, to consider that the standard of value \naffects the valuation of other assets that he and Mr Thomas value (BK1 , ¶ 84).  \n63  BK1, ¶ 30. \n64  BK1, ¶ 121. \nD26/1/35\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 36 3.14 As explained in Appendix 3 , I disagree with Mr Kaczmarek’s reasons for preferring \nthe cost approach . However, I note tha t there is also no historical revenue or \noperating cost information available for the OSFs. In these circumstances, \nMr Kaczmarek’s approach, as set out above, appears to suggest that he would \nprefer to rely on cost information and the cost approach  to valu e these assets. \nHowever:  \n(1) he concludes that the Original 2016 Values for the OSFs were compliant \nwith IFRS, although none of the valuations used for the purposes of \nestablishing the Original 2016 Values used the cost approach ; and  \n(2) when discussing hi s own valuation of the OSFs he does not discuss the \napplication of the cost approach  and instead adopts an income approach .  \nInconsistencies between Mr Kaczmarek’s report s and instructions  \n3.15 The content of Mr Kaczmarek’s report s does not align with his instr uctions. In \nparticular, he appears to have interpreted his instruction to assess the \nreasonableness of the Original 2016 Valuations as an instruction to assess the \nreasonableness of values he calls “NBU -verified values” , which I refer to in this \nreport as the “NBU Values”. The implication of this is that : \n(1) when considering the real estate assets Mr Kaczmarek focuses his review \non the NBU Values rather than the Original 2016 Values, adopting the NBU \nValues as his conclusions in most cases; and  \n(2) Mr Kac zmarek performs his own valuations of the Petrol Stations and OSFs \ndespite concluding that the Original 2016 Values comply with IFRS, on the \nbasis that NBU Values are not available for all these assets.  \n3.16 I comment below in further detail on Mr Kaczmarek’s opinions and valuations.  \nD26/1/36\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | "}

In some cases I have not seen the underlying \nanalysis supporting these values, and in other cases where I have seen underlying \nreports they are flawed.  \nMr Kaczmarek’s analysis in respect of Petrol Stations and OSFs  \n3.19 Mr Kaczmarek concludes that the Original 2016 Values for both the Petrol Stations \nand OSFs were IFRS -compliant.68 As noted above, w hen he reached such a \nconclusion in respect of the NBU Values of real estate assets he stated that it was \nnot necessary to perform his own valuation. However, he considers it is necessary \nto present his own valuation of the Petrol Stations and OSFs.  \n3.20 He explains that he “ has performed his own fair value calculations of the petrol \nstations and OSFs because the NBU validated a subset of petrol stations and OSFs, \nsome of which were Transferred Assets while others were not ”.69 It is unclear why \nthis is relevant because he has not been instructed to consider the \nreasonableness of the NBU Values but rather the reasonableness of the Original \n2016 Values, which are available for all the Petrol Stations and OSFs.  \n \n65  BK1, ¶ 34. \n66  TA-JS, ¶ 3.10.  \n67  BK1, ¶ 158.  \n68  TA-JS, ¶ 3.3. \n69  TA-JS, ¶ 3.10.  \nD26/1/37\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 38 3.21 In a further inconsistency, after performing his own valuation of the OSFs, \nMr Kaczmarek cross -checks his conclusions against the valuation reductions \nrelative to the Original 2016 Values implied by the NBU Values to suggest that his \nconcluded values are re asonable.70 Mr Kaczmarek makes no such comparison in \nrespect of the Petrol Stations, where his concluded values are 31% higher  than \nthe Original 2016 Values versus the NBU Values which are 4% lower .71  \n3.22 Notwithstanding that the NBU Values do not appear to c over all the Petrol \nStations, Mr Kaczmarek does not address why his valuation of the Petrol Stations \nis inconsistent with the NBU ’s views .

EY’s work as auditor and author of the EY Report  \nIntroduction  \n4.1 EY assessed the value of the Bank’s assets in two capacities: (i ) as auditor of the \nBank’s financial statements for the 2016 financial year and onwards; and (ii) as \nauthor of the EY Report, which was a separate non -audit engagement in 2016  \n(prior to its appointment as auditor)  in which EY reviewed valuations of certain  \nassets. I discuss EY’s work in this section.  \n4.2 In relation to EY’s role as auditor I explain that:  \n(1) the purpose of an audit is to express an opinion on whether the financial \nstatements are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with \nthe applicable financial reporting framework. This gives users  of the \nfinancial statements confidence. An auditor’s work  includes interrogating \nvaluations of assets recorded on the balance sheet, including any \nassumptions on which these valuations are base d. Mr Kaczmarek \nunderemphasises the role of an auditor in interrogating valuations;  \n(2) EY’s audit opinions between 2016 and 2018 suggest that the Restated 2016 \nValues are a more reliable indicator of the value of the Transferred Assets \nthan the Original 2016 Values.72 Mr Kaczmarek suggests that EY’s audit \nopinions do not indicate the relative reliability of the Original and Restated \n2016 Values . I disagree; and  \n(3) Mr Kaczmarek expresses concerns about the consistency of the value of the \nTransferred Asse ts and amounts recorded in the financial statement s \nreviewed by EY . I consider that these concerns are unfounded.   \n4.3 In relation to EY’s role as the author of the EY Report:  \n(1)  the EY Report "}

EY did not qualify its opinion in respect of the Transferred Assets in \n2018 ( MB1 -TA, footnote  66). \nD26/1/40\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 41 (2) the EY Report is a relevant contemporaneous source of information for \nassessing whether the Original 2016 Values are compliant with IFRS. \nMr Kaczmarek does not consider that the EY Report is relevant for this \npurpose because assessing IFRS compliance was not within the scope of the \nEY Report. I disagree  that this means the EY Report is not relevant for \nassessing whether the Original 2016 Values  were IFRS compliant .  \nThe purpose and role of an auditor  \n4.4 I set out below my views on the purpose and role of an auditor, including in the \ncontext of reviewing valuations. I refer to documents to support my views but I \nalso rely on the following experience:  \n(1) from 1988 to 2006, I worked (including as a Partner) in the specialist \nvaluation practices of two of the leading international accounting firms \n(Deloitte and Arthur Andersen). My work there involved, in part, assisting \naudit colle agues in addressing valuation questions, reviewing valuations \nprepared by specialist valuers for use in the financial statements of \ncompanies audited by my firm, and preparing valuations for use by \ncompanies in their financial statements (and which would i n turn be \nscrutinised by their auditors);  and \n(2) around the time of the Asset Transfer , I was a non -executive director and \nsat on the audit committee of a Belgian company which prepared IFRS \nfinancial statements audited under the International Standards o n Audit \n(the “ ISAs ”), being the financial reporting and audit standards which also \napplied to the Bank’s financial statements .73 \n \n73  This company was Stelara N.V., a Belgian holding company for the Truvo group of \ncompanies, which operated leading directories, search and advertising businesses, and \nhad annual revenues of c. EUR 90m.  \nD26/1/41\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 42 4.5 The preparation of financial statements is the responsibility of the company’s \nmanagement. However, management may commission s pecialists to provide \ninput on certain areas. For example, valuation specialists may provide input on \nthe value of assets (as appears to have been the case with the Transferred \nAssets). It is then the auditor’s role to express an opinion on the conformity of the \nfinancial statements with IFRS,74 including, in particular, whether the financial \nstatements are materially misstated.75 \n4.6 Mr Kaczmarek comments on the scope of EY’s role as an auditor but does not \nprovide any support for his comments. For instance, h e does not refer to the \nstandards or guidance that govern the work of auditors and he does not refer to \nany personal experience of audit processes.  \n4.7 Mr Kaczmarek and I appear to agree that the auditor’s role is to check compliance \nwith accounting standards .76 However, we disagree on the auditor’s role in \nassessing and int"}

For \nexample, it is not an auditor’s role to question certain inputs into a \ndiscount rate calculation (such as which beta input or market risk \npremium input should be utilized in the capital asset pricing model) […] \nIn other words, the auditor does not make modifications to the valuation \ntechnique to fit their own preference.  \nThat said, if an auditor believes that certain parameters of a calculation \nare rather dubious, this would be brought to  management’s attention.”  \n4.8 I do not agree and consider that the responsibilities of an auditor in interrogating \nvaluations are more extensive, as I explain below.  \n \n74  For example, see Exh ibit MB -A117: PrivatBank consolidated financial statements 2016, pdf \npage 4.  \n75  IFRS defines a material misstatement as something that could “ individually or collectively, \ninfluence the economic decisions that users make on the basis of the financial state ments ” \n(Exhibit MB -B122: IAS 1, Page A 767). That is, when reviewing the financial statements, the \nauditor’s objective is not to ensure that the financial statements present values that are, \nfor example,  conservative, but rather that are materially correct (i.e. neither too high nor \ntoo low).  \n76  BK1, ¶ 92. \n77  BK1, ¶¶ 97 and 98.  \nD26/1/42\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 43 The relevant audit standards  \n4.9 EY audited the Bank’s 2016 financial statements in accordance wit h the ISAs.78 \nThese are the same audit standards which are applied in the UK and other \ncountries.  \n4.10 The ISAs explain the nature and the scope of the audit which EY was required to \nperform. ISA 200 states:79 \n“The purpose of an audit is to enhance the degree of confidence of \nintended users in the financial statements. This is achieved by the \nexpression of an opinion by the auditor on whether the financial \nstatements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with an \napplicable financial reporting fr amework. In the case of most general \npurpose frameworks, that opinion is on whether the financial statements \nare presented fairly, in all material respects, or give a true and fair view80 \nin accordance with the framework.”  \nand \n“As the basis for the auditor’s opinion, ISAs require the auditor to obtain \nreasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole \nare free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. \nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance. It is obtain ed when \nthe auditor has obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence to reduce \naudit risk (that is, the risk that the auditor expresses an inappropriate \nopinion when the financial statements are materially misstated) to an \nacceptably low level. However, reasonable assurance is not an absolute \nlevel of assurance, because there are inherent limitations of an audit \nwhich result in most of the audit evidence on which the auditor draws \nconclusions and bases the auditor’s opinion being persuasive rather than \nconclusive.”  \n4.11 The ISAs require that auditors “ exercise professional judgment […] throughout the \nplanning and performance of the audit ”.

The ISA \nexplains that valuations in the financial statements are subject to a higher risk of \nbeing materially misstated than other entries in the financial statements due to \nthe estimates they reflect. It provides guidance on how to audit such estimates.82 \nFor example, when discussing how an auditor may describe the work they have \nperformed when assessing a discount rate, the ISA gives the following example: \n“the auditor focused on judgments made by management in the develop ment and \nselection of an appropriate discount rate, in particular the selection of an \nappropriate beta for calculation of the cost of equity ”.83 The performance of such \nwork is contrary to Mr Kaczmarek’s view  that it is not the auditor’s role to \nquestion subjective valuation inputs, for which he provides the example of the \nassumed level of an input to a cost of capital estimate (specifically, the “beta” \nassumption ).84 \n4.13 The ISA does not distinguish between objec tive and subjective inputs (or \n‘observable’ and ‘unobservable’ inputs) in the way that Mr Kaczmarek does, but \nrecognises that “ the extent of subjectivity, such as whether an assumption or input \nis observable, influences the degree of estimation uncertainty  and thereby the \nauditor’s assessment of the risk of material misstatement for a particular \naccounting estimate ”.85 That is, although Mr Kaczmarek appears to consider that \n“it is not an auditor’s role to question certain inputs into a discount rate \ncalcula tion” ,86 I consider that, other things equal, the more subjective an input \n(such as an input into a discount rate), the more an auditor will examine it.  \n4.14 In my direct experience,87 including around the time during which EY performed \nits work, auditors do no t limit their review of valuations to a check of arithmetic \naccuracy.  \n \n82  Exhibit MB -B125: ISA 540, ¶ 2. \n83  Exhibit MB -B126: IAASB, ISA 540 (revised) implementation – Simple and Complex \nillustrative example, May 2020 , page 41.

In \ndoing so, they would likely per form their own independent discount rate \nassessment and compare it to management’s discount rate. If the auditor f inds \nthat its own assessment differed from management’s, it may seek to obtain \nfurther evidence, whether from: (i) further testing (such as re viewing other \nsources for the discount rate inputs, or the other (non -discount rate) inputs to the \nvaluation); or (ii)  enquiries with management (to understand the source of its \nviews).  \n4.16 If, after further review, the auditor does not consider the valuation  is presented in \naccordance with IFRS, and the difference in management’s valuation and the \nauditor’s own assessment leads to a material misstatement,88 the auditor may \nrequire the valuation to be revised (or else issue a qualified audit opinion).  \nRange of  reasonable opinions in a valuation  \n4.17 Mr Kaczmarek’s comments focus on unobservable inputs to the valuation process. \nI explain below that where an input is uncertain, that does not mean that any \ninput presented by the company subject to the audit should simply be accepted \nby the auditor.  \n4.18 By their nature, where a particular input to a valuation is subject to increased \nsubjectivity, there may be a range of values that are considered reasonable. \nISA 540 specifically considers situations where “[t] here are alte rnative sources of \nrelevant data available to the auditor which can be used in developing a point \nestimate or a range ”.89 In this situation, the auditor should:90  \n“Develop a point estimate or a range to evaluate management’s point \nestimate. For this purpo se: (Ref: Para. A87 –A91)  \n \n88  As stated at ¶ 4.10  the auditor has to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial \nstatements are free from material misstatement. I do not know the level of materiality \nthat EY applied in its audit (which is  typically expressed as a percentage of profit, revenue \nor net assets). However, given the significant differences between Mr Kaczmarek’s \nassessments and the Original and Restated 2016 Values, I consider that, at least in respect \nof the Petrol Stations and  OSFs, it is unlikely that Mr Kaczmarek’s valuations would be \nconsidered ‘immaterially’ different to those in the financial statements. In its original 2016 \nfinancial statements, the Bank recorded net assets of negative UAH 714m ( Exhibit MB -\nA117: PrivatBan k consolidated financial statements 2016) compared to a difference \nbetween the Original 2016 Values and Mr Kaczmarek’s assessments of the Petrol Stations \nof UAH 2,103m and OSFs of UAH 3,315 m (see Table 2 -1). These differences are therefore \nlarger in magnit ude than the Bank’s net asset deficit.  \n89  Exhibit MB -B125: ISA 540, ¶ A87.  \n90  Exhibit MB -B125: ISA 540, ¶ 13.  \nD26/1/45\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 46 (i) If the auditor uses assumptions or methods that differ from \nmanagement’s, the auditor shall obtain an understanding of \nmanagement’s assumptions or methods sufficient to establish \nthat the auditor’s point estimate or range takes int o account \nrelevant variables and to evaluate any significant differences \nfrom management’s point estimate.

The calculation \nof fair values requires judgme nt which  means  that it is  subject to risk of \nmaterial misstatement  and so required particular attention from EY. The \nOriginal 2016 Values for the Transferred Assets equated to 7% of the Bank’s \ntotal assets on its 2016 balance sheet , and significantly excee ded its net \nasset  balance , so should have been a key area of interest for EY;92 \n \n91  Exhibit MB -B125: ISA 540, ¶ A93.  \n92  UAH 14, 627m / UAH 205,359m = 7%.

The largest asset balance \nthat was restated between the 2016 and 2018 financial statements was \n‘repossessed collateral’ (which was reduced from UAH 21.8bn to \nUAH  8.8bn) and hence I would have expected EY to perform significant \namount s of work when auditing the Restated 2016 Values;93  \n(3)  the valuation reports which valued the Transferred Assets in 2016, other \nthan those used for the Original 2016 Values, should be considered \n“alternative sources of relevant data ” and therefore could  be used by EY to \nhelp develop its own point estimate of value to compare to the Original \n2016 Values;  \n(4)  Mr Kaczmarek is incorrect to say that “ it is not an auditor’s role to question \ncertain inputs into a discount rate calculation (such as which beta i nput or \nmarket risk premium input should be utilized in the capital asset pricing \nmodel)” because, as explained above, this is contrary to the applicable audit \nstandards; and  \n(5)  Mr Kaczmarek overstates the range of assumptions which are permitted \nunder I FRS.

Rather, the auditor \nreviews the model and evaluates whether the assumptions used are \nreasonable  and the model is appropriate considering the entity's \ncircumstances. For example, it may be inappropriate to use discounted \ncash flows for valuing an equity investment in a start -up enterprise if \nthere are no current revenues on which to base the forecast of future \nearnings or cash flows.  \n[¶39] The auditor should test the data used to develop the fair value \nmeasurements and disclosu res and evaluate whether the fair value \nmeasurements have been properly determined from such data and \nmanagement's assumptions .

Therefore, if these reports caused EY to have concerns regarding the \nvolume assumptions  underlying t he 2016 valuations , I would consider that \nappropriate.

EY did not qualif y its audit opinion in respect of the restated \nvalue of the Bank’s repossessed collateral as at 31 December 2016. This indicates \nthat EY considered that these restated figures were presented in accordance with \nIFRS. As part of this restatement, the Original 2016 Values (included in the 2016 \nand 2017 financial statements) were adjusted downwards to the Restated 2016 \nValues (included in t he 2018 financial statements).  \n4.33 EY does not explain why it issued an unqualified opinion on the Restated 2016 \nValues but not the Original 2016 Values  (and I would not expect it to do so). I \ninfer, however, from the explanations that EY provided for qualifying its earlier \nopinions that it had sufficient appropriate audit evidence to agree the amounts in \nthe 2018 financial statements, but not the 2016 and 2017 financial statements.  \n4.34 Mr Kaczmare k suggests that EY issued an unqualified opinion in 2018 in relation to \nthe 2016 value of the repossessed collateral, but not in 2016 or 2017, because the \npetrol station volumes used in the valuations to support the Original 2016 Values \ndiffered to the vol umes used in the valuations to support the 2017 values, 2018 \nvalues, and Restated 2016 Values .109 He posits therefore that in the 2017 financial \nstatements (which present the Original 2016 Values and the 2017 values), the \nPetrol Station values were calculat ed using inconsistent volumes in each year so \ncould not have received an unqualified audit opinion. In contrast, in the 2018 \nfinancial statements (which present the Restated 2016 Values, restated 2017 \nvalues and 2018 values), the Petrol Station values were  calculated using \nconsistent volumes.  \n4.35 EY did not state that this was the reason for its qualified opinion (and did not state \nthat the reason for this opinion related in whole or in part  to the  valuation of the  \nPetrol Station s).

As explained above , I have seen no evidence to support \nMr Kaczmarek ’s view that EY did not have enough time to gather sufficient \nappropriate evidence  for its 2016 audit .  \nConclusion on EY’s  audit opinions  \n4.36 Overall, I consider that, taken at face value, EY’s unqualified opinion in respect of \nthe Restated 2016 Values of the Transferred Assets contained in the Bank’s 2018 \nfinancial statements indicates that these values are more reliable than th e \nmaterially higher values contained in the 2016 and 2017 financial statements in \nrespect of which EY issued a qualified opinion.  \nThe amounts at which the Transferred Assets were recorded in the financial \nstatements  \n4.37 In Mr Kaczmarek’s First Report he points  out a number of, what he terms, \n“discrepancies ” between the amounts on the Bank’s balance sheet in relation to \nthe Transferred Assets in 2016 and 2018.110  \n4.38 Mr Kaczmarek’s concerns relating to the 2016 balance sheet amounts stemmed \nfrom a difference between the total Original 2016 Values for the Transferred \nAssets, and the ‘repossessed collateral’ line on the Bank’s 2016 balance sheet. \nMr Kaczmarek appeared to consider that these values should be the same. \nHowever, I understand that the ‘re possessed collateral’ line on the Bank’s balance \nsheet includes assets other than the Transferred Assets that were repossessed by \nthe Bank. Mr  Kaczmarek accepted this explanation in the TA Joint Statement.111  \n4.39 Mr Kaczmarek’s concerns over the balance sheet amounts for the Transferred \nAssets in the 2017 and 2018 financial statements seem to remain. He states in the \nTA Joint Statement that “[t] he Bank’s 2018 balance sheet indicates that [the] fair \nvalue of all Transferred Assets (petrol stations, OSFs, Dnipro Stadium, Airfield and \nTraining Center) has declined below the [sic] Mr Bezant’s 2016 valuation of the \nreal estate assets alone.

The value of \npremises, leasehold improvements, equipment and intangibles remained broadly \nconstant, the value of repossessed collateral decreased by UAH 1,713m, and the \nvalue of investment properties increased by UAH 2,957m.115 The financial \nstatements indicate that these changes were driven by a combination of:116 \n(i) changes to the values of the existing assets on the Bank’s balance sheet; \n(ii) reclassification of assets from repossessed collateral to investment properties; \nand (iii) additional assets being repossessed by the Bank.  \n4.44 In 2018, the total value of the assets on the Bank’s balance sheet decreased from \nUAH 14,903m to UAH 8,544m. The value of investment properties and of \npremises, leasehold improvements, equipment and intangibles remaine d roughly \nthe same between 2017 and 2018 , and t he value of repossessed collateral \ndecreased by UAH 5,708m.117 Again, it is clear from the financial statements that a \ncombination of factors contributed to the change in asset values.  \n4.45 The Bank’s 2018 audited financial statements  state that  “[d]uring 2018, as a result \nof additional information obtained, the Group re instated loans and advances to \ncustomers and respectively corrected (reduced) the carrying value of the \nrepossessed collateral in the amount of UAH 5,613 million ”.118 I have no additional \ninformation on this, but it appears that the value of repossessed col lateral was \nreduced by UAH 5,613m in 2018 because the Bank received additional \ninformation indicating that certain assets previously received in repayment of \nloans should not be retained as repayment  of loans , and therefore returned those \nassets to the customer and reinstated the loan.

In general, EY \nconsidered that the fair value of the Transferred Assets was substantially lower \nthan their Original 2016 Values.120  \n4.47 My opinion on the relevance of the EY Report in as sessing the value of the \nTransferred Assets has not changed since my First Report.  \n4.48 Mr Kaczmarek  appears not to place much weight on the EY Report because he is \ninstructed to assess the conformity of the Original 2016 Values to IFRS , whereas \nEY was instruct ed to perform its own assessment of the fair value of the assets . \nHe states:121 \n“I would like to emphasize that, while EY is in some instances critical of \nthe Fair Value calculations prepared by the valuers employed by \nPrivatBank in 2016, their criticisms o ften reflect the views of one \nvaluation professional versus another. Indeed, I have my own criticisms \nof EY’s views. Thus, criticisms do not render the valuations performed by \nthe valuation professionals non -compliant with IFRS 13. That is the lens \nthrough  which EY ought to have prepared the desk review in my view.”  \n4.49 Mr Kaczmarek states that EY’s views differed to the valuations used for the 2016 \nfinancial statements due to differences in matters of judgment, and that the \nchanges made by EY to the valuations  it reviewed were subjective:122 \n“[S]ome of the differences identified by EY would, in my opinion, fall into \nthe category of professional disagreement. For example, EY disagreed \nwith certain comparable properties utilized to value “33 land plots in the \nOdes a region.” Whether or not a property is sufficiently comparable is \noften subjective and a matter on which valuation professionals may \nreasonably disagree.”  \n4.50 Mr Kaczmarek considers that IFRS 13 allows for a wide scope of judgment to be \napplied in valuations,  and hence that EY’s criticisms do not mean that the \nvaluations performed by the third -party valuers are not compliant with IFRS 13.123  \n \n119  MB1 -TA, ¶ 3.8. \n120  MB1 -TA, ¶¶ 3.9 to 3.10.  \n121  BK1, ¶ 124.  \n122  BK1, ¶ 118.  \n123  BK1, ¶ 124.  \nD26/1/56\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 57 4.51 I disagree with Mr Kaczmarek’s assessment.

For instance : \n(1) USD 1 equated to UAH 7.99 until the end of 2013 when the Ukrainian \ngovernment removed the fixed relationship between the USD and the UAH; \nbut \n(2) on Mr Kaczmarek’s val uation date of 31 December 2016, USD 1 was \nequivalent to UAH 27.19 , 3.4 times the number of UAH  before the \nexchange rate peg was removed .  \nD26/1/59\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 60 Figure 5-1: UAH -USD exchange rate, 201 2 to 2016  \n \nSource: Appendix 5 , tab ‘Transactions’ . \n5.5 Because he performs his calculations in USD before converting to UAH, \nMr Kaczmarek’s conclusions will vary  depending on whether:  \n(1)  the USD result of his DCF valuations of the Petrol Stations and OSFs are \nconverted at his valuation date or at mine;  \n(2) the prices paid in transactions involving comparable petrol stations on \nwhich Mr Kaczmarek relies are converted at Mr Kaczmarek’s valuation date, \nmy valuation date or the earlier transaction date; and  \n(3) the valuations of Cr imean petrol stations and oil storage facilities arrived at \nin the Crimean Arbitrations to which Mr Kaczmarek refers are converted at \nMr Kaczmarek’s valuation date, my valuation date or the date of valuation \nin the Crimean Arbitrations . \n5.6 The effect of this decision is particularly significant in respect of (2) and (3) above \n(i.e. Mr Kaczmarek’s reliance on market transactions and on work he performed in  \nthe Crimean A rbitrations ) because those transactions took place, or those \nvaluations were conducted, at much earlier dates since which  there have been \nsignificant exchange rate changes . \n05101520253035\nDec-11 Dec-12 Dec-13 Dec-14 Dec-15 Dec-16My valuation dateMr Kaczmarek's valuation date Valuation date of the \nCrimean arbitrations\nDate of transactions \nrelied on by \nMr Kaczmarek\nD26/1/60\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 61 5.7 When considering the correct approach, it is necessary to consider the \nimplications for the val ue of a Ukrainian petrol station or oil storage facility of a \nchange in exchange rates.

These two \namounts can be very different given changes in the exchange rate, differing by a \nfactor of more than three between 31 December 2013 and 31 December 20 16.   \n5.8 Mr Kaczmarek and I appear to disagree on the answer to this question. As I \nexplain below, I consider that the value of a Ukrainian petrol station and oil \nstorage facility will tend to remain constant in UAH terms when exchange rates \nchange, whereas M r Kaczmarek considers that their values will tend to remain \nconstant in USD terms.  \n5.9 When discussing the appropriate currency in which to perform his analysis, \nMr Kaczmarek refers to the fact that oil trades in USD, refiners purchase oil in \nUSD, refineries set prices of their oil product derivatives in USD and petrol stations \nare retail traders of oil product derivatives .131 I do not consider that this justifies \nhis view that the value of a petrol station or oil storage facility in Ukraine is more \nlikely to h old steady in USD than UAH. I explain below that:  \n(1) Mr Kaczmarek’s view would require that, following a weakening of the UAH \nagainst the USD, Ukrainian citizens would be willing to buy the same \namount of petrol at exactly the same price in USD as they di d before the \nchange in exchange rates, despite this amount now being significantly \ngreater in UAH terms and hence accounting for a much larger portion of \ntheir expenditure;  \n(2) the currency in which the Petrol Stations and OSFs earned their revenue \nand pai d their costs was UAH, not USD;  \n(3) the prices paid in transactions involving petrol stations and oil storage \nfacilities in and around Ukraine are typically expressed in local currency and \nnot USD; and  \n(4) almost all the available contemporaneous valuation s of the Petrol Stations \nand OSFs were performed in UAH.  \n5.10 I then explain the implications of this for a valuation of the Petrol Stations and \nOSFs.  \n \n131  BK2,  ¶ 39. \nD26/1/61\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 62 Effect on a petrol station’s operations of a material change in exchange rates  \n5.11 I consider below the implicati ons of the value of a petrol station remaining \nconstant in USD terms following a material weakening of the UAH against the USD \nby a factor of three, such as that which occurred in the years leading up to my \nvaluation date. Similar reasoning can be applied to the value of an OSF.  \n5.12 For this petrol station’s value to remain constant in USD terms, its expected future \ncash flows in USD must also remain the same as they were before the exchange \nrate movement. That w ould , however, require a substantial increase in  those cash \nflows when expressed in UAH, and hence mean that Ukrainian citizens w ould  \nneed to be willing (and able) to spend a greater portion of their income on petrol \nthan they did before the exchange rate movement.  \n5.13 The value of the petrol station w ould  only remain constant in USD terms if both:  \n(1) the petrol station can increase its prices significantly in UAH so that they \nremain the same  in USD; and  \n(2)  having increased prices in this way, there is no decline in fuel sales volumes \neither as a result of customers buy ing fuel from lower priced competitors or \nbecause the customers reduce their consumption in response to the price \nincrease.   \n5.14 I would not expect this to be the case  in circumstances such as these where the \nexchange rate has changed by a fac tor of three .

Instead, I would expect that if a \npetrol station sought to raise its prices significantly (i.e. by three times) in UAH \nterms to remain constant in USD terms, then:  \n(1) other operators would start to sell fuel in the local area at a lower price. If \nany operator could maintain its USD profits its UAH profitability would be \nthree times what it was previously. Such an increase in profitability would \nmake the market more attractive to new entrants , willing to accept a \nsmaller mark -up; and  \n(2) any increase in fuel prices would have a negative effect on sales volumes. \nFuel prices would be likely to rise even if operators maintained their UAH \nmark -up (rather than increasing it) due to an increase in the price of raw \nmaterials  priced in USD . This wo uld reduce sales volumes and hence have a \nnegative effect on petrol station profits.   \n5.15 Given the latter effect above, a weakening of the UAH against the USD might \nresult in the value of a petrol station falling  in UAH terms, rather than increasing  \nas Mr Ka czmarek assumes.  \nD26/1/62\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 63 5.16 Mr Kaczmarek takes a different view. He suggests that I consider petrol stations \nwould “uniquely be prevented ” from raising their prices like all other market \nparticipants in the Ukrainian market.132 This is incorrect. Mr Kaczmarek’s \nsugge stion implies that if exchange rates change by a factor of three, prices of all \nproducts in Ukraine will simply rise by a factor of three so that they remain \nconstant in USD terms. As shown in Figure 5-2 below, this has not been the case . \nInstead , the price s of Ukrainian goods after accounting for inflation have  fallen  in \nUSD terms  since the Ukrainian government removed the fixed relationship \nbetween the USD and the UAH  at the end of 2013 . \nFigure 5-2: Indexed change in the price of Ukrainian goods in USD ( 31 December \n2011 = 1) \n \nSource: Appendix 5, tab ‘ Figures for report ’.  \n5.17 I have not presented the analysis above in respect of  petrol prices in Ukraine \nspecifically because the value of a petrol station is not driven solely by the price of \nfuel. I agree with Mr Kaczmarek that the price of petrol in Ukraine will in part \nchange to reflect exchange rat e changes, since thes e affect the cost of crude oil, \nused to produce petrol. However, the value of a petrol station depends primarily \non the mark -up that it is able to achieve above its fuel and other costs, rather \nthan the total price charged. As for Ukrainian retailers gener ally, I would not \nexpect a Ukrainian retailer of petrol to seek to increase its UAH mark -up following \na weakening of the UAH.  \n \n132  TA-JS, ¶ 7.9. \n0.00.51.01.5\nDec-11 Dec-12 Dec-13 Dec-14 Dec-15 Dec-16\nD26/1/63\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 64 5.18 Mr Kaczmarek comments in the TA Joint Statement:133 \n“Mr Bezant’s commentary about the inability of Ukrainian customers to \npay high er prices for fuel because of a depreciation of the UAH vis -à-vis \nthe USD is not supported by any elasticity of demand analysis.”  \n5.19 Such an analysis would explore the change in fuel volumes sold, given a change in \nthe price of fuel of a given amount.

Similarly, Mr Kaczmarek notes that neither of us assumes that \nfuture changes in exchange rates will impact future profit margins in our DCF \ncalculations.  \n5.20 Given my valuation approach, I do not consider it necessary to perform such \nanalys es, because:  \n(1)  my DCF valuation assumes relatively modest increases in the profits of each \npetrol station over time. In the long term I assume increases in line with \nUkrainian inflation, which are unlikely to have a ma terial effect on local \ncompetition or on fuel volumes sold; and  \n(2) while Ukrainian exchange rates had changed materially in the years leading  \nup to our respective valuation dates, the best estimates of future exchange \nrates at our valuation dates were sim ilar to the current exchange rate at the \ntime.134   \n5.21 Mr Kaczmarek’s analysis based on comparable transactions assumes a much \nlarger increase in petrol station profits in UAH because of the more significant \nchanges in historical exchange rates. It is therefore important to consider the \nimplications of such ex change rate movements when relying on transactions from \na time when exchange rates were materially different. Mr Kaczmarek  relies on \ntransactions in effect by  assum ing petrol stations in Ukraine  are able to increase \ntheir UAH mark -up to more than three tim es their level at the time of the earlier \ntransaction, but does not provide compelling support for this assumption.  \nCurrency in which the Petrol Stations and OSFs earned revenues and paid costs  \n5.22 While Mr Kaczmarek refers to the USD pricing of interna tiona l commodities, he \nagrees that the revenues and costs of the Petrol Stations and OSFs appear to have \nbeen incurred in UAH.135 For example:  \n(1) we agree that the Petrol Stations priced their fuel in UAH;136 and \n \n133  TA-JS, ¶ 7.9. \n134  TA-JS, ¶ 7.9. \n135  BK2, ¶ 155.  \n136  MB1 -TA, Appendix 8; and BK2,  Appendix D, tab ‘ D.2_Inputs ’. \nD26/1/64\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 65 (2) a document produced by the Ukrainian Ministry of Energy and Coal in \nJanuary 2016  indicates that around 60% of the retail fuel price is incurred in \nUAH, including taxes, logistics and trade margin s.137  \n5.23 Given this, I consider it more appropriate to perform any DCF valuation in UAH. \nThis is consistent with Professor Damodaran’s view that the appropriate currency \nin which to perform a valuation is that for which it is easiest to acquire financial \ninformation which, in this case, is UAH.138 In his DCF analysis, Mr Kaczmarek has \ngathered revenue and cost information in UAH, converts these amounts from \nUAH to USD, performs his valuation, then converts his result back to UAH.

I do \nnot consider that it is appropriate for Mr Kaczmarek to compare transaction \nprices and valuations from earlier dates  in USD terms  to his valuation in USD as at \n31 December 2016, given th e material change in exchange rates between the two \ndates, which mean that one USD would have been much more valuable in UAH \nterms as at 2016 than earlier dates.  \n5.28 I note that if Mr Kaczmarek is correct that the value of a petrol station or OSF \nholds steady  in USD terms rather than UAH terms (as is implied by his reliance on \ntransaction prices he expresses in USD terms at dates when the USD/UAH \nexchange rate was materially different to his valuation date), then, holding all \nother factors equal, the value of the Petrol Stations and OSFs in UAH will have \nvaried over time as exchange rates vary. In particular, it will have changed \nbetween my valuation date and his own valuation date as a result of exchange \nrate movements. If his USD valuation were converted to U AH as at 1 July 2016 \nrather than 31  December 2016, the result would be 9% lower.  \n5.29 Mr Kaczmarek appears to disagree with this latter conclusion. He does not \nconsider that the choice of a 1 July or 31 December 2016 valuation date has a \nmaterial effect on his  calculation. He states that:144 \n“Mr. Kaczmarek is of the view that the choice of valuation date for the \nPetrol Stations is not material.

As set out in my Firs t \nReport, I consider that the COVID -19 pandemic may have affected the transaction prices \nof the auctions in 2020 and 2021, and hence only rely on transaction prices for the OSFs \nwhich were sold at auction in 2019 (MB1 -TA, ¶ 2.19).  \n154  BK2, ¶ 29. \nD26/1/69\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 70 5.40 The assessment of market value envisages a transaction in which:155 \n“both the willing buyer and the willing seller are reasonably informed \nabout the nature and characteristics of the asset, its actual and potential \nuses and the state of the market as of the valuation date”.  \n5.41 Later versions of the International Valuation Standards (in cluding the 2020 version \nthat Mr Kaczmarek quotes from )156, also comment that:157 \n“Most bases of value prohibit the consideration of information or market \nsentiment that would not be known or knowable with reasonable due \ndiligence on the measurement/valuatio n date by participants.”  \n5.42 I consider that this means it would be inappropriate to rely on information about \nthe characteristics of an asset or its actual or potential uses, when those \ncharacteristics changed  after the valuation date. However, I consider tha t it is \nappropriate to rely on information not available until after the valuation date if it \nis informative about the position as at the valuation date.  \n5.43 I can illustrate this by reference to two examples.  \n5.44 In the first, consider a house which burnt down o ne year after the valuation date. \nIt would be inappropriate to value the house at nil prior to it burning down.  \n5.45 In the second, suppose that no information is known about the value of the house \nat the valuation date, but it is known that it sold for UAH  1m six months later. I  \nconsider that information would be highly informative in assessing what a \npurchaser would have been willing to pay on the valuation date , taking into \naccount any events that could affect the house’s value in the inter vening  period  \n(even  if the details of the sale could not have been considered by a valuer at the \ntime). This is because this transaction price will reflect information that was likely \nknown or knowable at the time.  \n5.46 I have access to information about the Petrol Stations and O SFs from around my \nvaluation date. However, there are several indicators that certain information \navailable regarding the fuel sales volumes of the Petrol Stations and the \noperational status of the OSFs is unreliable. I discuss this in Sections 6 and 9 \nrespectively.  \n5.47 Although both the Petrol Station volumes and the operational status  of the  OSFs \nshould have been knowable by a potential buyer and seller following reasonable \ndue diligence, in the absence of reliable information  on these dating from before \nmy valuation date , I consider it reasonable to rely on informati"}

Petrol Stations – DCF \nIntroduction  \n6.1 Mr Kaczmarek and I both prepare DCF analyses to value the Petrol Stations. My \nconcluded value is based solely on my DCF analysis, whereas Mr Kacz marek \nattributes a 50% weighting to his DCF analysis and a 50% weighting to his market \napproach. I discuss his DCF in this section and his market approach in Section 7.  \n6.2 Mr Kaczmarek’s DCF approach results in a value of USD 313.7m, or UAH  8.5bn.158 \nThis is 34% higher than the Original 2016 Values and 360% higher than the \nRestated 2016 Values, as shown in  Figure 6-1 below.159 \nFigure 6-1: Comparison of total Petrol Station values (UAH billion)  \n \nSource: Appendix 5, tab ‘Figures for report’.   \n6.3 Mr Kaczmarek’s concluded values are  also significantly higher than any of those \nassessed by the 10 valuers who valued the Petrol Stations between 2016 and \n2019, as shown in Figure 6-2 below.  \n \n158  Converted using the prevailing exchange rate of 27.187 UAH/USD as at Mr Kaczmarek’s \nvaluation date of 31 December 2016.

In my opinion:  \n(1) there is evidence that the volumes underlying the Original 2016 Values \n(which Mr Kaczmarek adopts) are overstated. Mr Kaczmarek has not \ncommented on any of the evidence  that I presented in my First Report, in \neither his reports or the TA Joint Statement;  \n(2) in my valuation of the Petrol Stations, I have constrained the return on new \ninvested capital ( RONIC ), as I consider the Petrol Stations to be unable to \nmake superno rmal profits in the long term, as is implied by Mr Kaczmarek’s \nDCF valuation. Mr Kaczmarek’s rationale for disregarding such an \nadjustment is unfounded; and  \n(3) Mr Kaczmarek and I apply different CRPs in our discount rate assessments. I \nconsider Mr Kaczmar ek’s CRP to be unsupported, significantly understated \nand below  the range of Ukrainian CRPs used by other practitioners.  \n6.5 All three factors, in my opinion, cause Mr Kaczmarek’s valuation of the Petrol \nStation s to be overstated.  \n6.6 I discuss these points in m ore detail in this section.

I set out my reasons for \ndisagreeing with Mr Kaczmarek and hence why I do not consider any changes  are \nneeded to my valuation.  \nFuel sales volumes  \n6.7 As I explained in my First Report, there are alternative sets of fuel sales volume s \ndata for the Petrol Stations in 2015 and 2016, contained in the Original PS Reports \n(prepared by Baker Tilly, UCE, and Veritas) and the Restated PS Reports (prepared \nby Expert+ and Volyn Expert). The 2016 volumes in the Restated PS Reports are, \non averag e, about 60% lower than the equivalent volumes in the Original PS \nReports (which are contradictory even between themselves).161 The choice of \nvolumes has a significant effect on the valuation of the Petrol Stations.  \n6.8 As set out in my First Report, I conside r that the volumes assumed in the Original \nPS Reports are unreliable, and have used the lower volumes from the Volyn \nExpert Restated PS Report.  \n \n160  UAH 8.5bn / UAH 1.9bn – 1 = 356%.  \n161  By fuel type: A -92 is 64% lower, A -95 is 51% lower, diesel is 5 6% lower and gas 67% lower. \nSimple average = (64% + 51% + 5 6% + 67%) / 4 = 60%.

However, in the TA Joint \nStatement, Mr Kaczmarek commented that my rejection of these volumes based \non only 14 inconsistent volumes was an ‘ over -reaction ’, claiming the individual \ntotal volumes for each petrol station were broa dly consistent when summed over \nall fuel types.164 This is not the case for many individual Petrol Stations  but,165 \neven if it were true, I do not consider  it sufficient for the volumes to agree in total \nsince different fuel types have different fuel prices and associated costs , meaning \nthat the split of fuel type is also relevant . \n6.11 Shortly prior to the submission of the TA Joint Statement  and after I submitt ed my \nFirst Report , the Bank disclosed more detailed historical 2015 volume data used \nby BT for all 994 petrol stations that it valued. This shows  that the disparity I \nidentified is universa l: the historical  2015  volumes for all 243 of the 246 Petrol \nStati ons valued in the BT Original PS Report (as at  December 2015) differ to the \nvolumes reported in the UCE (May 2016) and Veritas Original (June 2016) PS \nReports.166 \n6.12 Such differences can be seen by comparing the data at both the level of individual \nPetrol Stat ions and in aggregate. For example, for the Petrol Station located in \nBugayevka village, the total volumes sold in 2015 in the BT Original PS Report, of \n1,449 tonnes, are around twice the equivalent volumes in the UCE Original PS \nReports, of 744 tonnes.167  \n \n162  The same volumes are used in the UCE Original PS DCF Report, the UCE Original PS Cap \nReport, and the Veritas Original PS Report.  \n163  TA-JS, ¶ 7.18 . \n164  TA-JS, ¶ 7.17.  \n165  MB1 -TA, ¶ A7.9; and TA -JS, ¶ 7.17.  \n166  The relevant valuation dates  were 31 December 2015 ( the BT Original PS Repor"}

As a practical matter, I implement this constraint in my DCF analysis by \nlimiting the return on new invested capital (RONIC) in the t erminal period of my \nexplicit forecast to equal my assessment of the cost of capital plus a premium of \n1%, i.e., 18.5%.178  \n6.28 Mr Kaczmarek considers that his model already reflects the profitability of the \nPetrol Stations without the need for an adjustment to  constrain the RONIC. In the \nsubsections below, I explain: (i) why it is necessary to consider the RONIC; (ii) why \nit is appropriate to constrain the RONIC required in my DCF valuation of the Petrol \nStations; and (iii) my assessment of an appropriate long -term RONIC.  \nWhy is it necessary to consider the RONIC?  \n6.29 The return on new invested capital (or RONIC) measures how efficiently a \ncompany manages the capital it invests, and whether it generates positive returns \non those investments.  \n6.30 The assumed relationsh ip between the RONIC and the cost of capital is an \nimportant consideration because if an asset or business can generate a RONIC \ngreater than its cost of capital, this implies that it is delivering returns to its \nproviders of capital in excess of the return s they require to invest in the business \n(in the context of the risk of the business).  \n6.31 For competitive industries, market conditions should act, at least in the long term, \nto eliminate or constrain these excess profits (because persistently high returns \nwill attract the attention of competitors, customers, suppliers, or regulators).  \n \n176  For example, Mr Kaczmarek’s cross -check assumes an average tank size of 20 gallons, \nwhile my research supports a tank size between 12 and 16 gallons. Sources: BK2, Table 4; \nand Exhibit MB -B130: Multiple websites, Typical tank volume of cars.  \n177  Mr Kaczmare k assumes a conversion rate of 227 gallons/m3, similar to that of 220 \ngallons/m3 for imperial gallons (compared to 264 gallons/m3 for US gallons).

I consider that other large petrol station operators \nand owners in Ukraine, such as OKKO and WOG,186 have sufficient resources to be \nable to build a petrol station near to an incumbent Privat  Group  petrol station and \noffer competitive prices to compete for business. I do not consider that an \nincumbent petrol station will have material benefits from being a first mover.  \n6.39 My view app ears consistent with the views of the operators of the petrol stations \nthat Mr Kaczmarek  valued in the Crimean Arbitrations  (discussed in Section 7). Mr \nLaber, who was responsible for managing all financial and commercial aspects of \nthe petrol stations owned by the claimants in th e Stabil A rbitration,187 stated that \nmanagement had approved renovation of 19 petrol stations in response to “ new \nentrants into the Crimean market [who]  built new stations or modernised old \nones ”.188 In addition to prices, petrol stations are also likely to compete in other \nareas, such as fuel quality. Both OKKO and WOG are known as ‘premium’ brands, \nproviding higher quality fu el than Privat Group stations , which is less damaging to \nvehicle engines.189 In Ukraine, fuel quality is a key driver of demand.190 New petrol \nstations may therefore be able to attract customers who would select a premium \noption given a choice, which did not previously exist.   \n6.40 Mr Kaczmarek also considers that businesses that depend on their physical \nlocation can sustain excess return s for extended periods of time,191 and that the \nprofitability of a petrol station is highly dependent on its location.192  \n6.41 I ass"}

It is not the case that businesses are highly valuable simply \nbecause they have limited competition or because they opened fir st. For example, \na village shop may simply have a small number of potential customers.  \n6.43 Even in locations with higher demand, I consider  that the low barriers to entry in \nthe petrol station industry mean that any excess profits will soon be eroded by \ncompet itors.194 \n6.44 Figure 6-3 below is a map showing the E50 main road in Dnipro. Along this single \n1.4km stretch of road  there  are seven petrol stations operated by four different \nfirms, being OKKO, WOG, AMIC and Avias (which is part of the Privat Group). \nBased on the addresses provi ded to me , this does not appear to be one of the 246 \nPetrol Stations.

These petrol stations include one of the \nPetrol Stations I am instructed to value , operated by ANP .196  \n6.45 I consider that it would be unlikely that such situation s would arise if new \nentrants are deterred by incumbent operators. If the benefit of be ing the \nincumbent operator is as great as Mr Kaczmarek suggests, I would expect that the \nfirst petrol station to have opened on this road would have gradually added \ncapacity to satisfy demand which, on Mr Kaczmarek’s reasoning , would have \ndeterred all new entrants. This does not, however, appear to have been the case. \nInstead, the petrol station market appears to be competitive.  \n \n193  PB0129377_00001, slide 4.  \n194  TA-JS, ¶ 7.23; Figure 6-3. \n195  Although shown by a single symbol in Figure 6-4 below, there are ANP petrol stations on \nboth sides of the road.  \n196  FTI ID #248.

In a recorded lecture on the assessment of \nterminal value, Professor Damodaran explains:197 \n“My rule of thumb with return on capital [i.e. RONIC]  and stable growth \nis for 80% of companies I go to the default. The default is to set it equal \nto the cost of capital [i.e. the WACC] . For 1 in 5 companies where I think \nthat the competitive advantages are large and significant, I will leave the \nreturn on capital above the cost of capital by maybe 2% or 3%.”  \n6.48 Professor Damodaran’s view is that, for the majority of companies, terminal \nperiod RONIC should be set equal to the WACC. This is consistent with McKinsey’s \nview that “ economic theory suggests that comp etition will eventually eliminate \nabnormal returns, so for many companies, set ROIC [i.e., return on invested \ncapital]  equal to  WACC ”.198  \n6.49 As I explain above, I do not consider  that the Petrol Stations possess a substantial \nlong -term competitive advantage in the market.  \n6.50 In my DCF analysis, I assume  that the Petrol Stations will be able to achieve \npremium returns of 1% over the cost of capital. This may overstate their value if \nthey c annot maintain a competitive advantage in the long run , as is the case for \nthe majority of firms,  but is less than Professor Damodaran’s 2% or 3% premium \nhe applies for firms that have “ large and significant ” long term competitive \nadvantages.  \n6.51 I consider  that my assumption of a long -term RONIC equal to the cost of capital \nplus 1% is a reasonable assessment of the likely profitability of the Petrol Stations.   \n6.52 As explained in my First Report, for presentational reasons only, I have applied \nthis assumption by increasing capital expenditure in the explicit period,199 rather \nthan, for example, reduced profit margins or an increase in working capital.  \n \n197  Exhibit MB -B12: Online  lecture by Professor Damodaran, 25 August 2014.  \n198  By definition, a business’s terminal period RONIC is approximately equal to its ROIC in the \nlong term. Exhibit MB -B131: Extracts from McKinsey, Measuring and Managing the Values \nof Companies, fifth edition, page 216 . \n199  Mr Kaczmarek states that “ I find Mr Bezant’s assumption that the Petrol Stations would \nmake investments that did not have a direct economic return to be illogical ” (BK2,  ¶ 79). \nMr Kaczmarek’s view is contradicted by the petrol station s he valued in the Stabil \nArbitration . For two petrol stations, he forecast renovations to be undertaken which did \nnot increase the petrol stations’ sales (Exhibit MB -B132: Tribunal award, Stabil et al. v. \nRussian Federation,  12 April 2019,  ¶ 325).  \nD26/1/84\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 85 Country risk premium  \n6.53 As discussed in my First Report, discounting cash flows to a valuation dat"}

Mr Kaczmarek and I both rely on the CAPM to \nassess the cost of equity.  \n6.54 We also both include a premium in our cost of equity calculation to account for \nthe incr emental risks of the Petrol Stations being located in Ukraine rather than a \nmarket such as the US. This premium is the CRP. All else equal, a higher CRP leads \nto a lower valuation.  \n6.55 Mr Kaczmarek and I disagree on the appropriate CRP. We also disagree on ot her \nelements of the cost of equity calculation, but these other differences largely \noffset one another so that they have little net effect.200 We also disagree on the \nappropriate cost of debt, although in part this difference is driven by the different \ncurrency in which we perform our valuations.201 \n6.56 I assess the CRP for the Petrol Stations to be 7.6%, based on the sovereign yield \nspread of Ukrainian government bonds in March 2016, as published by Duff & \nPhelps.202 Mr Kaczmarek disagrees with my assessment, and , in particular: (i) the \nuse of the sovereign yield spread as a proxy for country risk; and (ii) the exposure \nof the Petrol Stations to country risk.203 \n6.57 Mr Kaczmarek instead uses a CRP of 3% for the Petrol Stations, based on his \nqualitative analysis of vari ous components of country risk, including currency, \nmacroeconomic and social risks.204 \n6.58 Mr Kaczmarek considers that my preferred CRP is overstated. He suggests that his \nlower CRP of 3% is sufficient on the basis that the application of such a CRP causes \na reduction in his valuation of 18% .205 Whether such a discount is sufficient will \ndepend on the extent of the risks to which a petrol station in Ukraine is exposed, \non which Mr Kaczmarek and I disagree.  \n \n200  TA-JS, ¶ 6.6. \n201  TA-JS, ¶ 6.8.  \n202  Duff & Phelps is a global valuation and corporate financial advisor.

To assess this,  \nit would be necessary to compare the value of an asset in Ukraine with the value \nof a s imilar asset in another countr y. One way to do so is to compare the value of \nUkrainian companies to companies in other countries, adjusted for the relative \nscale of the two sets of companies (i.e. , by comparing valuation multiples). An \nanalysis of the valu ation multiples of listed Ukrainian companies suggests that it is \ncommon for Ukrainian companies to trade at much larger discounts than 18% \nrelative to listed companies in other countries. For example, the median multiples \nof Ukrainian listed companies in 2016 were around 80% to 90% lower than the \nmultiples of companies listed on the FTSE 100.206  \n6.60 I consider Mr Kaczmarek’s CRP assessment to be understated, and mine \nappropriate, for the following reasons.  \n6.61 First , Mr Kaczmarek’s assessment is based on a purely qualitative assessment of \neach risk component, with no supporting quantitative analysis or indication of \nhow he arrived at his concluded premium .207 My approach relies on explicit data \npoints from multiple sources (as discussed below) to inform my assessmen t.  \n6.62 Second , Mr Kaczmare"}

For example, in a (now public) valuation \nreport from 2014, he stated that:209 \n“Country r isk is comprised of six factors associated with doing business in \na particular country: 1) currency risk, 2) local market risk, 3) social risks, \n4) political risks, 5) regulatory risks, and 6) legal risks .” (emphasis added ) \n \n206  See MB1 -SP, Appendix 6: (i ) EV/Revenue multiples 0.2x / 2.2x – 1 = (91%); (ii)  EV/EBITDA \nmultiples 1.7x / 12.0x – 1 = (86%); (iii) EV/EBIT multiples 2.3x / 16.3x – 1 = (86%); and (iv) \nP/BV multiples 0.5x / 2.9x – 1 = (83%).

The risk of conflict between Ukraine and Russia was high in \n2016, with the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, suggesting that \n“preparation s for conventional conflict between Russia and Ukraine [were]  \naccelerating, and the likelihood of open war [was]  increasing rapidly ”.210 \n6.65 Legal risk relates to investors’ ability to enforce their shareholder rights. A \nnational survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in 2015 found that \nonly 3.1% of respondents had trust in the Ukrainian judicial system and only 3.8% \nconsidered that the judiciary was willing to overcome corruption – the lowest \nrating of any branch of the Ukrainian government.211 \n6.66 Regulatory risk relates to the existence, or lack thereof, of laws and regulations in \na country affecting the operations of a business. In 2015, the regulatory quality \nranking of Ukraine, as ass essed by the Worldwide Governance Indicator \n(“WWGI ”) of the World Bank , was around 70% lower than that of the United \nKingdom.212 \n6.67 I therefore consider the premium for political, legal and regulatory risk to be \nsubstantial for the Petrol Stations in 2016.

Professor Damodaran accounts for this by \napplying a scaling factor greater than 1 to default s preads to calculate his CRPs.215 \nDuff & Phelps ’ calculation , on which I rely, does not apply such an adjustment. \nThe CRP I rely upon is therefore lower than assessments which incorporate such \nan adjustment.     \n6.72 Fourth , Mr Kaczmarek considers that “ country r isk cannot be uniformly applied to \nall companies ”,216 before suggesting that petrol stations have limited exposure to \ncountry risk. I agree that different firms and assets can have differing exposure to \ncountry risk, but I do not agree that petrol stations have limited exposure. By the \nnature of their immovable, asset -heavy operations they are more exposed to \nmany facets of country risk than assets that are easily moveable such as aircraft. \nFor instance, physical assets are at greater risk of expropriation a nd physical \ndamage in conflicts.  \n6.73 Further, Mr Kaczmarek’s opinion is contrary to the assumption in his DCF \nvaluation that forecast growth in petrol station sales volumes will be in line with \nreal GDP growth, meaning that they are tied to the performance of  the general \nUkrainian economy with the same average level of exposure as the economy \ngenerally.  \n6.74 Fifth , as shown in Table 6-3 below, my adopted CRP is at the lower end of CRP \nassessments by: (i) the valuers who prepared contemporaneous valuation reports \nof the Petrol Stations and OSFs; (ii) other valuation practitioners, including \nProfessor Damodaran, who Mr Kaczmarek and I rely  upon for our petrol station \nbeta and gearing assumptions , and respondents to a survey administered by \nProfessor Pablo Fernandez, a professor in the Department for Financial \nManagement at the University of Navarra (“ Professor Fernandez ”); and \n(iii) investm ent analysts covering larg"}

Petrol Stations – Market approach  \nIntroduction  \n7.1 Mr Kaczmarek and I both use the market approach to value the Petrol Stations, \nalthough we d o so in different ways. I use the implied value per petrol station \nfrom market transactions, auction sales prices, and cost estimates to expand \nexisting networks by building new petrol stations as a cross -check  of my \nconcluded values,217 whereas Mr Kaczmare k attributes a 50% weighting of his \noverall valuation to his market transactions analysis  (with the other 50% \nweighting attributed to his DCF analysis) . My valuation is based solely on DCF \nanalysis.  \n7.2 Mr Kaczmarek concludes, based on his market approach, tha t the total value of \nthe Petrol Stations is USD 307.5m, or UAH 8.4bn.218 This is 32% higher than the \nOriginal 2016 Value and 351% higher than the Restated 2016 Value, as shown in \nFigure 7-1 below.219 It is also 347% higher than my valuation of the Petrol Stations \nusing DCF analysis.220 \n \n217  MB1 -TA, Appendix 10.  \n218  Converted using the prevailing exchange rate of 27.187 UAH/USD as at Mr Kaczmarek’s \nvaluation date of 31 December 2016.

I \nexplain that:  \n(1) the method by which Mr Kaczmarek has used his transaction analysis to \narrive at his concluded market approach value is not appropriate. Of the \nthree main statistics to which he refers, one relies on a simple average \nwhich I do not consider informative, and another relies on a transaction \nwhich I do not consider sufficiently comparable to the Petrol Stations . This \nleaves the lowest of the three reference points  (which is a weighted \naverage) ; but \n(2) in estimating the values implied by the transactions  which feed into this \ncalculation  (and his calculation of the simple average) , Mr Kaczmarek has \nnot adjusted  for: \n(a) changes in exchange rates between the dates of the re levant \ntransactions and his valuation date; or  \n(b) the differences in the characteristics of the individual petrol stations. \nWhile I do not have enough information to control for this, it appears \nlikely that the values implied by Mr Kaczmarek’s petrol sta tion \ntransactions will provide an upper bound on the value of the Petrol \nStations.  \n7.6 As I explain below, adjusting Mr Kaczmarek’s analysis for changes in exchange \nrates over time results in a value per petrol station between his DCF valuation and \nmy own, al though closer to mine.222 I consider that adjusting for other factors, \nsuch as the location of the Petrol Stations, would bring this value further towards \nmy assessment.223     \nMr Kaczmarek’s transaction analysis  \n7.7 Mr Kaczmarek has identified 28 transactions i nvolving petrol stations in Eastern \nEurope which completed between 2008 and 2018.224 From this list, he excludes \ntransactions: (i) occurring prior to 2012; (ii) occurring after his valuation date of \n31 December 2016; and (iii) for which he is unable to iden tify a transaction price.  \n7.8 This results in 14 transactions. Mr Kaczmarek converts the transaction prices to \nUSD using the exchange rate at completion of the transaction.  \n \n222  Figure 7-3. \n223  The transactions upon which Mr Kaczmarek relies often involve petrol stations located: \n(i) in cities rather than villa ges, unlike the majority of the 246 Petrol Stations; and (ii) in \nless risky countries than Ukraine. Both factors, all else  equal , will lead to higher values for \nthe assets involved in the transactions than the 246 Petrol Stations.  \n224  BK2,  Table 14.  \nD26/1/92\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 93 7.9 Using these transactions, Mr Kaczmarek calculates:225 \n(1) a weighted average price per petrol station of USD 1.1m (weighted by the \nnumber of petrol stations in each transaction); and  \n(2) a simple average price per petrol station of USD 1.6m (which does not \naccount for the number of petrol stations in each transaction).  \n7.10 On this basis, Mr Ka czmarek concludes on a value per Petrol Station of \nUSD  1."}

USD 1.6m  \nto c. USD 1.4m .230 \n7.15 I do not consider it appropriate to give equal weighting to transactions for \nindividual petrol stations where the value of that petrol station will be more \nsignificantly dictated by the specific characteristics of that petrol station, as \ncompared to a transaction for a portfolio of petrol stations.   \nThe transaction between Lukoil and AMIC is not a reliable indicator of value  \n7.16 Mr Kaczmarek  places most weight on the sale of 240 petrol stations and six oil \nstorage facilities in Ukraine by Lukoil to AMIC, which completed in April 2015. I do \nnot consider that this transaction is a good guide to the value of the Petrol \nStations in December 2016 for the following reasons.  \n7.17 First , sources  indicate that average petroleum volumes for AMIC stations in 2016 \nwere around 25% higher than average Privat stations.231  \n7.18 Second , AMIC, along with operators such as WOG and OKKO, is a ‘ premium ’ brand \ncompared to t hose in the Privat network.232 These operators provide higher \nquality fuel to consumers, and accordingly charge higher prices. This would be \nexpected to increase their profitability and value relative to lower quality  brands, \nalthough  I do not have enough i nformation to quantify this difference.  \n7.19 Third , the transaction was completed in April 2"}

As I explain \nbelow, I consider that Mr Kaczmarek’s conclusions are overstated for further \nreasons.  \nMy comments on Mr Kaczmarek’s approach to his transaction analysis  \n7.21 I disagree with Mr  Kaczmarek’s transaction analysis because he has not accounted \nfor: \n(1) significant movements in the UA H/USD exchange rate between the \ntransaction dates and his valuation date. He assumes that, despite material \nchanges in exchange rates, the Petrol Stations would have held their values \nin USD rather than UAH terms. As explained in Section 5, I disagree with \nthis assumption; and  \n(2) differences between the petrol stations involved in his transactions and the \nPetrol Stations to be valued. He has not, for example, confirmed that the \nvolumes sold by these two sets of petrol stations are similar .234  \n7.22 I discuss these points in turn below. First, I give two example s that I consider show \nthat it is not appropriate for Mr Kaczmarek to give the results of his market \napproach a 50% weighting in his conclusions.  \n7.23 First , Mr Kaczmarek states that he considers transactions that occurred before \n2012 to be “ too outdated to be useful in establishing ” the value of the Petrol \nStations.235 One of the transactions that he identifie d (and  which  forms part of his \nconcluded averages) is Unipetrol RPA’s acquisitio n of 68 petrol stations from OMV \nin the Czech Republic in January 2016.236 In the notes contained within his market \napproach appendix, Mr  Kaczmarek states “ [I]n 2016, the Fair Value of these \nstations plus a wind park and cushion gas was EUR 260 million. It is not possible to \nuntangle the Fair Values for these 3 asset groups ”.237  \n \n234  For example, see ¶ 7.17 .  \n235  BK2, ¶ 171.  \n236  BK2,  Appendix E, tab ‘ E.1_Petro l Network Transactions ’, and Exhibit BK -44, pdf page 53.  \n237  BK2,  Appendix E, tab ‘ E.1_Petrol Network Transactions ’, note [14].

However, the source of Mr Kaczmarek’s purchase price is a press report \nthat states “ the value of the deal was not disclosed however figures from Reuters \nsuggest that it could be as much ass [sic] $161 m illion ”.239 \n7.25 This means that the third -highest  transaction price per petrol station on which \nMr Kaczmarek relies is an estimated upper -end price from  a press report from  \n2005, rather than an actual price from 2012 to 2016 as is used in the remainder of \nhis a nalysis.  \n7.26 Second , as stated above, the highest price per station transaction presented by \nMr Kaczmarek is NIS (Serbia)’s  acquisition of a single petrol station in Belgrade  in \nJuly 2014.240 In his list of transactions, Mr  Kaczmarek also includes  NIS Serbia ’s \nacqui sition of  five petrol stations in July 2015, four in Bulgaria and one in \nSerbia.241 However, from Mr  Kaczmarek’s underlying source documents I \nunderstand that this transaction  actual ly consisted of: (i) the acquisition of four \nBulgarian petrol stations in June 2014; and (ii) the acquisition of the single Serbian \npetrol station in July 2014 that he analyses separately .242  \n7.27 In doing so, Mr Kaczmarek has:  \n(1) increased his averages by inc luding the highest value per petrol station \ntransaction twice; and  \n(2) converted  the transaction to USD at a date  unrelated to this transaction . \n7.28 I consider that the above examples reduce the reliability of Mr Kaczmarek’s \nmarket approach, which he considers  to be ‘ robust ’.243 \nMr Kaczmarek has not accounted for significant movements in exchange rates \nbetween the transaction dates and his valuation date   \n7.29 Over the period Mr Kaczmarek considers for his analysis (2012 to 2016), the UAH \ndepreciated significantly ag ainst the USD, as shown in Figure 7-2 below.  \n \n238  It is not clear if these 70 petro l stations are the same as the 68 petrol stations sold in 2016. \nMr Kaczmarek’s source states that after the October 2005 transaction, OMV had 216 \npetrol stations in the Czech Republic (Exhibit BK -44: pdf page 55).  \n239  Exhibit BK -44: pdf page 55.  \n240  This is shown in row 13 of BK2,  Appendix E, tab ‘ E.1_Petrol Network Transactions ’. \n241  This is shown in row 19 of BK2,  Appendix E, tab ‘ E.1_Petrol Network Transactions ’. \n242  See Exhibit BK -45: pdf page 750. T he name of the acquire e, date and purchase \nconside ration for the Serbian station match es those set at Mr Kaczmarek’s source for the \ntransaction for the Serbian station  only  (Exhibit BK-45, pdf pages 679  and 680).    \n243  BK2, ¶ 168.  \nD26/1/96\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 97 Figure 7-2: UAH -USD exchange rate, 201 2 to 2016  \n \nSource: Appendix 5, tab ‘Transactions’ . \n \n7.30 By relying on USD denominated transaction prices, Mr Kaczmarek assumes that \nthe Petrol Stations (which are located in Ukraine) hold their value in USD terms \nover the period.

Currency depreciation can \nbe caused by factors such as economic fundamentals, political instability and risk \naversion among investors. None of these factors suggest that, as Mr  Kaczm arek’s \nanalysis does, the value of petrol stations in Ukraine would hold constant in USD \nterms over this period (or even in UAH terms). Conversely, I consider that the \nconsiderable economic difficulty causing the depreciation would have  decrease d \nthe value of businesses in Ukraine.  \n05101520253035\nDec-11 Dec-12 Dec-13 Dec-14 Dec-15 Dec-16My valuation dateMr Kaczmarek's valuation date Valuation date of the \nCrimean arbitrations\nDate of transactions \nrelied on by \nMr Kaczmarek\nD26/1/97\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 98 7.32 I would expect that an asset such as an aircraft located in Ukraine might hold its \nvalue in USD as the UAH weakens against the USD. This is because, if the \nweakening of the currency adversely affects the aircraft’s potential  to generate \nthe same income as it did previously (expressed in UAH or another currency), it \ncan be relocated to another country. However, a petrol station cannot be moved. \nIf the UAH depreciates , this generally indicates worsening economic conditions \ncomp ared to the USD (such as high inflation, economic decline, or political \nturmoil). To the extent this affects living standards or business and consumer \nconfidence in the country, this would  adversely affect demand for petrol (priced \nin UAH). This w ould  also translate into lower income at the Petrol Stations, \nexpressed in UAH, and hence lower USD -based values. It is for this reason that, as \nexplained in Section 5, I consider it more appropriate to value the Petrol Stations \nin UAH than USD.  \n7.33 The effect of Mr Kaczmarek’s approach can be seen by taking one of his \ntransactions as an example. The transaction between NIS (Serbia) and OMV, \nwhich completed on 28  February 2013, had a reported price per petrol station of \nRSD 209m (being an amount in Serbian Dinar).244 This equates to a price per \nstation of:   \n(1) UAH 20.0m , when converted from RSD 209m as at 28 February 2013 (the \ndate of this transaction); but count erintuitively  \n(2) UAH 66.9m under Mr Kaczmarek’s approach, when converted first from \nSerbian Dinar to USD 2.5m at the date of the transaction, then from USD to \nUAH as at 31 December 2016 (Mr  Kaczmarek’s valuation date).  \n7.34 Table 7-1 below summarises the differences between the two approaches for all \nthe transactions Mr Kaczmarek considers  (ordered chronologically ).

I do not consider this plausible.  \n7.36 I have updated Mr Kaczmarek’s transaction analysis to convert sales prices to UAH \nat each trans action date.245 As shown in Figure 7-3 below, the effect of doing so is \nto reduce the weighted average price per petrol station that Mr  Kaczmarek \ncalculates from USD 1.1 m, equal to UAH 30m when converted as at \nMr Kaczmarek’s valuation date, to UAH  18m. This falls between Mr Kaczmarek’s \nDCF assessment (UAH 35m) and my own (UAH  8m), although closer to my \nassessment . This is before accounting for the issues I discuss next.  \nFigure 7-3: Effect on Mr Kaczmarek’s weighted average price per petrol station \nof adjusting his transaction analysis (UAH million)  \n \nNote: Mr Kaczmarek’s market valuation per petrol station of UAH 34m is simi lar to \nhis DCF valuation per petrol station of UAH 35m.  \nSource: Appendix 5, tab ‘Figures for report’.  \n \n245  When doing so, I assume that the OMV -Unipetrol transaction took place in 2005 rather \nthan 2016 (see ¶ 7.23 ).  \n0510152025303540\nMr Kaczmarek\n(DCF & Market)Mr Kaczmarek\ntransactions USD\n(Market)Mr Kaczmarek\ntransactions UAH\n(Market)Mr Bezant (DCF)\nD26/1/100\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 101 Mr Kaczmarek has not adjusted  for differences between the petrol stations \ninvolved in his transactions and the Petrol Stations to be valued  \n7.37 A market -based valuation involves applying valuation ratios for comparable assets \nor companies to a subject asset. Such ratios typically express the value of the \nasset relative to a measure of its scale.  \n7.38 The purpose of applying valuation multiples, rather  than relying directly on the \nvalue of comparable assets, is to account for differences between the financial \nand operating performance of different assets.

Otherwise, I  consider that, if \nother more asset -specific valuation approaches like a DCF are available, the \nmarket approach should only be used as a cross -check (which was my approach in \nmy First Report), rather than  as a primary valuation approach.  \n \n246  Exhibit MB -B141: IFRS 13 Basis of Conclusions  and Illustrative Examples : ¶ 39. \n247  Exhibit MB -B142: IVS 2017, Market Approach Methods: ¶ 30.8. Although IVS 105 was \nintroduced after my valuation date, I consider that its content reflected standard valuation \npractice prior to its introduction.  \nD26/1/101\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 102 7.41 Mr Kaczmarek has not calculated valuation multiples from the transactions he \nidentifies (although I note that he may not have enough information to calculate a \nmeaningful multiple ). Instead, he has simply assessed a value per petrol station, \nwithout adjusting for operation al or financial differences between petrol stations. \nThe operational and financial performance of a petrol station can be affected by: \n(i) location; (ii) size, facilities, and standard of the typical petrol station in the \ncountry in question; (iii) prevail ing macroeconomic conditions;  (iv) whether \nstandard or premium fuel is sold;  and (v) market dynamics, including the oil price \nand level of competition. These factors will vary between individual countries, \npetrol stations, and over time.  \n7.42 As a simple illust ration, a petrol station with 10 pumps in an urban centre selling \nhigh volumes of petrol is likely to be significantly more valuable than a petrol \nstation with a single pump in a rural location, attracting few customers and selling \nminimal volumes. Mr  Kacz marek has not accounted for such differences.  \n7.43 Differences can impact valuations both within countries, and between different \ncountries. When previously instructed to value a portfolio of assets in  the Crimea n \nArbitrations , Mr Kaczmarek concluded on very di fferent average valuations for \npetrol stations owned by Ukrnafta (USD 3.1m) and LLC Stabil and others (“ Stabil ”) \n(USD 1.5m). This indicates that even on the same date within a single region \nwithin one country, different characteristics will materially affe ct petrol station \nvalues such that some petrol stations might be worth more than double other \npetrol stations.248  \n7.44 The petrol station transactions on which Mr Kaczmarek relies for his market \nanalysis in this litigation took place across multiple countries o ver a period of five \nyears . As I identify in Section 8 , the tribunal in the Stabil Arbitration  found that \nthe value of the petrol stations that were the subject of th at arbitration increased \nas a result of valuing them assuming they were exposed to Russian  economic \nconditions, as opposed to Ukrainian economic conditions.249 \n7.45 I consider that caution must be taken when considering transactions "}

I have ordered these brands from highest to lowest \naverage volume. As shown, while the Privat Group operated more petrol stations \nthan any other Ukrainian brand, its average sales volumes per petrol station were \nlower than those of any brand for which Naftogaz reported this information.  \nTable 7-2: Comparison of 2016 average gasoline and diesel volumes sold  \nNetwork \noperato r Volume  Petrol stations  Average volume per \npetrol station  \n  million tonnes  # tonnes  \nOKKO  0.5 420 1,200  \nWOG  0.4 415 1,012  \nBRSM  0.1 175 800 \nUkrnafta  0.4 537 730 \nAMIC  0.1 230 487 \nPrivat  0.4 1,021  384 \nOther  0.8 n/a n/a \nTotal  2.8     \nSource: MB1 -TA, Appendix 10a, tab ‘Volumes’.  \n7.48 While I do not have full information on the volumes sold by the petrol stations  \ninvolved in the transactions upon which Mr Kaczmarek relies , I have identified \nthat:  \n(1) the single petrol station acquired by NIS (Serbia) for RSD 332m was located \nnext to a business centre in Serbia’s capital, Belgrade. Conversely, the \nmajority of the Petrol Stations are located in villages, as discussed in Section \n6. I would expect demand for fuel to be significantly lower in a vil lage than \nin a capital city; and  \n(2) the 190 petrol stations sold to Eni by MOL for HUF 31bn were mainly \nlocated in Hungary,250 rather than Ukraine. As shown in Table 7-3 below, \nHungary has around 40% higher population density and 40% more cars per \npetrol station than Ukraine, which I would expect to lead to higher sales \nvolume s.  \n \n250  173 petrol stations were located in Hungary and 17 were located in Slovenia.

However, as \nexplained above, there are reasons to expect that Privat petrol stations in general \nmay be less valuable than ma ny of the petrol stations involved in the transactions \non which Mr Kaczmarek relies.  \n \n251  As explained in ¶ 8.29 , I do not have access to equivalent Duff & Phelps data for 2014, on \nwhich I rely for my 2016 CRP assessment.  \nD26/1/104\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 105 7.51 Given this, I would expect the transactions on which Mr Kaczmarek relies to \nprovide an upper bound on the value of the Petrol Stations, since the adjustments \nI would imple ment to make them comparable to the Petrol Stations tend to \ndecrease their stated value.252  \n7.52 As I explained in my First Report, two of the Petrol Stations I am instructed to \nvalue were auctioned in June and July 2020.253 Unlike the transactions upon which \nMr Kaczmarek relie s, these transactions are in petrol stations that are the subject \nof my valuations .  \n7.53 As shown in Table 7-5 below, the sale prices of the two Petrol St ations in 2020 are \nsimilar to my assessed values, and significantly lower than Mr  Kaczmarek’s \nvaluations .254 \nTable 7-5: Valuations of auctioned Petrol Stations (UAH million)  \nLocation  Kherson region, \nSkadovsky  Kherson Region, \nTsyurupynsk  \nFTI ID#  162 101 \nAuction price  (2020)  13.0  11.5  \nMy valuation  (2016)  9.4 8.8 \nMr Kaczmarek’s valuation  \n(2016)  54.3  35.5  \nSource: MB1 -TA, Table 2 -3; and BK2, Appendix D.9.  \nConclusion  \n7.54 In addition to his DCF analysis, Mr Kaczmarek has relied on a market approach to \nvalue the Petrol Stations.

Mr Kaczmarek’s transaction analysis suggests that the \nweighted average price per petrol station nearly doubled from USD 1.1 m in the years 2012 \nto 2016, to USD 2.1m in the pandemic p eriod between December 2020 and January 2022 . \nSource: BK2, Appendix E, tab ‘ E.1_Petrol Network Transactions ’.  \nD26/1/105\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 106 7.56 Further, I consider t hat the analysis on which Mr Kaczmarek’s simple and \nweighted averages are based  is too simplistic to constitute an explicit valuation as \nhis concluded value is:  \n(1) overstated by performing his valuation in USD, not UAH; and  \n(2) in any event, overstated by  not adjusting for a series of factors such as: \n(i) the value of petrol stations in Ukraine versus other countries; and (ii) the \nvalue of petrol stations owned by the Privat Group versus other petrol \nstations in Ukraine.  \n7.57 After adjusting only for the curren cy of analysis (but not the petrol station \ncharacteristics), Figure 7-4 below illustrates that Mr Kaczmarek’s concluded UAH \nper Petrol Station value  is significantly  higher than the weighted average of the \ntransactions he has reviewed. The transactions are, alternatively, either in line \nwith or closer to my concluded value than Mr  Kaczmarek’s, notwithstanding the \nfact I consider these transactions to provide an upper bo und of value, since they \ndo not adjust for the characteristics of the Petrol Stations I have described above.  \n7.58 The only average transaction value that is above Mr Kaczmarek’s conclusion is the \nSerbian transaction for one petrol station which I discuss at pa ragraph 7.14 . \nFigure 7-4: Comparison of average transaction values (UAH million)  \n \nNote: Average transaction values are converted to UAH using the prevailing \nexchange rate as at the transaction date.

In \nparticular, many of the petrol stations in the Stabil Arbitration were \nassumed to under go renovation which in some instances result ed in \nsignificant value increases; and  \n(3) the different assumed jurisdictions of these assets. Mr Kaczmarek valued \nthe expropriated assets assuming that they were subject to the growth \nexpectations and risks of such assets in Russia, whereas the assets to be \nvalued in this litigation are in Ukraine.  \n8.8 I consider that not adjusting for the above factors and the use of differing \nvaluation methodologies means no significant weight can be placed on \nMr Kaczmarek’s cross -check. At the end of this section, I show that adjusting for \nthese factors reduces the value per petrol station awarded by the tribunal to a \nlevel broadly consistent with my valuation of the Petrol Stations, and significantly \nlower than  Mr Kaczmarek’s val uation.257 \n8.9 In addition to the factors listed above, Mr Kaczmarek adopted different valuation \napproaches in the previous arbitrations and this litigation. In the Crimean \nArbitration s, Mr Kaczmarek relied on the DCF and trading multiples approaches, \nwhereas i n this litigation he disregards the trading multiples approach, instead \nadopting  a transaction approach.  I do not know why his approach has differed.  \n8.10 In this section I focus on Mr Kaczmarek’s reliance on his cross -check when valuing \nthe Petrol Stations. My concerns regarding his reliance on this cross -check in \nrespect of petrol stations apply equally to his reliance on it in respect of oil \nstorage facil ities, as explained in Section 9 . \n \n256  BK2, ¶ 194.  \n257  As explained in Section 6, I consider that Mr Kaczmarek overstates the value of the Petrol \nStations because his valuation implies an undefined RONIC. From my review of the \nexhibited pdfs, I have the same concern regarding his prior valuation of the Crimean  petrol \nstations. However, for the purposes of this section I adopt the tribunal’s decision as given \nand do not adjust for this.  \nD26/1/110\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 111 Changes in the UAH/USD exchange rate between 2014 and 2016  \n8.11 When using the tribunal’s 2014 valuation to assess the reasonableness of his \nvaluation of the Petrol Stations as at 2016, Mr Kaczmarek compares:258 \n(1) the tribunal ’s valuation as at 22 April 2014,259 expressed in USD; with  \n(2) his valuation as at 31 December 2016, again expressed in USD.  \n8.12 As explained in Sections 5 and 7,260 I consider that the value of a petrol station in \nUkraine will change materially in USD terms if the UAH/USD exchange rate \nchanges materially. I consider that the valu es of petrol stations in Ukraine are \nlikely to have fallen in USD terms between 2014 and 2016 due to a weakening of \nthe UAH against the USD.   \n8.13 In my view, it is more appropriate to compare Mr Kaczmarek’s valuation to the \ntribunal’s award after converting e ach amount to UAH at the exchange rate \nprevailing on the relevant date.

For \ninstance, both sets of petrol stations valued by the tribunal were located in \nCrimea  and valued at t he same date , but the tribunal assessed the value per \npetrol station of the Ukrnafta petrol stations to be more than twice that of the \nStabil petrol stations. Mr  Kaczmarek and I agreed in the TA Joint Statement that \nthis suggests differences in specific ch aracteristics of petrol stations, even within a \nsingle country or region within a country, can have a material effect on value.261  \nDifferent characteristics of the petrol stations being valued  \n8.17 Due to the limited information available, I am unable to compar e in detail the \ncharacteristics of the Crimean petrol stations and the Petrol Stations. The \ninformation that is available suggests, however, that the Petrol Stations are likely \nto be less valuable than the Crimean petrol stations because, on the assumption  \nthat the volumes underlying the Restated 2016 Values are reasonable, they \nachieved lower sales volumes, and some of Stabil’s petrol stations underwent \nrenovations that increased their valuation significantly.  \nLower Petrol Station sales volumes  \n8.18 A significa nt factor affecting the value of a petrol station is the volume of fuel that \nit sells. To the extent possible, when assessing the reasonableness of a valuation \nof the Petrol Stations by reference to a previous valuation of other, different, \npetrol stations , it is necessary to adjust for any differences in sales volumes.  \n8.19 Of the petrol stations that Mr Kaczmarek valued  in the Crimean Arbitrations , 16 \nwere owned by Ukrnafta. The Petrol Stations that Mr Kaczmarek and I value in \nthis litigation were operated un der the Privat brand and other brands owned by \nthe Privat Group, such as Avias Plus.262 Average petroleum volumes sold in 2016 \nby Privat petrol stations were around half those sold by Ukrnafta branded petrol \nstations.263 This suggests that Privat petrol stations, on average, are likely to be \nsignificantly less valuable than Ukrnafta petrol stations.  \n8.20 I do not know the brand(s) under which the Stabil petrol stations were operated \nand so cannot compare their expected sales volumes to those of average Privat \npetrol stations. However, Privat petrol stations appear to have  had some of the \nlowest sales volumes of any brand of petrol stations operating in Ukraine.264 \n \n261  TA-JS, ¶ 7.28.  \n262  Exhibit M"}

Mr Kaczmarek’s pre -renovation \nvaluation per petrol station would have been USD 0.9m (compared to USD  1.5m \nafter).268 \nPhysica l location of petrol stations  \n8.23 Mr Kaczmarek and I agree that geographic location is one of the drivers of petrol \nstation profitability.269  \n8.24 At least 45% of petrol stations valued by Mr Kaczmarek in the Stabil Arbitration \nwere located in a city,270 whereas in this litigation  no more than  32% of petrol \nstations are located in cities.271 Therefore, all else equal, I consider the value of \nthe 246 Petrol Stations would likely be lower than the awarded value of Stabil’s \npetrol stations.  \n \n265  Exhibit MB -B132: Tribunal award, Stabil and Related Parties v.

For example, on average, the volumes \nunderlying the Restated 2016 Values are approximately 6 9% less than those \nsold by the expropriated Ukrnafta petrol stations in 2016.

OSFs  \nIntroduction  \n9.1 In our previous reports, Mr Kaczmarek and I valued the same 72 OSFs that are \npart of the Transferred Assets.  \n9.2 I am now instructed to value two additional OSFs in this report. I understand that \nMr Kaczmarek is instructed to value one additional OSF in his supplemental \nreport, although the TA Joint Statement does not record which OSF th is is.284   \n9.3 I set out my valuation of  the two additional OSFs in Appendix 7. I explain in this \nappendix that I use the same approach to valuing these two OSFs as I used to \nvalue the original 72 OSFs. In particular:  \n(1) for the OSF that was subsequently sold at auction  in 2019  (i.e. before the \nCOVID -19 pandemic) , I use the auction price; and  \n(2) for the OSF that was not subsequently sold at auction, I rely on the price \nper unit capacity of those OSFs that were sold at auction.  \n9.4 In this section, I comment on Mr Kaczmarek’s valuation of the initial 72 OSFs. \nMr Kaczmarek concluded on a value of UAH 2 ,370.4m for these OSFs as at \n31 December 2016, while I valued the m at UAH 520.5m as at 1 July 2016. I explain \nthat:285  \n(1) Mr Kaczmarek’s value is inconsistent with the auction sale prices of the \nsubset of OSFs sold at auction in 2019 ; \n(2) Mr Kaczmarek ass umes that the OSFs were largely operational in 2016, but \nthere is evidence that suggests this is not correct ;  \n(3) I disagree with the assumptions on which Mr Kaczmarek’s DCF calculation is \nbased. In particular:  \n(a) the throughput volumes that Mr Kaczmarek  relies upon from the BT \nOSF Report are inconsistent with information from other sources; \nand \n \n284  TA-JS, ¶ 2.4.   \n285  I comment on other aspects of Mr Kaczmarek’s valuation of the OSFs in Section 5. In \nparticular, in that section I explain that: (i) it is more app ropriate to value the OSFs in UAH, \nas opposed to USD which is Mr Kaczmarek’s approach; and (ii) I am not aware of any \nevidence to support Mr Kaczmarek’s view that the Bank has not managed the OSFs.  \nD26/1/120\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 121 (b) Mr Kaczmarek’s discount rate is, in my view, inappropriate because \nhe underestimates the Ukrainian CRP and so overstates the value of \nthe OSFs ; and \n(4) Mr Kaczmarek performs cross -checks of his valuations using a comparable \ntransaction multiple from the BT OSF Report, his valuation from the Stabil \nArbitration , Professor Damodaran’s industry average EV/EBITDA multiple, \nthe OSF values from the EY Report, and the NBU Values. I do not consider \nthat these cross -checks can be used to validate his valuation and consider \nthat their  use is selective because  Mr Kaczmarek does not : (i) refer to or \nrely on other valuation work whic h arrived at materially lower values; or \n(ii) address the fact that the EY Report and NBU sources upon which he \nrelies to support his OSF valuation"}

The se auctions completed  between December 2021 and \nFebruary 2022. They do not impact my conclusions because, consistent with \nmy First Report, I consider the COVID -19 pandemic may have affected the \ntransaction prices of the auctions from 2020 onwards, and ther efore rely \nonly on transaction prices for the OSFs which were sold at auction in 2019 \nfor my valuation of the OSFs. Nevertheless, I observe that, consistent with \nthe 42 OSFs sold at auction as of the date of my First Report, the aggregate \nauction proceeds  from  these 13 OSFs  more recently  sold at auction is \nsignificantly closer to the aggregate Restated 2016 Values for these OSFs \nthan their aggregate Original 2016 Values;  \n(2) the Veritas OSF Report; and  \n(3) shareholder resolution documents, related to the O SFs.  \n9.7 None of this information causes me to revise my valuation .  \nMr Kaczmarek’s conclusions on the value of the OSFs  \n9.8 Mr Kaczmarek valued the initial 72 OSFs at UAH 2,370.4m as at 31 December 2016 \nusing a DCF approach.286 I consider that this valuation is inconsistent with the \nauction sale prices of the subset of OSFs sold at auction in 2019.  \n \n286  Mr Kaczmarek first calculates a value of USD 87.2m for the 72 OSFs, then converts this to \nUAH 2,370.4m using a UAH/USD exchange rate of 27.2.

Mr Kaczmar ek has \nnot identified any reasons for the 89% decline in value that his valuation implies, \nother than his view that the Bank appears not to have managed the OSFs.290 \nHowever, a s explained in Section 5, I have seen no evidence to support this.  \nMr Kaczmarek’s assumption on the operational status of the OSFs  \n9.11 Mr Kaczmarek’s DCF relies on throughput volumes from the BT OSF Report.

Of the entire set of 149 OSFs \nconsidered by BT, only 13 were said to have no throughput in this period. As explained \nfurther below, it is unclear whether the volume data provided to BT was reliable.  \n293  Two of the four OSFs which the BT OSF Report indicated were not operational were sold at \nauction in 2019 (being the OSFs at “ Novy Bug, Ostrovskogo st., 1 ” and “ Kirovograd, \nMurmanskaya St , 39а” ). Mr Kaczmarek values the first of these OSFs at UAH 38.5m, \nsignificantly higher than its auction proceeds of UAH 1.8m. Mr Kaczmarek values the \nsecond of these OSFs at UAH 1.3m, slightly lower than its auction proceeds of U AH 1.9m. \nMr Kaczmarek’s aggregate value of UAH 39.8m for these two OSFs is significantly higher \nthan their aggregate auction proceeds of UAH 3.7m.

I consider that the feasibility of the OSFs serving the Petrol Stations will \ndepend on various factors as a practical matter, such as  the operational status of \nthe OSFs,  the geographic locations of the individual OSFs and Petrol Stations, the \namount of storage capacity at the Petrol Stations themselves, the frequency of \nfuel deliveries and the level of demand at the Petrol Stations.298 Depending on \nthese factors, it may or may not have be en possible for the OSFs to serve the \nPetrol Station s.   \n \n294  BK2, ¶ 36. \n295  BK2, ¶ 104; TA -JS, ¶ 8.9.  \n296  BK2, ¶¶ 36 and 102.  \n297  TA-JS, ¶ 8.9. \n298  TA-JS, ¶ 8.11.  \nD26/1/123\nConfidential  \n1"}

I have seen no evidence that th e transferred Petrol Stations have historically \nbeen serviced by the transferred OSFs, rather than other oil storage facilities \neither controlled by the Privat Group or by third parties. I note that t hese assets \nrepresent only a subset of the assets transf erred to the Bank, which in turn \nrepresents only a subset of the Privat Group’s petrol stations and oil storage \nfacilities, as shown in Table 9-1 below.  \nTable 9-1: Petrol stations and oil storage facilities transferred to the Bank  \n Petrol \nstations  Oil storage \nfacilities  \nHeld by Privat Group prior to transfer  1,021  >149  \nTransferred to Bank  248 120 \nValued in my First Report  246 72 \nPercentage valued of those held by Privat \nGroup  24%  <48%  \nSource: EY report, p age 13; The BT Original PS Report values 994 petrol stations, \nincluding 243 out of the 246 transferred ( MB1 -TA, ¶¶ A7.7 , A7.8 ), and the EY \nReport indicates the Privat Group has around 1,021 petrol stations \n(PB0217594_00001_English, page 108). The BT OSF Report values 149 oil storage \nfacilities, including the 72 transferred ( MB1 -TA, ¶ 5.20). \n9.17 As stated in Section 5 above, it appears that the Privat Group continued to \nmanage the Petrol Stations and OSFs as part of the larger group after their \ntransfer to the Bank . \n9.18 Notwithstanding this lack of evidence  that the transferred OSFs could or did \nservi ce the transferred Petrol Stations , I have reviewed the locations of the Petrol \nStations and the OSFs to see if this indicates whether the Petrol Stations could \nhave used the OSFs, if necessary , assuming that the OSFs were operational . While \nI do not have information to ascertain  a typical distance between an OSF and a \nPetrol Station that it may serve, I consider it unlikely that Petrol Stations will use \nOSFs that are located a long distance away . Ukraine is the second -largest country \nin Europe by geographi cal area (after Russia) and therefore it may not be \neconomical to use storage in different regions to a petrol station if the additional \ntransport costs  make that storage more expensive than using closer, third -party \nstorage facilities.  \n9.19 I have review ed the  locations of the Petrol Stations and OSFs using two methods:  \n(1) comparing the top five ‘Oblasts’ (or regions) in which the Petrol Stations are \nlocated to the  top five ‘Oblasts’ (or regions) in which the OSFs are located; \nand  \n(2) mapping and comparing t he location of the Petrol Stations and OSFs by \nOblast .   \nD26/1/124\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 125 9.20 In Table 9-2 below, I show the top five Oblasts in which the 246 Petrol Stations are \nlocated .  \nTable 9-2: Top five Oblasts  of the 246 Petrol Stations  \nOblast   Number of Petrol \nStations  Percentage of total Petrol \nStations  \nDnipropetrovsk  31 13%  \nSumy  26 11%  \nKharkiv  25 10%  \nKherson  15 6% \nZaporizhia  15 6% \nTotal in top five regions  112 46%  \nSource: Locations as reported in MB1 -TA, Appendix 3.  \n9.21 Table 9-2 above shows that the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast  contains the most Petrol \nStations , with Sumy , Kharkiv, Kherson and Zaporizhia containing the next most \nPetrol Sta"}

For example:301 \n(1) a 2017 report (which appears to be an internal Bank document discussing, \namong other things, some of the Transferred Assets, including OSFs) on  the \n“toxic assets of PrivatBank” gave examples of two oil storage facilities (at \nleast one of which was a transferred OSF302) which were “ unsuitable for \ncurrent operation ”; \n(2) Ms Kateryna Viktorivna Rozhkova (“Ms Rozhkova ”), the First Deputy \nGovernor of t he NBU, explains that a team from the NBU conducted an \nonsite inspection of the oil storage facilities in 2016, and that “ the \ninspection team had found these facilities in ruins ”.303 As a consequence of \nthis, t he NBU issued a letter to the Bank dated 2 July 2016  which  states that \nthe NBU checked more than 20 oil storage facilities that were transferred to \nthe Bank and established that at least some of these had not been in \nworking order for a long time;304  \n(3)  internal Bank documents indicat e that inspe ctions of at least 31 OSFs had \nbeen conducted (presumably by the Bank) before or around March 2017, \nfinding that at least 28 of these OSFs were not operational and only one \nOSF of the 31 inspected was operational . Of the 28 OSFs indicated to be \nnon-operati onal, the documents indicate d that at least 12 required \nremedial works to return them to operation, and that nine were ready for \noperation without remedial works ;305 and \n \n300  Mr Kaczmarek has also reviewed these documents, with the potential exception of \nMs Rozhkova’s witness statement.

As I explained in my First Re port:309  \n(1) there is uncertainty regarding the operational status of the OSFs at this \ntime, including whether it was economical to return any non -operational \nOSFs to operation (and if so, the cost of doing so) and whether the highest \nand best use of these  sites was as operational OSFs; and   \n(2) there is no information available on the OSFs’ historical or forecast financial \nperformance which might enable me to perform a DCF valuation of the \nOSFs.310  \n9.36 As I explained in my First Report, DCF analysis is usuall y appropriate for valuing \noperational, going concern businesses or assets whose future financial \nperformance can be forecasted. However, this is not the case for the OSFs \nbecause of the uncertainty concerning the operational status of the OSFs and the \nlack of historical or forecast financial performance of the OSFs.311 I therefore do \nnot agree with Mr Kaczmarek that it is appropriate to use the DCF approach to \nvalue the OSFs.   \n9.37 As I explained in my First Report and the TA Joint Statement, given the uncertain ty \nsurrounding the operational status of the OSFs (including that there are various \npieces of evidence that contradict the operational information contained in the BT \nOSF Report) and the difficulties with valuing the OSFs using a DCF approach or \ncomparable  companies analysis, I consider it appropriate to value the OSFs by \nreference to the prices at which a subset were subsequently sold"}

While the reliability of the data is a matter of \nfact for the Court to determine, if the throughput data pr ovided to BT is unreliable \n(as suggested by the other documents I have reviewed that contradict at least \npart of the data), then Mr Kaczmarek’s use of such data means that his valuation \nof the OSFs is also unreliable.  \nMr Kaczmarek’s assumptions based on the Stabil Arbitration  \n9.42 Mr Kaczmarek adopts three assumptions from his valuation of two oil storage \nfacilities in Crimea in the Stabil Arbitration :319 \n(1) a storage fee of 1.5% of the wholesale petrol price (equal to the gross profit \nmargin of operating the O SFs);  \n(2) an EBITDA margin of 49.0%; and  \n \n314  MB1 -TA, ¶ 5.23.  \n315  TA-JS, ¶ 8.16.  \n316  ¶¶ 9.27 , 9.28 . \n317  ¶¶ 9.29 , 9.30 . \n318  TA-JS, ¶ 8.16.  \n319  BK2, ¶¶ 200, 201, 202, Appendix D “D.2_Inputs” tab.    \nD26/1/131\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 132 (3) annual maintenance capital expenditure of 8.0% of storage revenues.   \n9.43 In support of his assumptions for the EBITDA margin and maintenance capital \nexpenditure, Mr Kaczmarek states that he “ had detailed historica l operating and \nfin"}

Having done so, the value from the Stabil Arbitration  will be \n60% lower than his valuation in this litigation  (before accounting for the \nother factors above) .346 \nCross -check to Professor Damodaran’s industry average multiple  \n9.59 Mr Kaczmarek calculates that his enterprise valuation of the OSFs of USD 87.2m \nimplies an EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.1x, based on his projected 2017 EBITDA for the \nOSFs of USD 10.8m. Mr Kaczmarek states that according to Professor Damodaran, \nthe industry aver age EV/EBITDA multiple for  the oil/gas distribution  industry  in \nemerging markets was 10.5x in 2016.347 \n \n344  BK2,  Exhibit BK -48, page 80.  \n345  In Mr Kaczmarek’s valuation of the Crimean oil storage facilities, adopting a CRP of 7.6% \n(rather than 2.0%) would increase Mr Kaczmarek’s USD cost of equity from 11.3% to \n16.9% and increase his discount rate from 8.1% to 11.0% ( BK2,  Exhibit BK -48, page 80).  All \nelse equal, this would decrease Mr Kaczmarek’s per -facility value of the two Crimean oil \nstorage faci lities by 9%, from UAH 1.17m to UAH 1.06m ( BK2,  Exhibit BK -48, page 1).  \n346  Converting the per -facility value of USD 1.17m for the Crimean facilities from USD to UAH, \nat the UAH/USD exchange of 11.25 as at the valuation date of 22 April 2014, results in a \nper-facility value of UAH 13.2m (13,155,188 = 1,169,350 * 11.25). Converting  the per -\nfacility value of USD 1.21m for the 72 OSFs from USD to UAH, at the UAH/USD exchange \nrate of 27.19 as at 31 December 2016, results in a per -facility value of UAH 32.9m \n(32,925,975 = 1,210,959 * 27.19). In UAH terms, Mr Kaczmarek’s per -facility val ue for the \nCrimean facilities is 60% lower than that for the 72 OSFs. (13,155,188 – 32,925,975) / \n32,925,975 = (60%).

I explain below that:  \n(1) both Mr Kaczmarek and I have very little information on the provenance of \nthe NBU Values and what verification of these values (if any) the NBU \nperformed;  \n(2) where the analys es underlying the NBU Values is available, this analysis is \noften flawed; and   \n(3) Mr Kaczmarek justifies his adoption of NBU Values by explaining that he is \nnot aware of what he termed any “ errors ” in the NBU’s analysis.372 \nHowever, in most cases, as far as I can tell, he has not interrogated the \nanalysis underlying these values and so it would not be possible for him to \nidentify  errors. In respect of the one asset (Hotel Zirka) where \nMr Kaczmarek has interrogated the analysis that arrived at a value close to \nthe NBU Value, he rejects the valuation as flawed and relies instead on my \nDCF and concludes on a lower value than adopted by the NBU.  \nLittle information is available on the provenance of the NBU Values  \n10.5 As I explained in my First Report, I have limited information on the provenance of \nthe NBU Values.373 I do not consider that, where such information is available to \nme, the NBU  Values are reliable, or that their association with the NBU should \nnecessarily afford them greater weight than other valuation evidence.  \n10.6 Mr Kaczmarek seems to have similarly limited information and provides no \nindication of the extent and nature of his un derstanding of any verification work \nundertaken by the NBU.

The \n2015 NBU Value of UAH  259m relied on by Mr Kaczmarek is based on the \nColliers 2015 Mir Report.

The most material \ndifference in respect of the real estate assets is in respect of Hotel Zirka. However, \nwhile Mr Kaczmarek’s conclu sions are more similar to my own in relation to the \nother real estate assets, I do not consider that his assessments or his basis for \narriving at them are reasonable. This is because, as explained above, \nMr Kaczmarek relies on the NBU Values without having  examined the underlying \nanalyses. I comment on Mr  Kaczmarek’s assessments of each of the real estate \nTransferred Assets below.  \nHotel Zirka  \n10.13  Hotel Zirka consists of two buildings: (i)  a building containing a 252 -room hotel; \nand (ii) a building for staff accommodation and several auxiliary facilities.385 \n10.14  In my First Report, my valuation of Hotel Zirka incorporated the value of the staff \nbuilding, such that no additional value should be a ttributed to it.  \n \n382  The CBRE 2016 Kyiv Report states that it valued the Kyiv Office in accordance with a \ntripartite agreement with the NBU and the Bank. However, the CBRE 2016 Kyiv Report \nvalues the office at UAH 207m, while the EY Report states that the NBU Value was \nUAH  245m (CBRE 2016 Kyiv Report, page 6; EY Report, page 171).

Further, this approach relies on figures from a report which \nMr Kaczmarek considers contains “ clear errors ”.389 \n10.17  I explain these points further  in Appendix 8 . I also set out my review of an \nadditional valuation report that has been provided to me since my First Report, \nmy review of which does not affect my conclusion.   \nHotel Mir  \n10.18  Hotel Mir is a hotel and office complex comprising two main buildin gs: (i) a 14 -\nstorey structure where the hotel operation is located; and (ii) a five -storey \nstructure that consists of office and commercial space.390  \n \n386  BK1, ¶ 215.  \n387  TA-JS, ¶ 9.11.  \n388  MB1 -TA, ¶ 7.11.  \n389  BK1, ¶ 214.  \n390  Colliers 2015 Mir Report, page 15.  \nD26/1/149\nConfidential  \n14 July 2022  \nSecond Transferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 150 10.19  Mr Kaczmarek values Hotel Mir as at 31 December 2016 at UAH 259m, based on \nthe value in the Colliers 2015 Mir Report, which according to EY had been verified \nby the NBU in 2015.391 This value is close to my valuation as at 1 July 2016 of \nUAH  252m.   \n10.20  While our valuations are similar, they are based on very different assumptions \nand valuation approaches, and I do  not agree  with Mr Kaczmarek ’s analysis . In \nparticular:  \n(1) Colliers valued Hotel Mir assuming that the hotel portion of the business \nwould be converted into office space, without taking into account the costs \nof such a conversion (which would reduce the v aluation).392 Mr Kaczmarek \nadopted Colliers’ valuation, given its acceptance by the NBU, explaining that \nhe considers that “ the cost of converting and reconfiguring office space is \ncommonly borne by the lessee (i.e., leasehold improvements) ”.393 I do not \nknow the basis for this conclusion but in my experience, significant change \nof use of a property (e.g. from hotel rooms to office space) would likely be a \ncost borne by the owner prior to letting the converted space to tenants. If, \nhowever, the lessees had to  bear the conversion cost of Hotel Mir, they \nwould have reduced the amount that they were willing to pay compared to \nthe amount that they would pay to rent office spaces where no such \nconversion was necessary. All else equal, it must therefore be the case the \nvalue of an already -converted office space will exceed that of a space that is \nyet to be converted. However, Colliers’ valuation is based on the values of \nbuildings already operating as offices;394  \n(2) in contrast, in my valuation I assume that the hot el portion will continue to \noperate as a hotel. The Colliers 2015 Mir Report presents an alternative \nvaluation on this basis. This results in a significantly lower valuation for the \nhotel portion of UAH 41m, compared to Colliers’ valuation of UAH 183m \nassu ming it has been converted (at no cost) into office space;395 and  \n(3) Colliers valued Hotel Mir as at 27 February 2015, almost two years before \nMr Kaczmarek’s valuation date.
