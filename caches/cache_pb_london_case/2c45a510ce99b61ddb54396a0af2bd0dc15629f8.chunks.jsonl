I have \nmore than 25 years’ experience in accounting, first at Baker Tilly (a firm of chartered \naccountants and auditors) and latterly at Lee & Allen (a specialist firm of forensic \naccountants, acquired by Charles River Associates in 2005 where I was Vice President and \nhead of the forensic accounting team). I joined A&M in 2010 where I am now the firm’s \nTechnical Partner (responsible for staff training in accounting); co-lead our international \narbitration practice and lead our contentious valuation team. \n1.1.2 A copy of my curriculum vitae is attached at Appendix 1.1 .  \n1.2 Instructions \n1.2.1 I am instructed in this matter by Enyo Law LLP (“Instructing Solicitors”), acting on behalf of \nthe Second Defendant, Mr Gennadiy Bogolyubov (“D2”), in a claim brought by \nJSC Commercial Bank “PrivatBank” (the “Bank”) against Mr Igor Kolomoisky (“D1”), D2 and \nthe following corporate defendants:  \ni) TeamTrend Limited (“D3”);  \nii) Trade Point Agro Limited (“D4”); \niii) Collyer Limited (“D5”); \niv) Rossyn Investing Corp (“D6”); \nv) Milbert Ventures Inc (“D7”); and \nvi) ZAO UKRTransitService Ltd (“D8”) \nCollectively, “Defendant Suppliers” \n \nD3/1/6\nExpert Report of Luke Steadman \nJSC Commercial Bank PrivatBank -v- (1) Igor Kolomoisky (2) Gennadiy Bogolyubov & Others \n 6 \n 1.2.2 In accordance with paragraphs 14 and 16 of the Order of Justice Mann dated 26 June 2020, \nI am instructed to opine on the loss alleged to have been suffered by the Bank, following \nwhat I consider to be standard accounting principles and practice, but limited to any \nadditional matters that I wish to raise in light of my review of the Report of Jeffrey Davidson \ndated 28 January 2022, served on behalf of D1 (“Davidson 1”).  \n1.2.3 I have been instructed not to consider independently the accuracy and completeness of the \nBank’s causation analysis set out in the Report of Ian Thompson dated 24 November 2021 \n(“Thompson 1”) or of D1’s tracing exercise.

Documents which \nI have obtained are attached as Exhibits to this Report. A list of Exhibits and documents relied \nupon can be found at Appendix 1.2 . Where a contemporaneous document has been \nprovided to me by my Instructing Solicitors, I reference it by the description and the \ndisclosure notation used in these proceedings. \n1.3.2 Data provided by the Bank in relation to transactions in accounts under its control \n(“Transaction Data”) is in both Ukrainian and English. Where I have used information in \nUkrainian, I have relied upon the translation provided by Ukrainian speaking members of my \nteam.  I set out my understanding of the Transaction Data at Appendix 1.3 . \n1.4 Terminology \n1.4.1 I set out below my understanding of certain terminology used in this matter: \ni) Relevant Loans  are amounts totalling USD 3.75 billion relating to 134 loan \nagreements, advanced by the Bank to Borrowers between 1 April 2013 and \n30 September 2014; \nD3/1/7\nExpert Report of Luke Steadman \nJSC Commercial Bank PrivatBank -v- (1) Igor Kolomoisky (2) Gennadiy Bogolyubov & Others \n 7 \n ii) Borrowers  are 47 Ukrainian and 3 Cypriot companies to which the Relevant \nLoans were advanced; \niii) Relevant Drawdowns are 270 individual, drawn-down amounts from the \nRelevant Loans during the period 1 November 2013 to 1 September 2014 \n(“Relevant Drawdown Period”) totalling USD 2.3 billion which, on the Bank’s \ncase, caused USD 1.9 billion in Unreturned Prepayments to the Defendant \nSuppliers; \niv) Unreturned Prepayments are amounts totalling USD 1.9 billion paid to the \nDefendant Suppliers by the Borrowers between 28 May 2014 and \n1 September 2014 pursuant to supply agreements; \nv) Intermediary Loans  are amounts totalling USD 2.48 billion advanced by the Bank \nbetween 26 February 2013 and 9 June 2015 to 64 borrowers (of which, 30 are \nalso Borrowers) which funds were used, in part, to repay the Relevant Loans; \nvi) Transformation  represents the process by which amounts advanced to the New \nBorrowers under the New Loans between October and November 2016 were \nused in part to repay the Relevant Loans and the Intermediary Loans; \nvii) New Borrowers  are 36 Ukrainian companies to which the New Loans were \nadvanced; \nviii) New Loans are loans issued to the New Borrowers as part of the Transformation;  \nix) Asset Transfers  are transfers to the Bank of real estate and other assets applied \nby the Bank in purported part settlement of the Relevant Loans and the \nIntermediary Loans and other loans; and \nx) Relevant Customers  are 4661 customers of the Bank listed in Table 2 of Annex A \nto Section 1B of the Disclosure Review Document as attached to the Order of \nMr Justice Mann, dated 21 October 2020, which I am instructed was agreed in \ncorrespondence between solicitors to D1 and the Bank and includes, but does \n \n1 There are 466 customers listed, however, within this population of Relevant Customers, I have identified that there were thirteen \nduplicate customers. \nD3/1/8\nExpert Report of Luke Steadman \nJSC Commercial Bank PrivatBank -v- (1) Igor Kolomoisky (2) Gennadiy Bogolyubov & Others \n 8 \n not solely comprise, the Borrowers, the borrowers of the Intermediary Loans, \nthe Ne"}

There are also a relatively \nsmall number of transactions and accounts denominated in Euro (“EUR”), Russian Roubles2 \n(“RUB”) and Pound Sterling (“GBP”).  \n1.5.2 For the purposes of this Report, I have presented amounts in both UAH and USD where \napplicable and also presented amounts translated to a USD equivalent. Where I have \ntranslated amounts recorded in the Transaction Data to USD, I have used the daily spot rate \nor an average rate of a defined period. I set out at Appendix 1.4  the exchange rates I have \nused which have been sourced from S&P Capital IQ.      \n1.5.3 During the period 2013 to 2016, the UAH depreciated against the USD, moving from a rate \nof approximately 8 UAH/USD in January 2013 to over 16 UAH/USD in December 2014 before \nreaching a low of over 28 UAH/USD in February 2015. Therefore, over the course of the \nperiod it became more expensive for debt denominated in USD to be repaid by sums in UAH.   \n1.6 Other Matters \n1.6.1 The opinions I have expressed in this Report are necessarily based on the documents and \nexplanations provided to me. Should further information become available after the date of \nthis Report which, on consideration by me, affects the findings or opinions stated in this \nReport, then I will issue an amended or supplemental report to modify my opinions where \nnecessary.

In particular I consider accounting assets and obligations from the perspective of \nan accountant and not with reference to English or Ukrainian Law which I recognise are \nmatters for the Court. The Report has been prepared solely for use in proceedings between \nthe parties to this matter and their advisers. This Report, save as provided in Law, is not \npublic and should not be used, reproduced or circulated for any purpose without my \nconsent. My firm accepts no responsibility to third parties for breaches of this obligation. \n1.6.3 I have been assisted in the preparation of this Report by members of my team working under \nmy supervision.

As such, I have included a brief summary of the matter in the \nfollowing paragraphs in so far as it relates to my instructions. I note that the background \ninformation contained in this Section does not form part of my opinion and serves only to \nprovide context for the remainder of this Report. \n2.1.2 On 18 December 2016, the Bank was declared insolvent by the National Bank of Ukraine \n(“NBU”), and a temporary administrator was appointed by the Deposit Guarantee Fund of \nUkraine, following which it was nationalised3 and restored to solvency (“Nationalisation”).  \n2.1.3 Prior to its Nationalisation, the Bank was substantially owned by D1 and D2. D1 and D2 were \npart of the Bank’s Supervisory Board, of which D2 was Chairman from 2003 to 2015. \nFollowing its Nationalisation, D1 and D2 (and the other members of the Supervisory Board) \nwere dismissed and replaced by a new management team. \n2.2 The Bank’s Case \n2.2.1 The Bank alleges that D1 and D2 procured, and were the ultimate beneficiaries of, the \nmisappropriation of approximately USD 1.9 billion from the Bank (“the Misappropriation”).4 \nD1 and D2 are said to have carried out the Misappropriation by procuring the granting of \nthe Relevant Loans and the Unreturned Prepayments (which are alleged to have been \ncaused by the Relevant Loans). \n2.3 D1’s Case \n2.3.1 D1 pleads that: \ni) Save in respect of two loans totalling in aggregate USD 74 million, the Relevant \nLoans were repaid to the Bank by a combination of repayments from other \naccounts (“Cash Repayments”), the transfer of assets (i.e., the Asset Transfers) \n \n3 Bank’s Re-Re-Re-Amended Particulars of Claim, dated 26 January 2022, paragraph 2 \n4 Bank’s Re-Re-Re-Amended Particulars of Claim, dated 26 January 2022, paragraph 5 \nD3/1/11\nExpert Report of Luke Steadman \nJSC Commercial Bank PrivatBank -v- (1) Igor Kolomoisky (2) Gennadiy Bogolyubov & Others \n 11 \n and the proceeds of the New Loans. Accordingly, the Bank has suffered no loss. \nThis is described in Davidson 1 as the “Loan Repayment Defence”5; and \nii) The proceeds of the Relevant Loans were returned to the Bank in discharge of \nvarious liabilities, with the result that the Bank suffered no loss. This is referred \nto in Davidson 1 as the “Use of Funds Defence”.6  \n2.4 Repayment of Relevant and Intermediary Loans \n2.4.1 Thompson 1 and Davidson 1 appear to agree, following their respective analysis of the \nTransaction Data, that: (i) the Relevant Loans were, save in respect of two loans, recorded \nas repaid; and (ii) the Intermediary Loans, were recorded as fully repaid: \nTable 2.1  Summary of repayment of Relevant and Intermediary Loan principal balances7,8 \nUSD 'm Relevant Loans  Intermediary Loans  \nDrawdowns  3,751.6  2,476.1  \nRepayments:    \nCash Repayments  (2,357.6) (1,699.1) \nAsset Transfer  (650.3) (210.5) \nTransformation  (668.7) (566"}

This can sometimes be referred to as an accounting loss and represents \nthe charge observed in financial statements against profit for a particular reporting period. \nA loss is incurred, in financial reporting terms, in the accounting period in which it is \nrecognised, but there are some circumstances where a provision for future expected losses \nis required. \n3.1.2 I have reviewed the Bank’s annual audited financial statements for the year ending 31 \nDecember 2016 (“2016 Financial Statements”) as well as earlier financial statements, to \nidentify the treatment of loans and assets in those financial statements. \n3.2 The Impairment Recognised by the Bank \n3.2.1 In accounting terms: \ni) an asset is impaired where its value as recorded in an entity’s balance sheet (its \n“carrying amount”) exceeds its recoverable amount.21 The impairment charge \n(an expense charged to profit for the year in which the charge is made) relates \nto the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount; \nand \nii) an expense is a loss in accounting terminology. \n3.2.2 An impairment loss attributable to the matters which are the subject of the claim was \nrecognised by Bank and can be identified for the first time in its 2016 Financial Statements.   \n3.2.3 In those financial statements, the Bank recognised a provision for impairment of loans to \ncorporate entities of UAH 147.8 billion (USD 5.5 billion)22 (“the Impairment”).

Of this, \nUAH 135 billion (USD 4.8 billion) is said to relate to loans to the New Borrowers issued as \n \n20 Exhibit 1 – Extract from the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (Chapter 4 – The Elements of Financial Statements) \n21 Exhibit 2 – Extract from International Accounting Standard (IAS) 36 – Impairment of Assets, Definitions, paragraph 6 \n22 Bank’s annual audited financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2016, page 22 \nD3/1/15\nExpert Report of Luke Steadman \nJSC Commercial Bank PrivatBank -v- (1) Igor Kolomoisky (2) Gennadiy Bogolyubov & Others \n 15 \n part of the Transformation.23 The detail in the 2016 Financial Statements does not allow, and \nthe Bank has not disclosed information that would enable, the Impairment charge to be \nallocated between those New Loans which were used to repay the Relevant Loans and the \nIntermediary Loans balances (i.e., Table 2.1 above) and the New Loans which repaid other \nlending. \n3.2.4 The Bank’s accounting policies note that: “ Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss \nfor the period when incurred as a result of one or more events (“loss events”) that occurred \nafter the initial recognition of the financial asset, and which have an impact on the amount \nor timing of the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets \nthat can be reliably estimated. ”24 \n3.2.5 In accounting terms and taking the financial statements at face value, the “loss event” that \ngave rise to the Impairment and write down of loans has occurred in the financial year ended \n31 December 2016. This is consistent with the Bank’s explanation in the 2016 Financial \nStatements that, “ in October - November 2016, the Bank restructured a part of its loan \nportfolio with a total value of UAH 137,082 million before allowance for impairment as at 31 \nDecember 2016. During the restructuring, the Bank changed loans currency to UAH, lowered \ninterest rates, extended maturity of loans to 2024 and 2025, converted some of loans into \nfinance lease and changed collateral pledged under loans. As at 31 December 2016, the Bank \nrecognised UAH 135,018 million of allowance for impairment under these loans. ”25 \n3.2.6 The loans impaired in this way were in the most part, not overdue.26 \n3.2.7 In summary therefore, the Bank’s 2016 Financial Statements record that: \ni) loans having a carrying value of UAH 137.1 billion were restructured (I \nunderstand this relates to the Transformation); of which \nii) amounts totalling UAH 135.0 billion were recorded as fully impaired; \n \n23 Bank’s annual audited financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2016, page 22 \n24 Bank’s annual audited financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2016, page 9, Note 3 \n25 Bank’s annual audited financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2016, page 22, Note 9 \n26 Of loans impaired of UAH 176.5 billion against which an impairment provision of UAH 169.1 billion was raised, UAH 162 billion were \nrecorded as “not overdue”.

As a matter of accounting principle, a loan which \nhas been repaid cannot be impaired because it is no longer an asset on a bank’s balance \nsheet. In accounting terms, the impairment was recognised by the Bank in respect of New \nLoans which indicates to me that the Bank had recorded the Relevant Loans and \nIntermediary Loans as having been repaid. \n3.3.2 As set out above, I understand that the Bank claims in these proceedings that the \nrepayments of the Relevant Loans and the Intermediary Loans were not valid as a matter of \nUkrainian law and are to be disregarded. This is a legal issue on which I do not express any \nopinion. However, as I have explained above, the Bank’s financial statements were prepared \non the basis that these loans were in fact repaid.  The loss being claimed by the Bank in these \nproceedings is therefore different to the accounting loss which it has recognised in the 2016 \nFinancial Statements.   \n3.4 Conclusion \n3.4.1 I conclude in this Section that the loss recognised by the Bank in its 2016 Financial \nStatements relates to the New Loans and no impairment has been recognised by the Bank \nin relation to the Relevant Loans. As the Bank’s claim is premised upon disregarding the \nrepayment of the Relevant Loans with funds derived from the Intermediary Loans and the \nNew Loans, it is inconsistent with the Bank’s 2016 Financial Statements, where the New \nLoans are treated as assets, albeit then impaired. \n \n \n \n   \nD3/1/17\nExpert Report of Luke Steadman \nJSC Commercial Bank PrivatBank -v- (1) Igor Kolomoisky (2) Gennadiy Bogolyubov & Others \n 17 \n 4 Whether the Relevant Loans caused the Bank loss \n4.1 Introduction \n4.1.1 Even if the repayments of the Relevant Loans and the Intermediary Loans were invalid, I do \nnot consider that it necessarily follows from an accounting perspective that the Bank could \nor should have recognised a loss in respect of those loans specifically. In particular, the \nBank’s case is that the substance of the Relevant Loans were shams and were not intended \nto create commercially enforceable obligations.27 Further, Mr Davidson identifies that 71% \nof the Relevant Drawdowns, by value, were used to make repayments to the Bank of other \namounts including loan repayments and payments of interest.28 \n4.1.2 From an accounting perspective, it would be inconsistent to invalidate the repayment of the \nRelevant Loans by the Intermediary Loans and New Loans but not to invalidate the \nrepayment of other lending by the Relevant Loans. Put another way, the basis that the Bank \nseeks to look through the Intermediary Loans and the New Loans may be equally applicable \nto the Relevant Loans. \n4.1.3 I note in this regard that an NBU Investigation Report, dated 25 April 2019, identified that \nduring the period from January 2007 to December 2016, a “scheme of cyclical re-lending”  \nhad operated at the Bank and that “… to maintain continuity of [the] scheme, issuance of \nnew loans is required…” .29 I do not know whether the NBU is correct in stating that such a \nloan recycling scheme operated at the Bank, since I do not have access to the Bank’s \ntransactional data throughout this entire period. However, in my view as an accountant, any \nloss occurring as a result of such a scheme (for instance the impairment of loans) may arise \nat the beginning of the recycling scheme (i.e., when the first loans are issued and repaid with \nfurther lending from the bank), or at the end of the scheme (i.e. when the loans ceas"}

If the Relevant Loan Drawdowns \nhad resulted in an overall increase in the size of the Bank’s loan portfolio, that could be an \nindication that funds left the Bank which were not repaid as part of any loan recycling \nscheme.  \n4.1.5 I do not have access to transaction data for the entire portfolio of the Bank but have been \nprovided with the transaction data for the Relevant Customers, which includes accounts of \nthe Borrowers, borrowers of the Intermediary Loans, New Borrowers; and entities identified \nby the Bank and D1 as being companies through whose accounts allegedly relevant funds \npassed; as well as those customers whose loan balances were repaid through the \nTransformation. This data allows me to identify whether the Relevant Drawdowns caused \nany increase in the Bank’s lending to the Relevant Customers.  \n4.1.6 In this section I set out an analysis of the Bank’s loan portfolio by reference to the Relevant \nCustomers and assess the impact of the Relevant Drawdowns on the value of the Bank’s \nlending to the Relevant Customers, in respect of both principal and interest amounts. \n4.2 Methodology \n4.2.1 In order to conduct an analysis of the total lending to the Relevant Customers, extracts of \nthe balances of the Relevant Customer loan accounts30 were taken from the \nTransaction Data using the ‘Balance after transaction’ data field and were obtained at the \nfollowing dates: \ni) the day prior to the start of the Relevant Drawdown Period: 31 October 2013; \nii) the day of the end of the Relevant Drawdown Period: 1 September 2014; and \niii) prior to the start of the Transformation: 1 October 2016.  \n4.2.2 The extracted loan balances31 were for loans recorded in UAH, RUB, EUR and USD. \nMovements in the loan balances were converted to USD using the average spot rate over \nthe applicable time period. A schedule of the extracted loan balances for the Relevant \nCustomers is set out at Appendix 4.2.    \n \n30 A list of all Relevant Customers and their respective loan and interest accounts is set out at Appendix 4.1 \n31 The account prefixes for loan and interest accounts is set out at Appendix 1.3 \nD3/1/19\nExpert Report of Luke Steadman \nJSC Commercial Bank PrivatBank -v- (1) Igor Kolomoisky (2) Gennadiy Bogolyubov & Others \n 19 \n 4.2.3 In addition, interest accrued on the Relevant Customer loans was extracted from those \naccounts prefixed 2068 or 2069 (see Appendix 1.3 ). Where amounts were recorded in \ncurrency other than USD, these have been converted using the average spot rate during the \napplicable period.

A schedule of the interest accrued on loans to the Relevant Customers in \nthe Relevant Drawdown Period is set out at Appendix 4.3.    \n4.2.4 Ideally it would have been useful in my analysis to consider the period prior to the start of \nthe Relevant Drawdown Period. However, since the entities to which the Transaction Data \nrelates are themselves defined by the activity in the Relevant Drawdown Period and \nfollowing, it follows that the Transaction Data is incomplete for the pre-Relevant Drawdown \nPeriod. For instance, if in the Relevant Drawdown Period the proceeds of Loan to C are used \nto repay a Loan to B this will be evident in the Transaction Data, whereas if in the pre-\nRelevant Drawdown Period the proceeds of the Loan to B are used to repay a Loan to A this \nwill not be evident because A is not identified in the Relevant Transaction Period, so its \nidentity and transactions are not in the Transaction Data. \n4.3 Relevant Drawdown Period – 1 November 2013 to 1 September 2014 \n4.3.1 The Relevant Loan Drawdowns, which funded the USD 1.9 billion of \nUnreturned Prepayments, totalled USD 2.3 billion and were made during the \nRelevant Drawdown Period: 1 November 2013 to 1 September 2014.32 The Unreturned \nPrepayments made to the Defendant Suppliers were made in this period.  \n4.3.2 I have analysed the change in the principal and interest balances of the Relevant Customers’ \nloans during the Relevant Drawdown Period:   \n \n32 Thompson 1, Appendix 3-3-1 \nD3/1/20\nExpert Report of Luke Steadman \nJSC Commercial Bank PrivatBank -v- (1) Igor Kolomoisky (2) Gennadiy Bogolyubov & Others \n 20 \n Table 4.1  Change in Relevant Customers principal and interest balances during the \nRelevant Drawdown Period33 \n‘m 31-Oct-13 01-Sep-14 Movement  Movement (U SD) \nUAH Loans 39,777.5  48,816.2  9,038.7  871.0  \nUSD Loans 2,881.8  2,702.1  (179.8) (179.8)  \nEUR Loans 2.5  1.8  (0.7) (1.0)  \nTotal Balance       690.3 \n     \nOf which:     \nBorrowers \nOther Relevant Customers  1,127.3  \n(437.0) \n4.3.3 As shown in the table above, during the Relevant Loan Drawdown Period, the principal and \ninterest balances on UAH loans made to the Relevant Customers increased by approximately \nUSD 871 million.  \n4.3.4 Conversely, the principal and interest balances on EUR and USD denominated loans made \nto the Relevant Customers decreased by approximately USD 181 million, resulting in a net \nincrease in amounts owed by the Relevant Customers of USD 690 million. This, in turn, can \nbe accounted for as an increase of USD 1.1 billion due from Borrowers and a reduction of \nUSD 437 million due from other Relevant Customers. \n4.3.5 During the Relevant Drawdown Period, the interest accrued on the Relevant Customers’ \nloans totalled USD 618.3 million.34  \n4.3.6 The table below sets out a comparison of the increase in principal and interest balances of \nthe Relevant Customers to the interest accrued on the same loans during the Relevant \nDrawdown Period: \nTable 4.2  Comparison of interest accrued and the balance of Relevant Customer loans \n  Amount ( USD 'm) \nTotal increase in lending 690.3  \nInterest accrued in period (618.3) \nBalance 72.0  \n4.3.7 As shown in the table above, the total increase in Relevant Customer loans was \nUSD 690 million, of which USD 618 million related to interest.

If, as the NBU concluded, there was a loan \nrecycling scheme in operation at the Bank from 2007, and if the Relevant Loans were part of \nthat scheme, the Bank’s loss (in accounting terms) could have been suffered by the Bank \neither prior to the Relevant Loans being made (i.e., as a result of earlier lending) or as a result \nof the New Loans (as the Bank in fact recognised in its 2016 Financial Statements). \n4.5.2 Further, Mr Davidson’s analysis indicates that 71% of the Relevant Drawdowns by value were \nused to repay other loans, including other Relevant Loans and Intermediary Loans. I do not \nconsider that the Relevant Loans could have caused the Bank loss in an accounting sense \nwhere they were used to repay other Relevant Loans or Intermediary Loans, since the Bank’s \ncase is that those borrowers would not otherwise have repaid those loans.36 Beyond that, it \nis not possible to say, from the information that I have been provided with, that the Relevant \nDrawdowns themselves resulted in a loss. \n  "}

However, I note that the transaction chains identified by Mr Davidson do not \nshow any funds being ultimately paid to the seven companies identified by the Bank41 and, \neven insofar as funds were paid to such companies, it does not necessarily follow that they \nwere misappropriated if they were used to repay other loans owed by those companies to \nthe Bank. \n5.1.4 In this Section, I therefore consider the available information in relation to the alleged \nMisappropriation.  \n5.2 No increase in value of the Bank’s lending to the Relevant Customers \n5.2.1 As shown in Section 4 above, the Relevant Drawdowns did not contribute to an increase in \nthe value of the Bank’s lending to the Relevant Customers, other than in relation to interest \nand a USD 72 million increase in loans owed to the Bank. \n5.2.2 Further, although I am not instructed to reperform or verify work done by Mr Thompson and \nMr Davidson, I note that Mr Davidson has identified transaction chains for 193 of the 270 \nRelevant Drawdowns which result in funds of USD 1.69 billion being returned to the Bank in \nsettlement of other liabilities.42 Therefore, such transactions did not result in an increase in \nthe size of the Bank’s loan portfolio compared with its position prior to the Relevant \nDrawdown Period, or result in funds leaving the Bank. Of these repayments, Mr Davidson \nconcludes that USD 866 million related to the repayment of Relevant Loans and \nUSD 279 million to the repayment of Intermediary Loans.43 \n5.3 Transactions involving other banks \n5.3.1 As noted at Appendix 1.3 , the Transaction Data includes transactions with banks other than \nPrivatBank, which are identified with the prefixes 1500 and 1600 (not excluding those for \n \n41 Davidson 1, Appendix 8 \n42 Davidson 1, paragraph 5.66 (iii) \n43 Davidson 1, paragraph 5.68 \nD3/1/25\nExpert Report of Luke Steadman \nJSC Commercial Bank PrivatBank -v- (1) Igor Kolomoisky (2) Gennadiy Bogolyubov & Others \n 25 \n PrivatBank operations). Using these account prefixes, I have identified transactions between \nthe Borrowers and those borrowers of Intermediary Loans and other banks during the period \n1 November 2013 (the start of the Relevant Drawdown Period) and Nationalisation. A \nschedule of these transactions can be found at Appendix 5.1 .  \n5.3.2 From this analysis, I have identified four Borrowers and two borrowers of Intermediary Loans \nwho collectively transferred a net equivalent of USD 88.2 million to accounts outside of the \nBank.44 None of these amounts were funded from Relevant Loans. According to the \ntransaction narratives, these transfers were used to pay for audit and legal services or to \ntop-up current accounts held by the same entity with ‘PJSC Real Bank’. \n5.3.3 I have identified a single instance where the repayment of a Relevant Loan’s principal \nbalance was funded from external sources: The principal balance on the Relevant Loan, \n4G13472I held by the Borrower Gardera LLC (“Gardera”), was partially repaid through funds \nreceived from the Relevant Customer: Ukrtatnafta, who had received funds from accounts \noutside of the Bank. In total, UAH 17.8 million (USD 0.7 million) was received by Ukrtatnafta \nand ultimately transferred to Gardera and used to repay the principal balance on the \nRelevant Loan, 4G13472I.45   \n5.3.4 With the exception of these transactions, the analysis of the transactions with other banks \ndid not identify any other amounts that were transferred to or received by any of the \nBorrowers or the borrowers of Intermediary Loans, from accounts with other banks during \nthe period from 1 November 2013 to Nationalisation.  \n5.4 Conclusion \n5.4.1 The data available to me indicates that: \ni) the Relevant Drawdowns did not lead to"}
