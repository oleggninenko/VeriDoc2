I prepared a report for the Court on the Adjusted \nRetrospective Market Value of Aircraft on 24 November 2021 (my \" First \nReport \"). For ease of reference, I adopt the technical and defined terms set out \nat pages 4 to 9 of my First Report. \n In my First Report, I provided my expert opinion on the market value of the five \nAircraft1 which are identified in the First Defendant’s Re-Re-Amended Defence, \nas at 22 August 2016. \n On 24 January 2022, the First Defendant served an expert report prepared by \nMr Philip Seymour (\" Seymour 1 \") in which Mr Seymour valued the five Aircraft, \ntogether with an additional four aircraft (the \" Additional Four Aircraft \"), that I \nhad not been instructed to value in my First Report.  \n On 9 March 2022, Mr Seymour and I completed our expert joint statement in \nwhich we identified areas of agreement and disagreement in our respective \nreports (the \" Joint Statement \"). The Joint Statement did not address the \nvaluation of the Additional Four Aircraft. \n I understand from my instructing solicitors that, pursuant to the Order of Mr \nJustice Trower dated 29 March 2022, the Bank has been granted permission to \nadduce expert evidence on valuation of the Additional Four Aircraft.  \n I have been instructed to provide my expert opinion on the true value of three \nof the Additional Four Aircraft (namely, the Additional Airbus, the Additional \nEmbraer 290 and the Additional Embraer 394, as defined below) in this, my \n\"Second Report \".  In respect of the fourth aircraft, the Additional Boeing 767 \n(as defined below), I am instructed that the Bank accepts Mr Seymour’s \nvaluation and, accordingly, I am not instructed to value it in my Second Report. \n I have been assisted in preparing my Second Report by my colleague, Les \nWeal.  Details of Mr Weal’s experience are summarised at paragraph 31 of my \nFirst Report.  All the opinions expressed in my Second Report are my own.  \n \n1   I refer to these five aircraft in my First Report as “ Airbus ”, “Boeing 737 ”, “Boeing 767 533 ”, “Boeing \n767 536 ” and “ Embraer ”.  \nD13/15/3\n \n  4 \nMy instructions \n I have been instructed to provide my expert opinion on the true value of the \nAdditional Airbus, the Additional Embraer 290 and the Additional Embraer 394 \nas at 22nd August 2016, being the date on which it is pleaded that the security \ngranted over the Aircraft was applied in repayment "}
{"start": 3500, "text": " in my Second Report are my own.  \n \n1   I refer to these five aircraft in my First Report as “ Airbus ”, “Boeing 737 ”, “Boeing 767 533 ”, “Boeing \n767 536 ” and “ Embraer ”.  \nD13/15/3\n \n  4 \nMy instructions \n I have been instructed to provide my expert opinion on the true value of the \nAdditional Airbus, the Additional Embraer 290 and the Additional Embraer 394 \nas at 22nd August 2016, being the date on which it is pleaded that the security \ngranted over the Aircraft was applied in repayment of Relevant Loans. As was \nthe case in my First Report, I have been instructed to apply the definition of \nmarket value provided in the 2013 edition of the International Valuation \nStandards (\" IVS 2013 \") for the purposes of my assessment.  \n By contrast, Mr Seymour values these aircraft as at 16 August 2016 and applies \nthe market value standard defined by the International Society of Transport \nAircraft Trading (\" ISTAT \") for the purposes of his assessment. Mr Seymour and \nI agree that these differences in our respective instructions should not have any \neffect on our valuation conclusions.2 \n As I have explained above, I am not instructed to value the Additional Boeing \n767.  \n My full instructions, on the basis of which my Second Report was written, are \nexhibited at Exhibit OR5. \nDocumentation \n The information and documentation on which this Second Report is based are \nreferred to in the specific sections of this report.  In addition, I set out in \nAppendix C  a list of documents that I refer to in this report, and in Appendix D , \na list of further documents that have been provided to me, beyond those \nidentified in Appendix B(ii) of my First Report and those identified in Appendix \n3 to Seymour 1. \n Some of the documents provided to me were in the Russian and Ukrainian \nlanguages. I explain how I rely on Russian and Ukrainian language documents \nat paragraph 26 of my First Report.   \nAssumptions \n I have not seen or inspected the aircraft that are the subject of my Second \nReport or their technical records for the purposes of preparing my Second \nReport.  Instead, I have relied on the information from the CAPA Fleets \ndatabase as well as contemporaneous valuation reports, various physical and \n \n2  Joint Statement, paragraphs 5.1 and 5.2. \nD13/15/4\n \n  5 \nrecord inspection reports, and other contemporaneous documents as set out in \nAppendix C .  \n For the purposes of this Second Report, I repeat the assumptions set out at \nparagraph 28 of my First Report. The restrictions set out in paragraphs 29 and \n30 of my First Report also apply equally to my Second Report. \nPART 2 \nExecutive summary \n In Seymour 1, Mr Seymour valued the Additional Four Aircraft.  The Additional \nFour Aircraft are: \na. Airbus A321-200, MSN 2682 (\" Additional Airbus \"); \nb. Boeing 767-300ER, MSN 25280 (\" Additional Boeing 767 \"); \nc. Embraer ERJ-145EP, MSN 145-290 (\" Additional Embraer 290 \"); and \nd. Embraer ERJ-145EP, MSN 145-394 (\" Additional Embraer 394 \"). \n As I explained above, I am not instructed to value the Additional Boeing 767 in \nthis report. \n The basic details of the Additional Airbus, the Additional Embraer 290 and the \nAdditional Embraer 394 are summarised in Tables A1-A6 at Appendix A . \n In Table 1 below, I summarise my valuations of the Additional Airbus, Additional \nEmbraer 290 and the Additional Embraer 394 (and the value that I am instructed \nthe Bank accepts in respect of the Additional Boeing 767) and compare those \nvaluations to the valuations attributed to the Additional Four Aircraft in the \nDilorsano Purchase Agreements, and as valued by Mr Seymour. \n  \nD13/15/5\n \n  6 \nTable 1: Comparison of my valuations, Mr Seymour's valuations and the values in the \nDilorsano Purchase Agreements   \n \n \n3  Joint Statement, paragraph 3.2. \n4  Additional Airbus Purchase Agreement (PB0363479_00001). \n5  Additional Boeing 767 Purchase Agreement (PB0363476_00001). \n6  As I have explained above, I am instructed that the Bank accepts Mr Seymour’s va"}

I also use the same two-stage \nmethodology and valuation process as described in my First Report10. \n  The Additional Airbus, the Additional Embraer 290 and the Additional Embraer \n394 are of the same type as, and a similar vintage to, certain of the Aircraft \nvalued  in my  First  Report.   I  can,  therefore,  rely  on  the Stage  1 analysis  in \nAppendix I to my First Report to produce the Retrospective Market Values (i.e. \nthe Stage 1 values) for these aircraft. In Appendix B, I briefly set out the data \npoints used in reaching  my Stage 1 values. Full details of those data points, \nand how they contribute to my Stage 1 values, are set out in Appendix I to my \nFirst Report.  \nPART 4 \nMy valuations \n In this section, I set out each stage of my valuation methodology to produce a \nvalue for the Additional Airbus, the Additional Embraer 290 and the Additional \nEmbraer 394 as at 22nd August 2016. \nThe Additional Airbus \nStage 1: Arriving at the Retrospective Market Value \n My Retrospective Market Value for a 2006-built Airbus A321-200 with a basic \nspecification and in “half-life” maintenance condition on 22nd August 2016 is \n$20.40m.  I set out the data points used in Appendix B  of this report  and \nprovide further detail on those data points and my valuation methodology in \nAppendix I to my First Report.  \n I summarise the basic specification for an Airbus A321-200 in Table 2 below.  \n \n9  First Report, paragraphs 44-47. \n10  First Report, paragraphs 48-76. \nD13/15/7\n \n  8 \nTable 2: Basic specification of Airbus A321-200 \n Aircraft basic specification  \nAircraft type  Airbus A321-200 \nEngine type  IAE V2533-A5 SelectOne \nEngine OEM  International Aero Engines \nMaximum Take-Off Weight \n(MTOW)  89,000 kg \nOther specifications  No Sharklets11 \n \nStage 2A: Arriving at the Half-Life Retrospective Market Value \nActual configuration of the Additional Airbus \n The Additional Airbus was equipped with two IAE V2533-A5 engines12.  These \nengines are an older version of the basic specification V2533-A5 SelectOne \nengines.  The SelectOne engines have improved performance characteristics \ncompared to the older generation.  This accordingly requires a negative \nadjustment to the value of the aircraft.  \n In order to make this adjustment, I add the cost of the parts required in order to \nretrofit the V2533-A5 SelectOne engines to give the performance \nimprovement.13  I calculate this to be $0.70m  and make a negative adjustment \nin this amount.  \n The Additional Airbus’ MTOW was 93,000 kg compared to the standard MTOW \nof 89,000 kg.

A higher MTOW allows an aircraft to carry a higher payload or to \ntravel further, increasing its versatility and revenue generation.  Based on my \nexperience and prevailing market sentiment, I make a positive adjustment \nwhich I calculate to be $0.30m . \n \n11  Even though Sharklets became popular after their introduction as an option for newly built aircraft in \nDecember 2012, when my “basic specifications” were set there were few aircraft equipped with them. \n12  Veritas Airbus Report, page 9 (PB0110158_00001 and PB0110158_00001_English). \n13  International Aero Engines > Products > V2500-A5 SelectOne (Exhibit OR1, page 6). \nhttps://links.prattwhitney.com/i-a-e/productsv2500.html   \nD13/15/8\n \n  9 \n The Additional Airbus had no sharklets installed, which is also in line with the \nbasic specification.  Accordingly, no adjustment is required.  \nAdjustments based on the actual configuration of the Airbus \n The adjustments to my Retrospective Market Value reflecting the Additional \nAirbus’ actual configuration are summarised in the following Table 3.  \nTable 3: Additional Airbus specification adjustments  \n Aircraft specification adjustments \nAircraft type  Airbus A321-200 \nAircraft serial number  2682 \nSpecification items Basic \nspecification Actual Adjustment \nRetrospective Market \nValue    $20.40m \nEngines  V2533-A5 \nSelectOne V2533-A5 ($0.70m) \nMTOW  89,000 kg 93,000 kg $0.30m \nSharklets  None None - \nTotal adjustment   ($0.40m) \nHalf-Life \nRetrospective Market \nValue   $20.00m \n \nStage 2B: Arriving at the Adjusted Retrospective Market Value \n In this section I set out the adjustments I have made in order to adjust the Half-\nLife Retrospective Market Value by reference to the actual maintenance status \nof the Additional Airbus’ major modules to arrive at the “Adjusted Retrospective \nMarket Value”.  \n This section focuses in particular on the maintenance status of the (i) airframe, \n(ii) engines, (iii) engine LLPs, (iv) landing gear and (v) APU of the aircraft.  \nD13/15/9\n \n  10 \nMaintenance status \n Table 4 below sets out the maintenance status of the aircraft as of August 2016 \nas sourced from the contemporaneous report and lease agreement referenced \nindividually. \nTable 4: Additional Airbus maintenance status \n Aircraft maintenance status \nAircraft type  Airbus A321-200 \nAircraft serial number  2682 \nMaintenance status \nitem Parameter14 Effective date \nTotal aircraft hours  31,132 On or before 30th \nJune 201615  \nTotal aircraft cycles  10,286 On or before 30th \nJune 2016  \nDate of the last 12-\nyear check  Not yet \nundertaken - \nMonths since new  123 22nd August 2016 \nDate of the last 6-year \ncheck  28th \nNovember \n2011 - \nMonths since 6-year \ncheck  57 22nd August 2016 \nDate of the last C-\nCheck  11th January \n2011 - \n \n14 As recorded in the Veritas Airbus Report, pages 9 and 16, (PB0110158_00001 and \nPB0110158_00001_English), save where otherwise specified. \n15  The Veritas Airbus Report does not state the date of the information received from the operator (page 2, \ndescription of Appendix 1).

It \nwas a mature aircraft with its major modules at various points in their respective \nmaintenance schedules.   \n Therefore, I assessed each major module (i.e. airframe, engines, engine LLPs, \nlanding gear and APU) with regards to its maintenance status compared to the \nrespective “half-life” point.  \nAirframe \n12-Year Check adjustment \n The Airbus A321 airframe has a schedule of major maintenance inspections \noccurring every 12 years (or 144 months) known as a 12-Year Check.  Based \n \n19  Veritas Airbus Report, page 9 (PB0110158_00001 and PB0110158_00001_English). \nD13/15/12\n \n  13 \non the confidential information available to me, the typical cost of a 12-Year \nCheck is $1.6m.  As at my valuation date, the Additional Airbus had not yet \nreached its first 12-Year Check.  Its time since new was 123 months.   \n Accordingly, I make the following negative adjustments in respect of the 12-\nYear Check from the Half-Life Retrospective Market Value of the airframe:  \na. 144 months / 2 – 123 months = - 51 months. \nb. The monthly adjustment for the 12-year check is $1,600,000 / 144 \nmonths = $11,111.11 pcm. \nc.  Total 12-Year Check adjustment is $11,111.11 x - 51 months = \n($566,667). \n6-Year Check adjustment \n The Airbus A321 airframe also has a schedule of major maintenance \ninspections occurring every 6 years (or 72 months), known as a 6-Year Check.  \nThe 12-Year Check discussed above is a more comprehensive maintenance \ninspection which includes, but is not limited to, the tasks of the 6-Year Check.  \n In line with the accepted appraisal practice, a more comprehensive check (12-\nYear Check) supersedes the less comprehensive check (6-Year Check) until \nthe time that the maintenance event reaches the “half-life” point of the less \ncomprehensive check.  \n The last major airframe check performed on the Airbus was the 6-Year Check \ncompleted on 28th November 2011.20 \n At the"}

This \nis below the “half-life” point of the 6-Year Check (72 months / 2 = 36 months).   \n Therefore, the 12-Year Check supersedes the 6-Year Check and I assume the \nlatter to be at “half-life” in line with the accepted appraisal practice. I, therefore, \ndo not make any adjustment in respect of the 6-Year Check.  \n \n20  Veritas Airbus Report, page 9 (PB0110158_00001 and PB0110158_00001_English). \nD13/15/13\n \n  14 \nC-Check adjustment \n The A321 airframe also has a schedule of less comprehensive checks called \nC-Checks which take place every 7,500 hours or 24 months, whichever occurs \nfirst.21   \n The Veritas Airbus Report states the date of the last C-Check to be 11th January \n201122.  This is some 68 months prior to the date of valuation and would have \nseen the calendar limit of 24 months expire.  As the aircraft was operational, \nhowever, the C-Check must have taken place.  \n Accordingly, I assume the C-Check to be at “half-life” in line with the accepted \nappraisal practice and I do not make any adjustment in respect of the C-Check.   \nEngines and Engine LLPs \nNumber 1 engine \n At the point of valuation, the Number 1 title engine, the V2533-A5, SN V12189:  \na. had 5,661 hours and 2,366 cycles since its last shop visit;23   \nb. had been operating at 2.4:1 hour to cycle ratio as calculated by dividing \n5,661 hours by 2,366 cycles; and \nc. had its main operating base in Kyiv, Ukraine, where Windrose Airlines was \nbased, which I assume to be a benign operating environment. \n I do not have any information about whether the operator used engine derate.  \nI assume the average engine derate for the V2533-powered A321-200 aircraft \nbased on the confidential information available to me.   \n Based on the above engine’s operating data and confidential information \navailable to me, I estimate the TBO to be in the order of 13,900 hours.  With \n5,661 hours operated since the last overhaul, the time remaining before the \nnext overhaul should be 8,239 hours.  Accordingly, I make a positive adjustment \nin respect of the Number 1 engine overhaul.  \n \n21  MRO Management, “Extension Lead”, March 2017 (Exhibit OR1, page 10) \n22  Veritas Airbus Report, page 9 (PB0110158_00001 and PB0110158_00001_English) \n23  Ibid. \nD13/15/14\n \n  15 \n The Number 1 engine LLP limiter (the LLP with the least life remaining) has \n9,872 cycles remaining.24  At the 2.4:1 hour to cycle ratio, this should equate to \napproximately 23,962 hours, which exceeds the remaining time to overhaul \nbased on estimated TBO.  \n Having compared the time to overhaul mandated by the two reasons for \nscheduled engine maintenance, the performance degradation time remaining \nof 8,239 hours25 and the LLP replacement of 23,962 hours26, I select the \nshortest time (i.e. the performance degradation time, with a TBO of 13,900 \nhours), in line with accepted industry practice.   \n Based on the confidential information available to me, I assess the cost of the \nengine overhaul was $3.16m.  I make the following adjustment in respect of the \nNumber 1 engine overhaul:  \na. 13,900 hours / 2 – 5,661 hours = 1,289 hours. \nb. The hourly adjustment for the engine overhaul is $3,160,000 / 13,900 \nhours = $227.34 per hour. \nc.

The \nremaining cycles of the LLPs of the title Number 1 engine, SN V12189, range \nbetween 9,872 and 16,502 cycles.27  The majority of parts have their lives \nremaining just below the “half-life” point of 10,000 cycles.  A small number of \nparts have their lives remaining significantly above the “half-life” point of 10,000 \ncycles.  I have assessed the remaining cycles of each LLP of the title Number \n1 engine against its limit and the confidential information available to me.   \n Accordingly, I make a positive adjustment in respect of the engine LLPs for the \nNumber 1 engine of $117,087 . \n \n24  Veritas Airbus Report, page 16 (PB0110158_00001 and PB0110158_00001_English). \n25  Paragraph 47. \n26  Paragraph 48. \n27  Veritas Airbus Report, page 16 (PB0110158_00001 and PB0110158_00001_English). \nD13/15/15\n \n  16 \nNumber 2 engine \n At the point of valuation, the Number 2 engine, the V2533-A5, SN V12191:  \na. had 0 hours and 0 cycles since its last shop visit28 and 29,898 hours and \n9,943 cycles since new;29   \nb. had been operating at 3.0:1 hour to cycle ratio as calculated by dividing \n29,898 hours by 9,943 cycles; and \nc. had its main operating base in Kyiv, Ukraine, which I assume to be a \nbenign operating environment. \n I do not have any information about whether the operator used engine derate.  \nI assume the average engine derate for the V2533-powered A321-200 aircraft \nas provided in the confidential data available to me.   \n Based on the above engine’s operating data and the confidential information \navailable to me, I estimate the TBO to be in the order of 15,050 hours.  With 0 \nhours operated since the last overhaul, the engine has its full TBO of 15,050 \nhours remaining.  Accordingly, I make a positive adjustment in respect of the \nNumber 2 engine overhaul.  \n The engine LLP limiter (the LLP with the least life remaining) has 7,293 cycles \nremaining.30  At the 3.0:1 hour to cycle ratio this should equate to approximately \n21,879 hours, which exceeds the remaining time to overhaul based on \nestimated TBO.  \n Having compared the time to overhaul mandated by the two reasons for \nscheduled engine maintenance, the performance degradation time remaining \nof 15,050 hours31 and the LLP replacement of 21,879 hours32, I select the \nshortest time (i.e. the performance degradation time, with a TBO of 15,050 \nhours), in line with accepted industry practice.  \n \n28  The Veritas Airbus Report at page 9, states that “ as of the evaluation date the engine shop visit was \nalmost over, that is why in the calculations the evaluator refers to it as having been completed .”  This is \nin line with the accepted appraisal practice. \n29  Veritas Airbus Report, page 9 (PB0110158_00001 and PB0110158_00001_English). \n30  Veritas Airbus Report, page 16 (PB0110158_00001 and PB0110158_00001_English). \n31  Paragraph 55. \n32  Paragraph 56. \nD13/15/16\n \n  17 \n Based on the confidential information available to me, I assess the cost of the \nengine overhaul was $3.16m.

I have seen nothing in Mr \nSeymour’s report or elsewhere that would cause me to question my Stage 1 \nvaluation. \n In arriving at his Stage 2B value, Mr Seymour used adjustments that I consider \nto be incorrect for (i) the 6 and 12-Year Checks to the Airframe and (ii) the \nlanding gear overhaul. \n6 and 12-Year Checks \n In Seymour 1, Mr Seymour adjusts for the 6-Year and 12-Year Check \nseparately.  Accordingly, his calculations are based on the assumption that 15 \nmonths after the point of valuation, the Additional Airbus was to undergo a 6-\nYear Check at the cost of $0.8m and 6 months after that it was to undergo a \n12-Year Check at an additional cost of $1.2m36.  I do not agree.  An airline will \nnot conduct two major checks within 6 months of each other and incur a \ncombined cost of $2m ($0.8m plus $1.2m, using Mr Seymour’s figures).  \nInstead, it will only perform a 12-Year Check, which incorporates all the \nrequirements of the 6-Year Check and more, at a cost of $1.2m.  \n For this reason, Mr Seymour's valuation of the Additional Airbus should have \nbeen adjusted for the 12-Year Check which was due in 21 months, but should \nnot have been adjusted in respect of the 6-Year Check, in line with accepted \nappraisal practice.  \nLanding Gear Overhaul  \n When adjusting for the landing gear, Mr Seymour states that Additional Airbus' \nlanding gear had an overhaul interval of 120 months37, or 10 years.  Mr \nSeymour then states that, at the point of valuation, 21 months remained to the \noverhaul38.  He makes a negative adjustment of ($106,000). \n I have not identified any information pertaining to the status of the Additional \nAirbus’ landing gear overhaul in the documents provided to me and Mr \nSeymour.  Accordingly, as I explained above, Mr Seymour should have \nassumed it to be in “half-life” condition and made no adjustment in respect of it, \nas per the accepted appraisal practice. \n \n36  Seymour 1, paragraph 11.6. \n37  Seymour 1, paragraph 11.6. \n38  Seymour 1, paragraph 11.6. \nD13/15/20\n \n  21 \n Table 8 below shows my corrections to Mr Seymour’s adjustments for the \nAdditional Airbus. \nTable 8: Corrections to Mr Seymour’s maintenance adjustments to the Additional \nAirbus \nMaintenance \nevent My adjustment Mr Seymour’s \nadjustment39  Mr Seymour’s \nadjustment as \ncorrected \nAirframe 6-\nYear Check $0 ($233,000) $0 \nAirframe 12-\nYear Check ($566,667) ($425,000) ($425,000)40 \nLanding Gear \nOverhaul $0 ($106,000) $0 \nTotal No 1 and \nNo 2 Engine \nOverhaul and \nLLP $2,165,701 $2,149,000 $2,149,00041 \nTotal $1,599,035 $1,385,000 $1,724,000 \n \n My corrections bring Mr Seymour’s maintenance adjustments within a \nreasonable difference range. \n Using the corrected adjustments, Mr Seymour’s Additional Airbus \nRetrospective Adjusted Market Value would be $27.57m42. \n Table 9 below compares my Adjusted Retrospective Market Value for the \nAdditional Airbus against Mr Seymour's valuation (i) as originally set out in \nSeymour 1; and (ii) as amended by the maintenance adjustment corrections set \nout in Table 8 above. \n \n39  Seymour 1, paragraph 11.6. \n40  I consider the difference between my adjustment and Mr Seymour’s adjustments to be within normal \nvariance. \n41  I consider the difference between my adjustment and Mr Seymour’s adjustmen"}

The “EP” variant \nhas the same MTOW as the “LR” variant and has little operational difference.  \nTherefore, I make no adjustment to the Retrospective Market Value.  \n The Additional Embraer 290 was equipped with two Rolls-Royce AE3007A1 \nengines45, in line with the basic specification.  The subject aircraft’s MTOW was \n20,990 kg which is in line with the basic specification.46  \n Accordingly, I make no adjustments to the Retrospective Market Value of \n$1.70m in respect of the Additional Embraer 290’s actual configuration.  \nStage 2B: Arriving at the Adjusted Retrospective Market Value \n In this section I set out the adjustments I have made in order to adjust the Half-\nLife Retrospective Market Value by reference to the actual maintenance status \nof the Additional Embraer 290’s major modules to arrive at the Adjusted \nRetrospective Market Value.  \n This section focuses in particular on the maintenance status of the (i) airframe, \n(ii) engines, (iii) engine LLPs, (iv) landing gear and (v) APU of the aircraft. \nMaintenance status \n Table 11 below sets out the maintenance status of the aircraft as at August \n2016 as sourced from the contemporaneous and later documents referenced \nindividually. \n \n45  Veritas Embraer Report, page 10 (PB0110159_00001).  \n46  2019 Additional Embraer 290 Inspection Report, page 6 (PB0370507_00001). \nD13/15/23\n \n  24 \nTable 11:  Additional Embraer 290 maintenance status \n Aircraft maintenance status \nAircraft type  Embraer ERJ-145EP \nAircraft serial number  145290 \nMaintenance status item Parameter47 Effective date \nTotal aircraft hours  26,653  On or before 30th June \n201648 \nTotal aircraft cycles  22,194  On or before 30th June \n2016  \nDate of the last C-Check  5th July 2012  - \nHours since last C-Check  4,501  On or before 30th June \n2016  \nNo 1 title engine serial \nnumber  31152949 - \nNo 1 engine total hours  Unknown  - \nNo 1 engine total cycles  Unknown  - \nNo 1 engine hours since \nshop visit  Unknown  - \nNo 1 engine cycles since \nshop visit  Unknown  - \nNo 1 engine hour : cycle \nratio Unknown  - \nNo 1 engine cycles to LLP \nlimiter  Unknown  - \nNo 1 engine LLP limiter  Unknown "}

At the point of valuation, according to the information recorded in the \nVeritas Embraer Report, the subject airframe had accumulated 4,501 hours \nsince its last C-Check.55  The accumulated time of 4,501 is above the 2,500-\nhour “half-life” point for the C-Check.  Accordingly, I make a negative \nadjustment in respect of it. \n The typical cost of a C-Check was $150,000.  I make the following adjustment \nin respect of the airframe C-Check. \na. 5,000 hours / 2 – 4,501 hours = - 2,001 hours. \nb.

In line with accepted industry \npractice, I assume it to have been in a “half-life” condition and make no \nadjustment in relation to it. \nTotal Maintenance Adjustments \n The individual maintenance adjustments are added up to arrive at the total \nmaintenance adjustment as summarised in the following Table 19.  \n \n100  2019 Additional Embraer 394 Inspection Report, page 14 (PB0370506_00001). \nD13/15/41\n \n  42 \nTable 19: Additional Embraer 394 maintenance adjustments \n Aircraft maintenance adjustments \nAircraft type  Embraer ERJ-145EP \nAircraft serial \nnumber  145394 \nMaintenance event \n(units) Accumulated \nsince event Interval Adjustment \nAirframe C-Check \n(hours)  3,446  5,000  ($28,380)  \nNo 1 engine \noverhaul (hours)  Unknown  - - \nNo 1 engine LLPs \n(cycles)  Unknown  - - \nNo 2 engine \noverhaul (hours)  5,904  7,700  ($312,105)  \nNo 2 engine LLPs \n(cycles)  Various  20,000-35,000  $70,153  \nNose landing gear \noverhaul (months)  121343  144 ($43,750)  \nLeft Main landing \ngear overhaul \n(months)  70 144 $1,042  \nRight Main landing \ngear overhaul \n(months)  121 144 ($25,521)  \nAPU overhaul  Unknown  - - \nTotal adjustment   ($338,561)  \n \n The Adjusted Retrospective Market Value is arrived at by applying this \nadjustment to the Half-Life Retrospective Market Value.

Accordingly, I am unable to comment on or critique them.  \nBy contrast, I provide further detail on the data points I rely on to arrive at my \nStage 1 value in Appendix B  of this report and Appendix I of my First Report.  \nI have seen nothing in Mr Seymour’s report or elsewhere that would cause me \nto question my Stage 1 valuation. \n \n101  See footnote 34.  \n102  Seymour 1, paragraph 17.4. \nD13/15/43\n \n  44 \n In arriving at his Stage 2B value, Mr Seymour (i) considered the installed \nengines ESNs 310150 and 311216103 instead of the title engines, ESNs 311549 \nand 311704104 and (ii) did not adjust for the landing gear overhaul. I consider \nthese factors render Mr Seymour’s maintenance adjustment for the Additional \nEmbraer 394 incorrect. \nNumber 1 and Number 2 Engines \n In Seymour 1, Mr Seymour considers the installed engines, ESNs 310150 and \n311216105 for his valuation, relying on the information from the Veritas Embraer \nReport106.  However, the Additional Embraer 394’s title engines were in fact \nESNs 311549 and 311704107, being the engines with which it was delivered to \nthe operator. \n Mr Seymour and I agree that that the use of ‘title’ (when known) rather than \n‘installed’ engines for the purpose of the valuation is an accepted industry \npractice.108  Accordingly, instead of considering the installed engines (ESNs \n310150 and 311216109) Mr Seymour should have considered the title engines, \n(ESNs 311549 and 311704).   \nNumber 1 Engine overhaul and LLPs \n As no information about the maintenance status of one of these title engines \n(ESN 311549) is available, Mr Seymour should have assumed it to be in a “half-\nlife” maintenance condition with regards to its overhaul and LLPs, with no \nresulting adjustment to the value of the Additional Embraer 394. \nNumber 2 Engine overhaul  \n The other title engine, ESN 311704, was installed on another aircraft, Embraer \nERJ-145, MSN 145094110.  As information on the maintenance condition of this \n \n103  Seymour 1, paragraph 17.5. \n104  Table A6, Appendix A. \n105  Seymour 1, 17.5. \n106  Veritas Embraer Report, page 11 (PB0110159_00001). \n107  Aircraft Delivery Acceptance Form, page 14 (PB0363223_00001).  \n108  Joint Statement, paragraph 7.11. \n109  The error in Mr Seymour’s approach is shown by the fact that, in Seymour 1, he has valued the same \nengine (ESN 331216) twice: once as the title engine to the Embraer (Seymour 1, paragraph 15.9) and \nonce as the title engine to the Additional Embraer 394 (Seymour 1, paragraph 17.5).  Plainly, the same \nengine cannot be attributed to the two aircraft simultaneously.  \n110  Veritas Embraer Report, page 11 (PB0110159_00001). \nD13/15/44\n \n  45 \ntitle engine is available in the Veritas Embraer Report, an adjustment can be \nmade in respect of it.  \n In addition to considering the installed engines rather than the title engines, in \nSeymour 1, Mr Seymour adjusts for the Additional Embraer 394’s engine \noverhaul using the overhaul interval of 8,500 cycles111.  However, according to \nthe IBA EVB published information referenced in Appendix 28 to Seymour 1, \nthe engine overhaul interval is 8,450 hours at the hour-to-cycle ratio of 1.3:1112, \nwhich translates into an overhaul interval of 6,500 cycles113.

This is the cyclical overhaul interval I use \nto correct Mr Seymour’s maintenance adjustments.  \n The title engine ESN 311704 had operated 5,773 cycles since its last \noverhaul114.  Using the overhaul interval of 6,500 cycles and Mr Seymour’s \noverhaul cost of $1.2m115, Mr Seymour’s adjustment for the title engine’s, ESN \n311704, engine overhaul should be ($465,785)116. \nNumber 2 Engine LLPs \n Seymour 1 quotes the total cost of the AE3007 engine’s LLPs to be $1.8m at \nthe point of valuation117.  The total cost of the AE3007 engine’s LLPs I use for \nmy adjustment is $1.83m.  Given these costs are very close, I assume that Mr \nSeymour’s adjustment for the title engine’s, ESN 311704, engine LLPs would \nbe in line with my adjustment of $70,153118. \nLanding gear overhaul \n The 2019 Additional Embraer 394 Inspection Report provides the date of \ncompletion of (i) the Nose landing gear overhaul as 12th June 2005119; (ii) the \n \n111  Seymour 1, paragraph 17.5. \n112  Seymour 1, Appendix 28. \n113  8,450 hours / 1.3 hour-to-cycle ratio. \n114  Table 26. \n115  Seymour 1, paragraph 17.5. \n116  $1,200,000 / 6,500 cycles * (6,500 cycles / 2 – 5,773 cycles). \n117  Seymour 1, paragraph 17.5. \n118  Paragraphs 130 to 131. \n119  2019 Additional Embraer 394 Inspection Report, page 14 (PB0370506_00001). \nD13/15/45\n \n  46 \nLeft Main landing gear overhaul as 3rd November 2010120;  and (iii) the Right \nMain landing gear overhaul as 15th August 2006121. \n In Seymour 1, Mr Seymour states that the landing gear overhaul interval is 120 \nmonths122.  The correct interval is 144 months123. \n Utilising the information available in 2019 Additional Embraer 394 Inspection \nReport, Mr Seymour’s adjustments for the Additional Embraer 394’s landing \ngear overhaul would have been:  \na.
