This is the Re-Re-Re-Amended  Defence of the Second Defendant (‘ Mr Bogolyubov ’).  \nIt is served in response to the Re-Re-Re-Re-Amended Particulars of Claim dated 15 \nAugust 2018  24 April 2020  14 September 2020  26 January 2022  18 October 2022  (the \n‘Particulars of Claim ’). \n2. For convenience, Mr Bogolyubov adopts the headings and some of the defined terms \nused in the Particulars of Claim, with minor modifications, without thereby making any \nadmissions.  Unless otherwise stated, references below to paragraph numbers are to \nparagraphs in the Particulars of Claim.   \n3. Save for those documents expressly admitted to be authentic in this Defence, none of \nthe documents referred to in the Particulars of Claim is admitted to be authentic and  the \nBank is required to prove their authenticity.  \n4. Mr Bogolyubov disputes that the English Court has  jurisdiction over him in respect of \nthe Claimant’s claims , alternatively that it should exercise any such jurisdiction.  This \nDefence is served without pre judice to that position and to his intended appeal to the \nSupreme Court . \nA1/18/1\nA1/18/1\n2  4. Save as expressly set out  below , and save that Mr Bogolyubov does not address \nallegations concerning  the position of the  other Defendants, Mr Bogolyubov joins issue  \nwith the Claimant on the Particulars of Claim.  \n5. As to the claim of “misappropriation” against Mr Bogolyubov , in summary : \n(1) Mr Bogolyubov did not procure the misappropriation of US$1.9 billion from \nthe Claimant (the  ‘Bank ’). \n(2) The Bank  has not provided any particulars of how and when Mr Bogolyubov is \nalleged to have procured the alleged misappropriation.  Instead, its case appears \nto be based entirely on various inferences which are unjustified .  In particular:  \n(a) As expl ained at paragraphs  20 to 27 below, Mr Bogolyubov did not \ncontrol the Bank  in any relevant respect . Although he was a major \nshareholder and, for a period of time, Chairman and a member of the \nBank’s Supervisory Board, he did not have any executive role wit hin the \nBank and was not responsible for, nor did he manag e or exercise , day-\nto-day control over its activities , including its lending decisions.  \n(b) To the best of his knowledge  and recollection , and based on \ninvestigations conducted in the time available, Mr Bogolyubov had no \nownership interest  in 3876 of the 4 76 Ukrainian Borrowers  at the time \nat which the Relevant Loans were allegedly made . Appendi x A to this \nRe-Re-Re-Amended  Defence  sets out any interest that he had in 143 of \nthose borrowers at the material  times. In most instances, he had only a \nsmall (and often a  de minimis ) percentage ownership  interest in any such \nborrower .  If and insofar as further investigation reveals that Mr  \nBogolyubov had any different or additional interest in any of the \nBorrowers at the material times , he will seek to amend his Re-Re-Re-\nAmended  Defence accordingly.  Moreover, and as explained further \nbelow, he did not  control any of the Borrowers  and, if they did enter into \nthe various agreements  alleged by the Bank, it was not with Mr \nBogolyubov’s knowledge or on his instructions.  \n(c) Mr Bogolyubov did not own or control the Third to Eighth Defendants.  \nThe matter"}

If the  Third to Eighth Defendants did enter into \nthe various agreements alleged by the Bank, it was not with Mr \nBogolyubov’s knowledge or on his instructions.  \n(3) The Bank ’s has not provided any particulars of  case as to  how and when Mr \nBogolyubov is alleged to have been the ultimate beneficiary of the alleged \nmisappropriation  is vague  and is not properly supported by the matters sought \nA1/18/2\nA1/18/2\n3  to be relied upon .  Mr Bogolyubov denies that he knowingly benefited from any \nmisappropriation of the Bank’s funds.   \n(4) In fact , the Relevant Loans were  (save for two loans, as explained further below)  \nrepaid  and were recognised as such by the Bank in its transactional data an d \nfinancial statements . evidence produced in connection with the Defendants’ \njurisdictional challenges  Further : (i) the expert forensic accounting evidence \nserved by the Claimant and the First Defendant  indicates that all, or at least a \nlarge proportion of , the monies allegedly drawn down by the Ukrainian \nBorrowers , Relevant Drawdowns  were repaid to the Bank, either to rep ay the \nRelevant Loans themselves or to repay other borrowing ; (ii) none of the sums \ndrawndown by way of the Relevant Drawdowns were transferred  by the \nBorrowers  to accounts outside of the Bank . Accordingly, there was no \nmisappropriation and  such draw -downs caused no loss to the Bank.  \n(5) Further and in any event, the Bank’s claims against Mr Bogolyubov are time -\nbarred pursuant to Art 257 of the Civil Code  of Ukraine  (‘UCC ’) because  all \nthe Relevant Loans are alleged to have been made in or before  Augu st 2014 and \nthe limitation period expired three years later, by 31 August 2017 at the latest.  \n(6) In the premises , it is denied that Mr Bogolyubov has any liability to the Bank \nand its claim s against him  should be dismissed.  \n6. Before  the Bank’s nationalisation i n December 2016 , Mr Bogolyubov  had certain  rights \nto access the Bank’s documents and records  in his capacities as Chairman  and as a \nmember of the Supervisory Board  and as a shareholder  of the Bank .  Since December \n2016 , Mr Bogolyubov has had no access to any of the Bank’s documents or records.  \nHis Re-Re-Re-Amended  Defence has been prepared on the basis of the information \nnow available to him, including the evidence submitted by the Bank and the other \nDefendants in conn ection with their jurisdictional challenges, and to the best of his \nrecollection . \n7. Mr Bogolyubov awaits disclosure of relevant documents from the Bank and other \nDefendants . He reserves his right to seek to amend his Re-Amended  Defence in due \ncourse in light of the foregoing.  \n(a) Mr Bogolyubov  \n8. Mr Bogolyubov was born in Ukraine (then part of the Soviet Union) and has joint \nUkrainian , United Kingdom, Cypriot  and Israeli citizenship.  He moved to London in \n2009 and did not move back to live in Ukraine until 2019 . Accordingly, throughout the \nperiod of the alleged misappropriation , he did not live in Ukraine, and nor was it the \nfocus of his business activities.   \nA1/18/3\nA1/18/3\n4  9.

Mr Bogolyubov has a degree in industrial and civil engineering and has a range of \nbusiness interes ts, primarily in the extractive industries and real estate .  He is also a \nphilanthropist and has been a large donor to charitable organisations, particularly within \nthe Jewish community in the Dn ipropetrovsk region of Ukraine, as well as to Jewish \ncharities, schools and orphanages around the world.  \n(b) Mr Kolomoisky  \n10. Mr Bogolyubov and the First Defendant (‘ Mr Kolomoisky ’) met in the early 1990s.  \nSince then, they have worked together on many projects and investments .  They each \nalso have business int erests of their own.  As set out below, they co -founded the Bank  \nwith three other  individual s in 1992.   \n(c) PrivatBank  \n11. Paragraph 1 is admitted.   The Bank was co -founded in March 1992 by Mr Bogolyubov, \nMr Kolomoisky , Alexey Martynov, Leonid Miloslavksy and Sergey Tigipko.  \n12. As to paragraph 2:  \n(1) In the course of 2015  and 2016 , a politically motivated campaign was waged \nagainst Mr Kolomoisky  in Ukraine , instigated by the then President, Petro \nPoroshenko, which was designed to create the conditions for the nationalisation \nof the Bank.  \n(2) It is admitted that on 18 December 2016, the National Bank of Ukraine (‘ NBU ’) \ndeclared that the Bank was insolvent.   It is denied that the Bank was insolvent \nat that time (or any prior date)  and Mr Bogolyubov relies in that regard on the \nfollowing :  \n(a) On 14 July 2017, Mr Kolomoisky commenced judicial review \nproceeding s in Ukraine to declare unlawful and cancel various de cisions \nof the NBU and other authorities which resulted in the Bank’s \nnationalisation.  \n(b) On 18 April 2019, the District Administrative Court of Kyiv granted Mr \nKolomoisky’s claims in full having determined that there had been no \nlawful grounds on which the Bank could properly have been declared to \nbe insolvent, that the procedure by which the Bank was nationalised was \nitself unlawful and that the defendants  to those proceedings (including \nthe NBU)  had unlawfully interfered with Mr Kolomoisky’s ownership \nof the Bank.  This decision is currently subject to appeal. The \nproceedings are currently stayed upon the application of the NBU until \nthe Constitutional Court of Ukraine rules on the constitutionality of the \nA1/18/4\nA1/18/4\n5  Law of Ukraine on “Amendments to Certain Legislative  Acts of Ukraine \non Improving the Mechanisms of Banking Regulation” dated 13 May \n2020 No. 590 -IX, the so -called “Anti -Kolomoisky Law”.  \n(c) Mr Kolomoisky (together with Triantal Investments Ltd) has also \nbrought proceedings before the Commercial Court of Kyiv a gainst the \nNBU, the Bank, the DGF, the NSSMC and the Ministry of Finance \n(among others), seeking the invalidation of the agreement for the \npurchase and sale of the Bank’s shares dated 21 December 2016 (“the \nSPA”).  \n(d) Mr Kolomoisky’s claim relating to the SPA  was stayed on 16 October \n2019 pending the conclusion of the judicial review proceedings but \nfollowing the lifting of the stay, proceedings resumed in the Commercial \nCourt of Kyiv in December 2021.  \n(3) Further, o n 6 November 2017, Mr Bogolyubov filed a Notice of Claim under \nthe UK -Ukraine Bilateral investment treaty (‘BIT’) regarding the expropriation \nof his shareholdings  in the Bank by the Ukrainian State .  He claims in particular  \nthat: \n(a) in nationalising the Bank without the payment of any compensation, the \nState of Ukraine : \n(i) acted in breach of its obligations under Article 2 of the BIT to \nprovide fair and equitable treatment to him and his investments; \nand \n(ii) expropriated his shareholding interests in the Bank, as well as \npersonal funds held by him in accounts at t he Bank and other \nassets, for an illegitimate purpose and on a discriminato"}

Save that no admission is made as to Mr Kolomoisky’s  precise  shareholding in the Bank \nat any time, paragraph 3  is admitted .  It is admitted that at all material times prior to the \nBank’s nationalisation, Mr Kolomoisky had a substantial direct and indirect \nshareholding in the Bank of between approximately 40% and 50%.  \nA1/18/5\nA1/18/5\n6  14.

Accordingly, the alleged ‘Misappropriation’ is also denied.  \n(4) As to the alleg ation that Mr Bogolyubov was the ultimate beneficiary of some \nor all of the alleged misappropriation of the Bank’s funds : \n(a) The allegation  is embarrassing in its lack of particulars.  Mr Bogolyubov \nreserves his right to plead further in the event that further and proper \nparticulars are provided . \n(b) If which is denied, any funds were misappropriated from the Bank, Mr \nBogolyubov did not give any direct or indirect instructions or any form \nof approval  for any such transfers  and Iit is denied that Mr Bogolyubo v \nwas the knowing beneficiary of any funds allegedly misappropriated \nfrom the Bank  as alleged in paragraph 26 of the Bank’s 5 May Response .  \n(bb) Save for the loan to Tamersa LLC in the principal amount of USD 19. 2 \nmillion  (the Tamersa Loan ) and the loan to Prominmet in the amount \nprincipal amount of USD 55.7 million  (the Prominmet Loan ), the \nRelevant Loans were repaid.  \n(c) As set out further below , the evidence produced in connection with the \nDefendants’ jurisdictional challenges  the expert fore nsic accounting \nevidence served by the Claimant and the First Defendant  indicates that \nall, or  at least a large proportion of , the monies actually drawn down by \nthe Ukrainian Borrowers  Relevant Drawdowns , which the Bank \nA1/18/6\nA1/18/6\n7  contends caused the Unreturned Prepayments,  were repaid to the Bank, \neith"}

Mr Bogolyubov was concerned about the potential impact upon the Bank of Mr \nKolomoisky holding such a high-profile political position  at a time when Russia was at \nwar with Ukraine .  In June 2014, Mr Bogolyubov decided that he wished  to divest \nhimself of his shareholding in the Bank .  It became apparent that Mr Bogolyubov would \nnot be able to sell his share s in the Bank at that stage but , until he could do so, he \ndecided  to reduce his limited role on the Supervisory Board .

As to paragraph 14:  \n(1) In the circumstances set out above, it is denied that Mr Bogolyubov controlled \nthe Bank or controlled all significant decisions made by the Bank (including all \nsignificant corporate lending decisions) at all materi al times.  \n(2) In particular, i t is denied that  Mr Bogolyubov was able to exercise control over \nall significant decisions made by the Bank  (including the decisions set out  at \nparagraph 2 of the Bank’s 30 July 2021 Response)  and he did not do so in \npractice : \n(a) As set out above, the management of the Bank, and responsibility for \nmaking all significant decisions, was entrusted to the Bank’s \nManagement Board, both as a matter of Ukrainian law and in practice . \n(b) It is admitted that Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Kolomoisky each had a major \nshareholding in the Bank at all relevant times.

If it is \nintended to allege that Mr Bogolyubov ever gave any direct or indirect \ninstructions to any of the Bank’s executives and employees  to act in a way \nwhich was contrary to the Bank’s internal policies or the Bank’s interests, that \nallegation is embarrassing in its lack of particulars.  Pending provision of proper \ndetails of that allegation, it is in any event denied.  \n(6) Save as is consistent with the foregoing,  and so far as matters concern Mr \nBogolyubov,  paragraph 14 is denied.  \n(e) Mr Bogolyubov’s alleged destruction of documents  \n28.

The reference to Ukrainian law in the third sentence is \nembarrassing for want of particularity. Without prejudice to this, it is denied \nthat Mr Bogolyubov intended to cause harm to the Bank or to viol ate Ukrainian \npublic policy and it is denied that any such intention by Mr Bogolyubov (which \nis denied) is attributable to the Borrowers and the Defendant Suppliers.  \n(D) UKRAINIAN LAW  \n(a) Alleged liability in tort  \n36. As to paragraph 33 : \nA1/18/18\nA1/18/18\n19  (1) Mr Bogolyubov will rely on the terms of Art 1166 UCC for their full meaning \nand effect. Art 1166 provides in material parts:  \n“Article 1166: General Grounds of Responsibility for Property Harm \nCaused  \n1. Property harm inflicted to personal intangible rights of a natural \nor legal person by unlawful decisions, acts or omissions, as well as \ndamage inflicted to property of a natural or legal person shall be \ncompensated in full by a person who has inflicted damage.  \n2. A person who has inflicted damage shall be re leased from \nliability if they prove that the damage has been inflicted without their \nfault.  \n… \n4. Damage inflicted by unlawful actions is compensated in cases \nprovided for this Code and other law .”  \n(2) Save as is consistent with the foregoing, paragraph 33 is  denied.  \n37. Further, Mr Bogolyubov avers:  \n(1) Art 1166 UCC is not a free -standing provision, but depends upon proof of a \nbreach of a specific provision of Ukrainian law. In order for any decision, action \nor omission to be unlawful for the purposes of Art 1166 UCC, it must amount \nto a breach of a separate duty under Ukrainian law.  \n(2) The Bank’s allegations of “Misappropriation” would amount to allegations of \ncriminal liabilit y pursuant to Art 190 ( fraud ) and/or Art 191 ( misappropriation ) \nof the Criminal Code of the Ukraine ( ‘UCrC ’). As a substantive matter of \nUkrainian law, unless and until a criminal court has established the existence of \nsuch an unlawful act , no liability arises for such allegations under Art 1166 \nUCC.  Accordingly, it is averred that Mr Bogolyubov is not liable in respect of \nthe allegations of “Misappropriation ” in the absence of any criminal finding .  \n(3) So far as the Bank alleges and/or seeks to allege any si ngle unlawful “scheme” \nand/or conspiracy to defraud and/or coordinated action with unity of intent to \nharm, such matters require a finding "}

As to paragraph 34 :  \n(1) The first sentence is admitted as a matter of theory and in appropriate \ncircumstances . However, in the circumstances of these proceedings, o n the \nA1/18/19\nA1/18/19\n20  Bank’s case, the only transfer of the Bank’s funds wa s to Borrowers by way of \nthe Relevant Drawdowns, as to which the Bank has a contractual claim against \nthe Borrowers, but no claim in tort against them under Ukrainian law. Any such \ntransfer caused no harm to the Bank for the reasons set out below.  As to a ny \nfurther transfer from the Borrowers to the Relevant Suppliers, such transfer did \nnot involve the transfer of the Bank’s funds as a matter of Ukrainian law. Save \nas is consistent with the foregoing, the first sentence is otherwise denied.  \n(2) The second sentence is admitted save that t he Bank must establish a sufficient \ncausal link between each particular Relevant Loan and the harm and/or loss \nalleged. Any allegation of a general overall “scheme” and/or misappropriation \ndoes not suffice  to establis h civil liability.  \n(3) The third sentence is admitted as a matter of theory and in appropriate \ncircumstances . \n39. As to paragraph 35, as noted in paragraph 37 above, Art 1166(1) does not give rise to \ncivil liability  absent the establishment of a decision, action o r omission which is \nunlawful under a separate  and specific provision of Ukrainian law . As to the alleged \nprovisions on which the Bank relies for the purposes of Art 1166(1), Mr Bogolyubov \nwill rely on the terms of those provisions for their full meaning an d effect. In particular:  \n(1) Art 3 .1 UCC provides that the “ fundamental principles of civil legislation ” \ninclude:  \n“(2)  impermissibility of deprivation of the right of ownership except as \nprovided by the Constitution of Ukraine and law .”  \nArt 3.1(2) is a statement of general principle relating to civil legislation and does \nnot itself impose any specific duty on  individuals as a matter of Ukrainian law.  \nBreach of Art 3(1)(2) UCC does not suffice to establish liability under Art \n1166(1).   \n(2) Art 13 concerns “ Limits of exercising civil r ights ”. Art 13(2) and Art 13(3) UCC \nprovide:  \n“2. When exercising their rights, a person shall be obliged to refrain \nfrom actions that could violate other persons’ rights, damage \nenvironment or cultural legacy.   \n \n3. A person’s actions aimed at harming another person or otherwise \nabusing their right are prohibited .” \nBreach es of Art 13(2) and 13(3) UCC do not suffice to establish the ‘unlawful’ \nelement for the purposes of liability under Art 1166(1) UCC.  \nA1/18/20\nA1/18/20\n21  (3) Art 92 concerns “ Legal Capacity of a legal entity ”. Art 92(3) UCC provides:  \n“3.  A body or a person who according to the constitutional \ndocuments or the law represents a legal entity is obliged to act \nreasonably and in goo d faith in the interest of a legal entity, and not to \nexceed its powers.  \nRestrictions on powers to represent a legal entity do not have legal effect \nin relations with third parties unless the legal entity proves that the third \nparty was aware of or , in all  the circumstances, could not have been \nunaware of such restrictions. ” \nArt 92(3) UCC  concerns actions made by a person in his capacity as a \nrepresentative of a legal entity in respect of its dealings with third parties  "}

There is no allegation that Mr Bogolyubov acted as a \nrepresentative of the Bank in its transactions with third parties  or that  the \nSupervisory Board considered or approved the Relevant Loans . Accordingly, \nthe relevance of Art 92(3) UCC is denied.  \n(4) Art 63(1) JSC Law provides:  \n“1.  The officers of a company’s bodies shall act in the interests of the \ncompany, follow the requirements  of the law, provisions of the charter \nand other documents of the company. ” \nThe second sentence of paragraph 35(d) is admitted.  \nIf and insofar as provisions of the JSC Law overlap with  contradict  provisions \nof the Law on Banks, then the latter , as the lex specialis for the purposes of \nUkrainian law,  are the only applicable provisions in the circumstances of the \npresent claim . In the circumstances, Art 63(1) JSC Law is inapplicable and its \nrelevance is denied. No allegation in respect of Art 51 is advanced and Mr \nBogolyubov does not plead back to it.  \n(5) Art 42(10) Law on Banks only entered into force  from 10 January 2015. No \nliability attaches to Mr Bogolyub ov pursuant to Art 42(10) for any conduct \ncommitted before 10 January 2015. Accordingly, in the circumstances of this \ncase, Art 42(1 0) Law on Banks cannot apply to and/or create any necessary \nunlawful act for the purposes of Art 1166 UCC.   \n(6) Art 43 Law on B anks provides:   \n“Article 43. Duties regarding the protection of the bank’s interests  \nWhen performing their obligations in accordance with the requirements \nof this Law, the executives of a bank are obligated to act for the benefit \nA1/18/21\nA1/18/21\n22  of the bank and its clien ts and are obligated to place the interests of the \nbank above their own  \nIn particular, officers of the bank must:  \n1) discharge their official duties responsibly;  \n2) make decisions within the powers conferred on them;  \n3) not use their official position for personal interests;  \n4) upon termination of their duties, ensure storage and return of \nproperty and documents. ” \nAny alleged b reach es of Art 43 Law on Banks  by Mr Bogolyubov are wholly \nunparticularised .  So far as relevant , the scope and content of any oblig ation on \nMr Bogolyubov pursuant to Art 43 Law on Banks are informed by the scope \nand content of his duties as a member of the Supervisory Board  and any s uch \nobligations applied to Mr Bogolyubov  only when he was discharging his duties \nin that capacity , and not at other times . For the avoidance of doubt, and pending \nthe provision of any particulars of alleged breached, it is denied that Mr \nBogolyubov breached these provisions in any respect.   \n(7) As to paragraph s 35(g)  and 35(h) :  \n(a) The Supervisory Board did not  participate in the day -to-day \nmanagement of the Bank.  Members of the Supervisory Board were not \nobliged to monitor every individual loan extended to borrowers. In \nrespect of Mr Bogolyubov’s rol e as Chairman of the Supervisory Board,  \nparagraph  25 above is repeated.  \n(b) Further , Mr Bogolyubov will rely on the terms of the Bank ’s Lending \nManual and the fact  that a decision to extend a loan to a client was made \nby the credit committee (of which Mr Bogolyubov was not a member).  \nIf the credit committee did not seek the approval of the Supervisory \nBoard for a particular loan, Mr Bogolyubov’s position on the \nSupervisory Board did not oblige him either to monitor any ind"}

Mr Bogolyubov will \nrely on the terms of the “Provisions of the Supervisory Board [of the \nBank]” and the Bank’s charter  for their full meaning and effect.   \n(d) Further, the Bank itself pleads at paragraph 52(2) of the Particulars of \nClaim  that the Relevant Loans were not in fact authorised by the Bank’s \nSupervisory Board.  Any failure on the part of the credit committee to \nA1/18/22\nA1/18/22\n23  obtain authorisation from the Supervisory Board before permitting the \nRelevant Loans to be made would  not thereby make the m void. \n(e) As to the second and third sentences, Mr Bogolyubov will rely on the \nterms of Art 52 Law on Banks for their full meaning and effect. For the \navoidance of doubt, any transactions to which Art 52 applied would be \nvoidable , not void.   \n(f) Paragraph 35(h) is admitted.  \nSave as is consistent with the foregoing, paragraph 35 is otherwise not admitted .  \n40. As to paragraph 36, Art 614 UCC (“ Fault as Grounds of Responsibility for Violation of \nObligation ”) provides that:  \n“1. A person who has violated an obligation shall bear responsibility \nwhen his fault (intent or negligence) is present unless established \notherwise by the contract or by a law.  \n \nA person shall not be at fault, if he proves that all measures within his \ncontrol were taken for the proper ful filment of the obligation.  \n \n2. A person who has violate d an obligation shall prove the absence \nof his fault… ” \nMr Bogolyubov will rely on the terms of Art 614 UCC for its full meaning and effect.  \nWhere a claim under Article 1166 relies upon breaches of dut ies owed under Article 43 \nof the Law on Banks the applicable standard for determining fault is that of the \nreasonable person.  It is averred that the Art 614 UCC applies in respect of contractual \nliability, but not tortious liability. Save as is consistent with the foregoing, paragraph \n36 is denied.   \n41. As to paragraph 37:  \n(1) The first sentence is admitted  as a broad summary of BVI (and English) law .  \n(2) The second sentence is denied. Under Ukrainian law, there is no (common law) \nconcept of attribution of knowledge of natural persons to legal entities.  \nUkrainian law treats a legal person as having the knowledge of those authorised \nto act in the name of the legal person.  The alleged “principle of common sense” \nis not understood, and in any event denied.  \n42. As to paragr aph 38:  \nA1/18/23\nA1/18/23\n24  (1) The first sentence is admitted save that it is denied that an order under Art 22(4) \nUCC is available in the circumstances of this case because the claim  advanced  \nis one for monetary compensation.  \n(2) The second sentence is  admitted.

There is no power under Ukrainian \nlaw for a Ukrainian Court  to award compound interest in respect of the claims \nalleged against Mr Bogolyubov. The provisions of the Civil Code on which the \nBank relies are not relevant to any interest in respect of the cla ims alleged \nagainst Mr Bogolyubov . Article 22 concerns the right to compensation for \ndamage to property; Article 1192 entitles a victim of property damage to elect \nbetween remedies. Neither provision provides for an award of simple or \ncompound interest.  \n43. As to paragraph 39, Art 1190(1) UCC provides that:  \n “1. Persons whose joint actions or omissions have inflicted harm shall \nbe jointly and severally liable to the injured party .” \nIf particular harm was directly caused by the acts or omissions of one person, n o other \nperson can be held jointly liable for that harm pursuant to Art 1190(1).

Accordingly, a claimant cannot \nadvance a claim in tort against a defendant in circumstances where the claimant has a \nclaim in relation to a  contract (including a claim for restitution under Article 21 6 of the \nCivil Code)  against the defendant.   \n45.  Further, it is averred that t he UCC provides the following in respect of limitation \nperiods under Ukrainian law:  \n(1) Art 257 UCC provides the “ General limitation period ”: \n “1. General limitation period shall be e stablished for three years .” \n(2) Art 261 UCC provides for the “ Commencement of limitation period ”: \nA1/18/24\nA1/18/24\n25   “1.

Mr Bogolyubov does not plead to the allegations concerning liability in unjust \nenrichment in paragraphs 42  to 46 in circumstances in which no claim in unjust \nenrichment is made against him.  \n (d) Void contracts  \n49. As to paragraph 47:  \n(1) Art 215(2) UCC provides:  \n“2. A transaction is invalid if its invalidity is established by law (void \ntransaction). In this case, such transaction is not required to be held \ninvalid by a court. In cases prescribed by this Code, a court may declare \na void transaction valid .” \n(2) Art 236(1) UCC provides:  \n“1.

A mock transaction is a transaction entered into by the parties to \nconceal another transaction that they have actually made .  \n2.  If it is established that a transaction has been entered into by the \nparties to conceal another transaction that they have actually made, the \nrelations of the parties shall be regulated by the rules applicable to the \ntransaction that the parties have actually made. ” \nInsofar as the Particulars of Claim refer to “sham” in the  context of Art 235 UCC, the \nreference should be to a “mock transaction”. Save as is consistent with the foregoing, \nparagraph 49 is otherwise denied.  \n (E) THE BANK’S CLAIMS  \n(a) Claim in tort against Messrs Kolomoisky and Bogolyubov  \n52. As to paragraph 50:  \n(1) It is denied that Mr Bogolyubov had control over the Bank, the Borrowers or \nthe Defendant Suppliers and it is denied that he procured the misappropriation \nof US$1,911,877,385 from the Bank.  \nA1/18/26\nA1/18/26\n27  (2) The allegation that Mr Bogolyubov procured the misappropriation of \nUS$1,911,877,385 from the Bank is embarrassing in its lack of particulars and \nMr Bogolyubov will respond further if and when proper details of that allegation \nare provided.  \n53. Further or alternatively, as a member of the Supervisory Board, Mr Bogolyubov \nperformed his duties and/or undertook his work on the Super visory Board pursuant to \na contract with the Bank. Accordingly, in those circumstances and in the light of the \nmatters set out in paragraph 44 above, the Bank does not have a claim in to rt against \nhim for the matters alleged. The Bank alleges no breach of contract.  \n53A.  The Bank has or had contractual claims against the Borrowers to recover the sums \nallegedly misappropriated from the Relevant Drawdowns.  As a result, it is not open to \nthe Bank to bring claims in tort against third parties, including Mr Bogolyubov.  \n54. Further and in any event, any and all claims in tort against Mr Bogolyubov are time -\nbarred pursuant to Art 257 UCC  (see paragraph  45 above) .  Without prejudice to the \ngenerality of the fo regoing : \n(1) The Bank authorised the Relevant Loans, and accordingly the Bank knew and/or \ncould have known about the alleged violation of any rights at the time the \nRelevant Loans were made.  \n(2) All of the Relevant Loans are alleged to have been made in or before August \n2014 and, accordingly, the limitation period expired, at the latest, 3 years \nthereafter in or before August 2017.   \n(3) The Bank commenced these proceedings  only in December 2017 and it s claims  \nare, accordingly, time barred .  \n(4) Further and in any event, t he claims brought by the Bank in relation to the \nalleged misappropriation of Relevant Drawdowns under loans to the Cypriot \nBorrowers and the Prominmet Loan are new causes of action and were out of \ntime when they were first advanced by way of Protective Claim Form on 14 \nJuly 2"}

As to paragraph 51 , it is denied that any actions, decisions and/or omissions of Mr \nBogolyubov fell within the statutory provisions on which the Bank relies such as to be \nunlawful for the purposes of Art 1166 UCC. The allegations in paragraphs 51(a) -(e) are \nunparticularised and Mr Bogolyubov reserves the right to plead further if and when they \nare properly particularised. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing:  \n(1) Art 3 .1(2) UCC is an interpretative guide to  the UCC and breach of it does not \nsuffice to establish liability under Art 1166(1) . Paragraph  39(1) above is \nrepeated.  \nA1/18/27\nA1/18/27\n28  (2) Breach of Art s 13(2) and 13(3) UCC do not suffice to establish liability under \nArt 1166(1). Paragraph  39(2) above is repeated. Further and/in any event, Art \n13(2) and Art 13(3) apply only to actions , but not to omissions.  \n(3) As to paragraph 51(c):  \n(a) Art 92(3) UCC is irrelev ant. Paragraph  39(3) above is repeated.  \n(b) The provisions of Art 6 3(1) JSC Law are inapplicable in circumstances \nwhere the Law on Banks is the lex specialis . Paragraph  39(4)  above is \nrepeated.   \n(c) The relevant provisions of Art 42 Law on Banks did not apply at the \nmaterial times.  Paragraph  39(5) above is repeated.  \n(4) As to paragraph 51(d),  insofar as it relates to the allegation s in paragraph s 35(g)  \nand 35(h) , para graph  39(7) above is repeated. So far as Mr Bogolyubov was \naware, there was no transaction wi th any “related party” which required \napproval by the Supervisory Board. In any event, Art 42 Law on Banks did not \napply at the material times.  \n(5) As to paragraph 51(e), paragraph  39(6) is repeated.  \n56. As to paragraph 52:  \n(1) For the reasons aforesaid, i t is denied that Mr Bogolyubov exercised control \nover the Bank, the Borrowers or the Defendant Suppliers and it is denied that \nhe procured the misappropriation of US$1,911,877,385 from the Bank.   \n(2) The allegation that Mr Bogolyubov procured the misappropria tion of \nUS$1,911,877,385 from the Bank is embarrassing in its lack of particulars and \nMr Bogolyubov will respond further if and when proper details of that allegation \nare provided.  \n(3) As set out above, the alleged Misappropriation is denied and it is therefor e \ndenied that it was carried out or subsequently hidden in the manner set out in \nsub-paragraphs 52(1)(i) to (viii).  \n(4) As to the particular matters alleged  in sub -paragraphs 52(1)(i) to (viii) , they \nrepeat and summarise allegations to which Mr Bogol yubov has already \nprovided pleaded responses in the paragraphs above . and  \n(5) As to paragraph 52(2) , to the best of Mr Bogolyubov’s knowledge and \nrecollection,  authorisation for the Relevant Loans was not sought from the \nBank’s Supervisory Board .  \nA1/18/28\nA1/18/28\n29  57. Further, if and insofar as the Bank’s claim depends upon findings that the Relevant \nLoans were voidable and are to be avoided, such a determination cannot be made as a \nmatter of Ukrainian law without the counterparty to each Relevant Loan (i.e. the \nBorrower) also being pa rty to the proceedings.  Any claim that the Bank might have \nagainst the Borrower for any such determination and/or declaration that the Relevant \nLoan is invalid  is, however, time -barred pursuant to Art 257 UCC . \n58.

Further  or alternatively,  if contrary to the foregoing, any of the above matters \nconstitutes unlawful decision, actions and/or omissions within the meaning of Art \n1166(1) UCC, Mr Bogolyubov will rely on Art 1166(2). Any harm was not caused by \nhis fault. In circumstances where inter alia  it was not th e function of the Supervisory \nBoard to monitor transactions and the Bank was audited by PWC, he was not at fault \nwithin the terms of Art 614 UCC  (as alleged)  or at all .  \n59. As to paragraph 53:  \n(1) The alleged Misappropriation is denied and it is therefore denied that such \nMisappropriation caused the Bank any loss or damage.  \n(2) It is in any event denied that Mr Bogolyubov is liable to compensate the Bank \nfor the entirety of any loss and damage caused by the alleged Misappropriation  \nor any misappropriation of the Bank’ s funds.  In particular, it is denied that Mr \nBogolyubov is liable to compensate the Bank pursuant to Articles 22, 1166, \n1190 and 1192 UCC , as alleged or at all.  \n(3) Mr Bogolyubov pleads further to the loss and damage claimed to have been \nsuffered by the Bank i n paragraph  67 below.  \n (b) Claim in tort against the Defendant Suppliers  \n60. Mr Bogolyubov does not plead to paragraph 54 because the paragraph concerns the \nclaim against the Defendant Suppliers.  \n61.

Any and all claims under JSC Law and Law on Banks against Mr Bogolyubov are time -\nbarred pursuant to Art 257 UCC.  Paragraph  54 above is repeated.  \n63. As to paragraph 56:  \nA1/18/29\nA1/18/29\n30  (1) If and i nsofar as Mr Bogolyubov owed any obligations pursuant to Art 63 JSC \nLaw, it is d enied that any liability attaches to Mr Bogolyubov pursuant to Art \n63 JSC Law. Paragraph  39(4) above is repeated.  \n(2) As a member of the Supervisory Board, Mr Bogolyubov was not obliged to \nmonitor individual loans.   \n(3) The second sentence is, accordingly, denied.  \n64. As to paragraph 57:  \n(1) Art 42(10) Law on Banks only entered into force  from 10 January 2015. No \nliability attaches  to Mr Bogolyubov pursuant to Art 42(10) for any conduct \ncommitted before 10 January 2015. Accordingly, in the circumstances of this \ncase, Art 42(10) Law on Banks cannot apply to and/or create any necessary \nunlawful act for the purposes of Art 1166 UCC.   \n(2) Accordingly, any alleged liability under Art 42(11) UCC does not arise.  \n(3) As to Art 43 , para graph  39(6) above is repeated.  None of the matters relied upon \nin paragraph 52 relate to alleged acts or omissions of Mr Bogolyubov in the \nperformance of his duties as a member of the Supervisory Board.  \n(4) Save as is consistent with the foregoing, paragraph 57 is otherwise denied.  \n(d) Claim in unjust enrichment against the Defendant Suppliers  \n65.

In that context , the NBU \nA1/18/30\nA1/18/30\n31  implemented various measures in respect of the Bank including “stress tests”, \nand in February 2016 caused the Bank to enter into a restructuring programme \nin respect of its assets and loan portfolio (the ‘ Restructuring ’). In October \n2016, the NBU caused the Bank to implement a transformation plan (the \n‘Transformation’ ) in respect of certain loans. Mr Bogolyubov was made aware \nin general terms of the Restructuring and Transformation and took steps to co -\noperate with the NBU as appropriate.   Subject to the foregoing, Mr Bogolyubov \nhas no knowledge of any repayments of the alleged Relevant Loans and makes \nno admission as to the existence of the alleged “ Intermediary  Recycling  Loans”.   \n(4) It appears to be the Bank’s own case, however, that a large number of the sums \nlent under  Save for the Tamersa and Prominmet Loans,  the alleged Relevant \nLoans were actually repaid  and were recognised b y the Bank as having been \nrepaid in its transaction al data and financial statements . It is averred that, insofar \nas any subsequent loans repaid an earlier loan pursuant to Art 1049(3) UCC, \nthen the repayment was valid and/or effective such as to discharge any liability \nunder the earlier loan  and it is denied that  any repayments stand to be ignored , \nwhether  as a matter of Ukrainian law or at all . The Bank is put to strict proof \nthat any of the alleged Relevant Loans and/or Intermediary Loans were not \nrepaid.   \n(5) Mr Bogolyubov makes no admission as to whether any such subsequent loans  \n(including the New Loans)  were “shams” (i.e. “mock transactions”) within the \nmeaning of Art 235 UCC and/or transactions contrary to public policy within \nthe meaning of Art 228 UCC  and/or whether the New Loans were related party \nlending on non -market terms within the meaning of Article 52 of the Law on \nBanks and/or unauthorised significant transactions within the meaning of \nArticle 70 of the JSC Law  and the Bank is put to strict proof  of such allegations.  \nIt is denied that Mr Bogolyubov owned or controlled the New Borrowers.  \n(6) Further, a ccording to the forensic accounting  evidence  served by the Claimant \nand the First Defendant  and analysis produced on behalf of Mr Kolomoisky , \nupon which Mr Bogolyubov relies, all, or  at least a large proportion of , the \nmonies actually drawn down by the Ukrainian Borrowers  Relevant Drawdowns  \nwere repaid to the Bank, either to repay the Relevant Loans themselves or to \nrepay other borrowing.    \n(7) In the circumstances, it is denied that the alleged Misappropriation  and/or the \nmaking of the Relevant Loans  caused any loss to the Bank.  \n(8) Paragraph 62 is otherwise not admitted.  \n68.
