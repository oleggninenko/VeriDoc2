I am an international businessman with several decades of experience in a variety of industries, \nprimarily mining, metals, finance and real estate.  \n2. I make this statement from my own direct knowledge.  Where information stated is not within \nmy direct knowledge, I believe it to be true and identify the source of the knowledge and belief. \nMy mother tongue is Russian, but I have a fair command of the English language and I have \nprepared this statement in English with the assistance of my solicitors. I may need the assistance \nB2/11/1\n \n2 \n of a Russian interpreter  during my  oral evidence , but my inten tion is to give my evidence  in \nEnglish.   \n3. Where I refer t o documents in this witness statement, I refer to them by the Bates number given \nto them in the parties’ disclosure.  A list of the documents I have referred to or have been \nreferred to for the purpose of providing the evidence set out in my witness statem ent is \nattached at Annex A.  \n4. The Claimant (the “Bank ”) alleges tha t I, along with Igor Kolomoisky, controlled all significant \ndecisions made by the Bank and that we procured, and were the ultimate beneficiaries of , \n1,911,877,385  US dollars  of the Bank’s fu nds that it says were misappropriated between April \n2013 and Septe mber 2014.  The se allegations are false.  \n4.1. I was a shareholder and Supervisory Board member of the Bank.  I was not an executive.  \nI lived in London from 2009 onwards and was focusing on my ow n independent \ninvestments.  The Bank was run by its management, wh o were experienced professionals.   \n4.2. In 2014 , there was a war in Ukraine which put huge strain on Ukraine’s financial system, \nincluding the Bank.  During this period, and in the years that fo llowed, I contributed my \nown assets and funds to the Bank to help maintain its stability.  \n4.3. In early 2014, Mr Kolomoisky involved himself in politics.  I believed this would make the \nBank a target of political attacks directed at Mr Kolomoisky.  I therefore  agreed my  exit \nfrom the Bank with Mr Kolomoisk y in July 2014.   \n4.4. My belief that the Bank would be the target of political attacks directed at Mr Kolomoisky \nturned out to be correct.  Throughout 2015 and 2016 , the Bank was used as part of a \nsustained politi cal attack on Mr Kolomoisky before the Bank was ultimately nationalised \nin December 2016.    \n4.5. I had no knowledge of any of the  alleged  transactions that are the subject of the Bank’s \nclaims.  I did not procure any misappropriation of funds from the Bank.   If there has been \nwrongdoing,  it was not done by me, at my direction, or with my knowledge  or consent.   \n5. I provide my account of the matters relevant to the claims made by the Bank below.  \nB2/11/2\n \n3 \n MY BACKGROUND  \n6. I grew up in Dnepropetrovsk  (now renamed Dnipro) , an in dustrial city in the former USSR . My \nparents were modest  people.  My mother was an engineer and worked in the chemical industry. \nMy father was a shift worker. He worked days, nights and weekends until he died  at the age of \n56.  My parents had a  hard  life. I wanted more than that for myself  and for my family.  \n7. I studied hard and did well in school.  In 1984, I graduated from the Dnepropetrovsk Institute of \nCivil Engineering, with a specialist diploma in industrial and civil construction engineering . I then \ncom pleted the compulsory three -year period of work at the state’s allocation  in my specialist \narea , which the Soviet system required.  \n8. In 1987 , I decided to move out of the state system and try to make money on my own.  I became \nan entrepreneur and self-emplo yed trader for a while, before  I joined a company called Fianit \nin 1990 , which imported computers into the Soviet Union . I met Igor Kolomoisky  at Fianit and \nhe became a friend of mine . \n9. The late 1980s and 1990s were a period of dramatic and rapid change in Ukraine:  \n9.1. In the late 1980s, Ukraine was part of the USSR  and, although perestroika (President \nGorbachev’s project of economic reform) allowed limited private enterprise, the \neconomy was still far more tightly controlled than can easily be imagined now.  \n9.2. Ukraine declared independence from the USSR in August 1991,  which was ratified by \na popular referendum in December 1991.  \n9.3. Upon independence, the Ukrainian economy did not change to a free -market model \novernight but, over time, opportunities opened up for entre preneurs. It was however \na difficult time to do business : the Communist Party had been declared illegal , but \nlarge parts of the country’s industry were run by so -called “red directors” from the \nSoviet era who maintained control over much of the economy and  therefore an \nentrepreneur’s ability to do business.  \n10. This was a time of great opportunity for those who were entrepreneurially minded,  but success \nrequired a lot of hard work and a preparedness to take risks.  I was lucky and the  risks  I took \npaid off.  Things could very easily have gone against me and I would be in a very different \nposition today.   \nB2/11/3\n \n4 \n The development of my business interests  \n11. In the early  1990s, I was loosely in business with Mr Kolomoisky , Ale ksey Martynov, and Leonid \nMiloslavsky .  They  were  not my ‘partners’ in any formal or legal  sense, but I shared ideas, \ninitiatives and opportunities  with them .  We were just four people taking  business opportunities \nwherever they were presented to us .  There was n ever any  formal agreement about the \nbusine sses in which we invested.   If I had an initiative , I would usually take responsibility for \nrunning it  and offer a share to the others,  and when they had an initiative, they would do the \nsame .  We are each separate people and  each  of us  had our own individ ual projects  which the \nothers often , but not always, invested  in.   \n12. As time went by these interests separated further.  Mr Martynov entered politics in the early \n2000s and divested himself of the majo rity of his business interests  around that time .  Whilst  \nMr Kolomoisky and I were closest of that initial group , since around 2007 when I moved abroad , \nwe have tended towards our own individual projects.  It is therefore not right, as the Bank does \nin these proceedings, to  attempt to treat Mr Kolomoisky and mys elf as one.  We are both \nseparate people with separate interests.  I consider myself more international in outlook: I have \nenjoyed living and working abroad and I speak other languages.  Mr Kolomoi sky is more \nstaunchly Ukrainian, despite living abroad for m any years . He, I believe, feels more at home in \nUkraine and only speaks Russian – he lives and breathes Ukraine far more than I do.  This is part \nof the reason why, since 2007, we have tended towa rds our own individual projects . \n13. To give the Court an unders tanding of the size and extent of my business interests, I explain \nbelow the core businesses and investments  that I have been involved in.  \nImport business  \n14. One of the earliest initiatives, involving Mr Kolomoisky, Mr Martynov, Mr Miloslavsky and me , \nwas in  1990, when we started importing office equipment and other consumer goods from \nsouth east Asia.

One of the earliest initiatives, involving Mr Kolomoisky, Mr Martynov, Mr Miloslavsky and me , \nwas in  1990, when we started importing office equipment and other consumer goods from \nsouth east Asia. When Ukraine declared independence in 1991, computers were rare and in \nextremely high demand, especially by state -owned enterprises needing to modernize follow ing \nthe end of the Soviet era.  Through contacts in Singapore, computers and other merc handise  \nwere imported  from south east Asia.  The company through which this business was conducted \nwas called Sentosa . I was a shareholder  of this company  and it was nam ed after  an island I \nvisited on my first trip outside the Soviet Union :  Sentosa Island , off the coast of  Singapore . \nB2/11/4\n \n5 \n 15. At the time, as Ukraine was transitioning from its Soviet economy to a market economy, it was \nstill difficult to import products and diffic ult to obtain foreign currency.  The key to building an \nimport business was havin g the ability to secure or convert currencies as required, or failing \nthat, to be able to find barter solutions that would allow one to continue trading.  This acted as \na barr ier to entry for most.   Our import  business became very profitable and, before lo ng, it was \nturning over the equivalent of millions of US dollars  in Russian  Roubles and making very \nsignificant profits.  These  were huge sums at that time in Ukraine and gave  me the capital \nrequired to begin making other investments.  \nPrivat Bank  \n16. The success of Sentosa captured  the attention of Sergei Tigipko.  Mr T igipko, was the Deputy \nChairman at a state -owned commercial bank, Bank Dnipro.    \n17. In late 1991, Mr Tigipko approach ed the shareholders in Sentosa with a proposal.  He wanted \nto start his own bank. He  said that he had everything he needed except for the capital: he \nneeded 30 million Roubles (the equivalent of about 1 million US dollars ). That was a huge \namount of money in Ukraine at that time  (the average monthly salary was 200 Roubles)  and it \nwas hard to find from reliable people.   \n \n18. Mr Tigipko said that he wanted the shareholders  in Sentosa  to be shareholders of a new bank \nthat he would run.  After about two to three  months of discussion , we decided to found  \nPrivatBank  at the end of 1991 , and obtained a banking license  in March  1992.  The initial \nshareholders were Mr Kolomoisky , Mr Martynov, Mr  Miloslavsky and me.  We each held 25% \nof the shares of the Bank and we all s at on the Supervisory Board.  Mr Miloslavsky was the \nChairman , and Mr Tigipko was the Bank’s chief executive officer and ran the Bank on a day -to-\nday basis.   \n19. Mr Tigipko was well connected and had banking experience .  The Bank grew quickly under his \nleader ship.  It became  one of the bigge st commercial banks in Ukraine within only a few years  \nand had branches all over Ukraine.  The banking industry was in its infancy at the time .  There \nwas essentially an empty field  for new market entrants .  I explain the g rowth of the Bank and \nmy role in it, in further detail below.  \nSteel export business  \n20. Whilst Mr Tigipko was building and growing the Bank, I focused  on other  business es. \nB2/11/5\n \n6 \n 21. In 1992 and 1993, the original import business became more difficult .  However,  at the s ame \ntime , opportunities arose to make money from exports.  The shareholders  in Sentosa  therefore \nhad the idea of switching attention to the steel business.  Ukraine has extensive iron ore \ndeposits and the steel industry is its largest heavy industry.   At that time , China was buying up \nalmost any steel that it could find on the market.  \n22. The idea was to export steel bought from state -owned steel businesses to the Chinese market. \nThe steel business was able to buy steel from Ukrainian factories at low prices a nd then sell the \nsteel internationally for profit.  It was difficult negotiating the transportation and shipment of \nthe steel because  Ukraine was still  transitioning to a market economy, but the business \novercame the logistical difficulties.  Unlike the im port business, the export of steel generated \nrevenue in US dollars.   I was  now making many times what I had been making from my initial \nbusiness es.   \nOil trading and distribution businesses  \n23. The ever -changing economic landscape in Ukraine in the 1990s  crea ted problems  and \nopportunities . For example, there was, for a period, a deficit of oil products  in Ukraine , \nespecially for use in agriculture , which was the main industry in Dnepropetrovsk. Therefore,  the \ngovernment introduced quotas which  mandated that st eel exporters must  also import oil \nproducts for sale in the local market if  they were to continue their export business.  \n24. The steel business  had to navigate its way through this change.  To adapt, an oil trading business  \nwas established , importing oil prod ucts from the Baltic States, which were also transitioning \nfrom the Soviet system after gaining their own independence.  \n25. The oil trading business soon took over  from the steel business in terms of profits  (which I had \nnot anticipated) : what started as a re action or quick fix to the oil products  quota hurdle in the \nmetal export business ended up being a substantial business in its own right.  \n26. In 1994  and 199 5, there was a currency crisis in Ukraine with a large disparity between the \nofficial exchange rate and  the ‘market’ rate. One consequence was that large amounts of petrol \nstarted to build up in storage which could not be sold .  So, in addition to the oil trading business , \nthe shareholders  in the oil business and I  started to buy up oil product distribution  businesses, \nsuch as  petrol stations , and commercial fuel suppliers selling diesel as an industrial fuel, \nparticularly to companies in the mining  sector.  For example, the oil product distribution \nbusinesses  supplied diesel to the two largest manganese min ing and processing plants in \nB2/11/6\n \n7 \n Ukraine: Marganetskiy Gorno -obogatiteln iy Kombinat (“ MGOK ”) and Ordzhonikidze Gorno -\nobogatitelniy  Kombinat (“ OGOK ”).  Those entities could not  pay for diesel at the time due to \nthe foreign exchange rate , but the businesses  acce pted as payment delivery of manganese ore, \nwhich could then be  sold in other parts of what was a  very fast paced and developing market \neconomy  in Ukraine .  A buyer  for that ore was found in the Zaporozhe  and Nikopol  Ferroalloy  \nplants  – this was my first in troduction to these businesses.  \nPrivatisation  opportuniti es \n27. In the mid to late 1990s, the Government of Ukraine, led by the then -President Leonid Kuchma, \ncommenced a programme of mass -privatisation.  In 1995, privatisation started slowly in the form \nof pri vatisation certificates  being  given to e very citizen.  You could exchange your certificate for \nshares in former government enterp rises or you could sell them for cash .  Many chose cash:  \npeople in Ukraine had no exposure to the concept of business ownership , and in any case i t was \ndifficult to obtain any value from your investment if you only held a small number of shares .  \n28.

In respon se to this, t he Bank  set up a department to buy and sell privatisation certificates. The \nBank was in a pos ition to acquire  certificates  from its operations all over the country.   Mr \nMartynov, Mr Kolomoisky  and I  quickly realised that this was a major opportunity for us to \nacquire significant interests in state assets.  Accordingly, the three of us  (Mr Miloslavsky passed \naway aroun d this time)  started buying up certificates  from the Bank  and financed the acquisiti on \nof privati sation certificates from the profits that we re made from the oil and steel  businesses.  \nFerroalloy businesses  \n29. Mr Martynov, Mr Kolomoisky and I also  started pur chasing interests in various businesses that \nwere be ing gradually  privatised by the government, such as the Nikopol Ferroalloy Plant \n(“Nikopol ”).  Nikopol was , and remains , one of the largest global producers of manganese alloys ; \nbuilt during the Soviet pe riod and located close to  MGOK and OGOK.   It was possible to acquire \nan interest in Nikopol because  we had become a supplier of manganese ore to Nikopol, using the \nore we obtained from MGOK and OGOK .  This provided  an advantage over other potential \ninvesto rs as it provided us with  a better understanding of the economics of the business , and \ntherefore allowed for offer s to be made  to the government  on more attractive tender terms.   \nHowever,  none of us were connected to power in Kyiv and the process was very difficult.  I had \nto figh t very hard with my competitors to be able to compete for and win these assets . \nB2/11/7\n \n8 \n 30. Over time,  the ferroalloy business built up into a major enterprise .  The business comprised  \nmining and refining assets  including two mines (MGOK and O GOK ) and three ferroalloys plants, \n(Nikopol, Zaporozhe and Stakhanov ).  Nikopol is the largest  ferroalloy plant  in the world and \nStakhanov was also very substantial  (although it was lost in the Russian invasion in 2014 ).  By \n2007 , the ferroalloy portfolio  in which I had an interest  accounted for just over 10% of the global \ncapacity and was generating profits of hundreds of millions of US dollars per year.   \nOil exploration  and transhipment  business es  \n31. In addition to oil trading, I had also expanded my inte rests into oil exploration  and transhipment .  \nThe only exploration company in Ukraine was Ukrnafta.  Mr Kolomoisky and I (along with some \nminor partners)  held  40%. The m ajority shareholder was Naftoga z – a state -owned energy \ncompany .  Around this time,  Mr K olomoisky and I  had also invested in three businesses, called \nEximnefteprodukt, Odesnefteprodukt and Sintez Oil  which controlled an oil transhipment  \ncomplex in the port of Odessa, and acquired a fuel terminal in Illichivsk (now known as \nChornomorsk).  Mr K olomoisky and  I already had  interests in  thousands of petrol stations and \nhundreds of oil storage terminals from the oil trading business , and this meant that it was \npossible  to vertically integrate the se businesses.  This business was also generating hund reds of \nmillions of US dollars in profits by 2007 . \nOther businesses in Ukraine  \n32. Until around 2006  and 2007 , I was also very busy with other businesses in Ukraine in which I, \nalong with other investors,  had acquired interests following the government’s progr amme of \nprivatisation, particularly in  chemicals and steel manufacturing . \n33. I had acquired an interest in a chemical manufacturing company called Dniproazot, which \nproduce s fertilizers , mostly for export.  The company was experiencing problems with sourcing \nnatural gas to manufacture ammonia for use in its products.  Under regulations in Ukraine, \nbecause Ukrnaft a was part -owned by the state, it was required to sell part of its product to the \nstate -owned oil and gas company, Naftogaz , at lower than market pric es.  However , a decision \nwas eventually  made for Ukrnafta to lease one of its facilities to Dniproazot , and it would sell \nB2/11/8\n \n9 \n natural gas to it at higher prices to make more money .  This also became a very profitable \nbusiness.   \n34. I had also acquired interests  in iron ore mining and steel manufacturin g units, including : an iron \nmining and processing complex called Yuzhny GOK , the Sukha Balka iron ore mine ; and an iron \nand steel plant , and three coking plants in Dnepropetrovsk.  In 2007, these  assets were sold for  \n1 billion US dollars in cash and 1 billion US dollars in  share s in Evraz  plc, one of the largest steel \nproducers in the world .   \nMy move to London  \n35. In early 2007, I acquired a mining business called Ghana Manganese , on my own account.  Whilst \nI offered Mr Kolomoisky the opportunity to invest with me , he did not want to.  I proceeded \nwith the 132 million  US dollar deal alone.  \n36. Ghana Manganese owned a manganese mine in the Ghanaian rainforest which had supplied \nNikopol in Ukraine. The high -quality  ore had bee n exhausted but  there were still significant \ndeposits of lower grade ore.  As well as seeing the opportunity to secure a supply of ore from \nGhana Manganese to Nikopol, I also saw an exciting opportunity to establish a business that \ncould become a worldwide  supplier of se aborne manganese ore.  \n37. At this time in 2007 and 2008, I decided to take over Consolidated Minerals ( “ConsMin ”), an \nAustralian mining company which had synergies with my existing Ghana Manganese \ninvestment.  Again, this was an investment I ma de on my own .  I was heavily engaged in these \nbusinesses and travelled internationally many times a month.  ConsMin was a su bstantial asset \nand it needed an English -speaking  management  team , bank ers, accountants, lawyers and so \nforth.   Ghana Manganese and ConsMin ended up taking up  almost  all of my time  and it wasn’t \npossible for me to run those businesses properly from Ukraine .  I was also newly married to my \nthen -wife Sofia and splitting our time between K yiv and Vienna.  A large number of her friends \nhad moved to London and she wanted our children to benefit from an English education.  I \nagreed and we moved with our young fam ily to London in 2009.  The amount of time I spent on \nmy Ukrainian busine sses decreased substantially as a result.   \n38. I was very busy once I moved to London.  By 2009,  I had achieved much of what I had aimed to \ndo in business and I was determined to spend as much time with my young children as I could. \nMy objective was to provide a stable and comfortable environment for them in  London.  When \nI was not travelling for bus iness, I spent a lot of my time at home looking after my children and \nB2/11/9\n \n10 \n trying to be as involved as I could be in their upbringing.  I was also busy building a property \nportfolio in London, acquiring a number of prime residen tial and commercial premises both  \npersonally and for the benefit of my  family .

These investments were valued at hundreds of \nmillions of pounds and were a substantial undertaking in their own right.    \n39. Doing business in London was very  different from what I  had experienced in Ukraine.  Doi ng \nbusiness in Africa and Australia were similarly new and different in their own ways.  I spent \nmany days and weeks in meetings and conferences during this period, trying to learn and adapt \nto business in a new environment . I was also involved in charity and investing in real estate. I \nwas busy with my new life in London and that was my main focus at the time .  \n \n40. Around about this time (2008 and 2009), Mr Kolomoisky and I discussed unwinding and splitting \nour interests in th e numerous entities in which we were both invested in.  This suited me \nbecause I had just left Ukraine and was more interested in and focused  on my international \nbusiness interests.  For various reasons,  we ultimately decided not to go ahead with this \nprop osal.  \n \n41. Whilst Mr Kolomoisky and I did not proceed with the plan to split our investments, I began to \ndraw a distinction between my business interests in Ukraine and the business interests I \ndeveloped fro m London.  This was principally because the business interests developed after \nmy move to London were predominantly  on my own account, whereas the Ukrainian businesses \nhad been built up over many years and were subject to structures and business relationsh ips \nthat were legacies from earlier days.   As part of  my move to London , there was a restructuring \nof how these business interests were held and the Ukrainian assets were settled into trusts.  \nThis process was rushed due to UK tax considerations and resulted in the trust s accidentally \nacquiring indirect inte rests in entities in which they were not supposed to and in which I had no \nprior interest.  The Ukrainian businesses broadly continued to operate as they did before with \nlimited day-to-day input from me .  They retained their original corporate structures ( which I \naddress further below) and, as far as I am aware, continued to use the Bank as thei r primary \nfinancial institution  (I explain this further below).    \n \n42. With my relocation to London, I also started new banking relationships for my new businesses \nand f or my personal accounts  at major London -based financial institutions .  \n \n43. I have explained al l of this because I think it is important that the Bank, and my role in it, is \nunderstood in its proper context.  It was an important investment for me, but I was no t involved \nB2/11/10\n \n11 \n in its  day-to-day operations .  It was only a part of a very large and diverse portfolio of interests  \nthat I held and continue to hold .  Those interests  were all acquired prior to 2007  and generated, \nand continue to generate  today , very significa nt profits.  \nMY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BANK  \n44. As I have mentioned above, t he Bank grew  rapid ly.  It was entrepreneurial  and forward thinking.  \nIt was often  the first bank to introduce new products or technology to Ukraine :  it was the first \nbank to introduce V isa cards, the first to introduce mobile and then internet banking , and has \nfrom its early days been a pioneer in the use of technology in its business (both internally and \nin its interactions with its customers ).  \n45. As a consequence of the good management o f Mr Tigipko and later , Oleksander Dubilet (who \nhad been a deputy of Mr Tigipko and became CEO in 1998  when Mr Tigipko resigned ), the Bank \ngrew to become the bi ggest bank in Ukraine.  By 2016, the Bank had become systemically \nimportant for the Ukrainian fi nancial system.  There were over 2 ,000 branches all  over Ukraine, \nand branches or associated banks in Latvia, Cyprus and Russia.  The Bank serviced more than 20 \nmillion customers (at the time the population of Ukraine was approx imately 45 million)  and was \nthe dominant provider of point -of-sale banking infr astructure.  It was the largest and most \nsuccessful retail and commercial bank in Ukraine.  \n46. The Bank was a source of great pride to me.  It was very successful and my shareholding was \nvery  valuable in mone tary terms .  The Bank was also generating substanti al profits .  However, \nMr Kolomoisky and I  chose not to take profits  and allowed the Bank to  retain  that money as \ncapital.  I estimate that around 1.3 billion US dollars  was reinvested between 2010 and 2015  in \norder to allow the Bank to grow .  My other businesses were sufficiently successful that I didn’t \nneed to take dividends  from the Bank.  \nThe structure of the Bank  \n1992 -1997  \n47. From the beginning, the Bank was run by its management.  I was not a banker and neither were \nany of the other shareholders.  Whilst Mr Tigipko was not a shareholder of the Bank,  he was the \ndriving force behind it.  Mr Tigipko was a very talented banker and businessman.  He had \nextensive banking contacts , and a young and energetic team  around him.  He was very effective  \nand the Bank’s early success was driven by him.     \nB2/11/11\n \n12 \n 48. As I have explained above, w hen the Bank  was incorporated, all four of  its founding \nshareholders were made members of the  Bank’s Supervisory Board .  Mr Miloslavsky was the \nChairman and Mr Martynov was the Secretary.  The Management Board ran the operations of \nthe Bank on a day -to-day basis.  My role during this period was very limited.  \n1997 -2016  \n49. In 1997 , Mr Miloslavsky died  and I replaced him as Chairman of the Superviso ry Board .  The \nsimple reason for this was that neither Mr Martynov nor Mr Kolomoisky (the only two remaining \nshareholders excluding myself) wanted the role:  Mr Martynov had political ambitions and Mr \nKolomois ky just did not want to do it. In addition, I w as the only one of the remaining \nshareholders who spoke English.  The Bank was becoming more international at this time and \nMr Kolomoisky  and Mr Martynov thought that the Chairman should be able to speak Engli sh.  \n \n50. Around about the same time, Mr Tigipko le ft the Bank to pursue a career in politics.  When he \ndid, Mr Dubilet replaced Mr Tigipko as CEO of the Bank.  Mr Dubilet had previously been \nMr Tigipko’s deputy and had been with the Bank since 1992 .  Mr Dub ilet was also a very \nexperienced and talented ban ker and carrie d on where Mr Tigipko left off.  The Bank continued \nto grow and expand under Mr Dubilet’s leadership.  Mr Dubilet remained the CEO of the Bank \nuntil it was nationalised in December 2016.   \nMy role as Chairman of the Bank  \n51. After I became Chairm an of the Bank ’s Supervisory Board  in 1997, my invol vement with the \nBank increased  but I still did not have any day -to-day involvement in managing the Bank’s \nactivities , and the Bank continued to be run by its management (from this point, led by Mr \nDubilet ).

In recognition of this , and in order to ensure that management was \nproperly incentivized to run the Bank for the benefit of all of its shareholde rs, the Bank’s \nshareholders  decided to give around 10%  of the shares in the Bank to the Ban k’s senior \nmanagement  and the managers of some of its major branches.  \nB2/11/12\n \n13 \n 52. I have been shown a document from 2003 wherein the Bank recognises my employment as \nChairman of  the Supervisory Board.1  I believe that I also had an employment contract with the \nBank and was paid a salary of about 120,000 US dollars (equivalent) per year . \n53. The Bank was a well -organised and professional organisation.  It had a large legal  team, an \ninternal audit department an d detailed policies and procedures for the Bank’s internal \npractices.  In addition to this, it was audited by a large international accounting firm, PwC.  I \nrecall spending about two to four hours  a month (on average) on Bank -relat ed business.  I spoke \nalmo st exclusively to Mr Dubilet . I also occasionally spoke  to Mr Timur  Novikov , the head of the \nInvestment Business who dealt with investment banking, corporate issues and international \ntrade finance, both in my capacity as Chairman and as a client of the Ban k.  I also occasionally \nspoke to others at the Bank in my capacity as a client of the Bank, for example, I did occasionally \ndeal with Ms L yubov Chmona, the Head of the Budgeting Department.   \n54. Generally, Mr Dubilet would make arrang ements with my secretary to come to my personal \noffice  in Dnipro  to discuss any issues he thought needed to be discussed with me  and would \nprovide me with an update on anything he considered important .  I did not have  an office at the \nBank and rarely visit ed the Bank’s Head Office.  Mr Dubilet came to me for these meetings \nbecause I had limited  time and it was not feasible for me to visit all of the businesses I was \ninvested in.  My meetings  with Mr Dubilet  occurred ar ound once a month.  He used these \nmeeti ngs to update me generally on the Bank.  O ccasionally, he raised major strategic issues or \nissues that had a political elemen t but the discussions were usually uneventful .  \n55. The other aspect of my role a s Chairman was signing off on matters that required ap proval by  \nthe Supervisory Board.  In addition to the meetings I had with Mr Dubilet, a bout once a month \nI received a bundle of documents for signing.  These were generally either letters on which a \nsignature from the Chairman was requested or minutes of Supervisory Board meetings. The \nletters  had generally been signed already by a member of the Management Board in the usual \nspot at the bottom of the letter and included a stamp on the top right hand corner stating \n“approved” where I would sign as Chairman.  This was essentially a formality.  I would sign these \nunless I had a question.  If I did, I would ask for an explanation from Mr Dubilet or the relevant \nmember of the Management Board who had signed the letter.    \n56. Supervisory Board decisions  were generally made by circular resolutions, rather than at physical \nmeetings.   Decisions were made by the Board as a whole, rather than by me as Chairman .  I \n \n1 {PB0162591_0001}  \nB2/11/13\n \n14 \n don’t recall attending any actual physical meeting s of the Supervisory Board ( although I can’t \nsay for certain t here were never any) , but if the matters were important or unusual Mr Dubilet \nwould have raise d them wi th me when we spoke.  Generally, Mr Dubilet was the point of \ncontact with the other Supervisory Board members.  He would generally  discuss matters with \neach of us  individually , rather than us all discussing together. Occasionally, I would discuss \nmatters with Mr Kolomoisky directly but this was not the norm.   By the time the draft minutes \nhad reached me  for signing , the  matters  on the meeting agenda  had al ready been considered \nand approved by the Management Board , and I believed  that the minutes had been drafted in \nconsultation with the Bank’s legal team .  The draft minutes  would also have been reviewed and \nsigned by Mr Martynov who was the company secretar y.  The Bank was well organised and \nthere were a number of layers of control , which gave me comfort .  I would work my way through \nthe draft  minutes  that had been provided to me at my office in Dnipro in hardcopy .  When I had \nquestions, I would call Mr Dubi let who would explain the issue to me.   \n57. As part of the  process I have just described , I do recall signing minutes approving certain lending.  \nI was not involved in the Bank’s lending decisions on a day -to-day basis, but I believe there was  \na maximum  amoun t that the Bank could agree to lend without first obtaining the approval of \nthe Supervisory Board , though I don’t today recall exactly what that number was.  It is also \npossible that there may have been lending which may not have strictly required approval  by the \nSupervisory Board, but which the Management Board sought approval  from the Supervisory \nBoard  for in any event (possibly to protect themselves from criticism if the loan went bad).  \nThese requests did not occur with any regularity.    \n58. When these requ ests for approval came, they were provided at the same time as the other \ndocuments.  In each case, by the time I received  the application to approve , it had already been \napproved by the Credit Committee  and by Mr Dubilet and Mr Martynov.  As with any other  \ndocuments, when  I had questions , I would call Mr Dubilet  who would provide me with an \nexplanation of the relevant issue .  If the issue was clear to me , I would sign in the comfort that \nthe document had been through the Bank’s processes and procedures.  \n59. The manner in which I approached my role as Chairman  developed after I moved to London in \n2009.  As part of the sale of the steel business to Evraz in 2008, Mr Kolomoisky and I  were \nentitled to one seat on the board  of Evraz , which I took up .  Evraz is an Eng lish plc and I wanted \nto ensure I understood what was expected of me in the role.  I therefore discussed this with \nother Russian speaking members  of its board .  The importance of reviewing and understanding \nthe papers that were provided to m e in advance of  each meeting was stressed to me.  I was also \nB2/11/14\n \n15 \n told that I could be held personally liable if I was found not to have done my job properly .  I \nhadn’t really appreciated it earlier, but I realised around this time that I could also be liable in \nrelation to m y supervisory board positions in Ukraine.   \n60. The practice in Ukraine was not as formal as it was in relation to Evraz.  For example, I did not \nreceive board packs  or have regular meetin gs.  However, I sought to apply my experience from \nEvraz to the Bank.   I still operated in the same way as I have described above  (save that, because \nI was in London I spoke to Mr Dubilet more regularly by telephone rather than in person) , but I \nlooked mor e closely at the documents I was asked to sign and asked more questions of Mr \nDubilet.

Because I was no longer in Ukraine, I would ordinarily review and sign documents when \nI returned to Ukraine (usually once or twice a month).  If matters were urgent, do cuments were \ndelivered  to me in London and I would sign and return them  to Ukraine.        \n61. It is fair to say that I  saw t he Bank as the most stable business of all of my investments.  It was \na large , well-structured and professional organisation .  It was the biggest bank in Ukraine and \ncontinuing to grow; it was technologically  advanced; it had a large legal department; it had \nplaced Eurobonds and was regularly assessed by the ratings agencies.  The Bank’s financial \nstatements  were audited by PwC  and it was regulated by the NBU .  It was doing well  and from \nmy perspective as Supervisory Board member and shareholder there was no reason for me to \nbe any more involved in the Bank than I was .    \nMy relationship with  the Bank as client  \n62. There has been a n interrelationship between my business interests (and that of my partners  in \nthose i nvestments ) and the Bank since it first started in the early 1990s.  The growth of those  \nbusinesses and the huge amounts of cash they generated helped fuel the growth of the B ank.  \nIn the same way, the Bank played a role in the development of other busines ses.  Mr Kolomoisky \nand I  were the Bank’s largest clients.  This is not surprising given the size and breadth of our  \nother joint , and separate , business interests in Ukraine and the money  those businesses were \ngenerating on a daily basis.  \n63. The Bank provided  a number of services to us  and our businesses , but the core services were:  \n63.1. Personal banking ; \n63.2. Business banking;  \n63.3. Corporate structuring ; \nB2/11/15\n \n16 \n 63.4. Budgeting services ; \n63.5. Tender services;  \n63.6. Investment banking ; and   \n63.7. Prime broking.  \n64. I explain how I used the Bank’s personal and  business banking services , and investment banking \nand corporate structuring services below , as those services are most relevant to the allegations \nmade in these proceedings.  I don’t believe that the budgeting and tender services or prime \nbroking services  provided to me are particularly relevant so I don’t address them further save \nas to acknowledge that businesses associa ted with me used these services.  \nPersonal and business banking  \n65. As I have explained above, the Bank was only one part of a very large por tfolio of assets in which \nI had an interest (with others  or individually ).  Those businesses were – for the most part – all \nclients of the Bank and held accounts at the Bank.  Until around 2008, when I was preparing for \nmy move to London,  I also did most  of my personal banking with the Bank.  \n \n66. When the Bank first started , it was interested in lending to big borrowers , i.e. large state -owned \nfactories and commercial enterprises.  This was because in those early days there was no \nsignificant retai l lending bus iness  (although this later developed to become a major and \nimportant source of income for the Bank ).  At that time, and throug hout the life of the Bank, \ncommercial  lending itself was not generally the  way the  Bank (or other Ukrainian banks) made \nmoney.  Ra ther,  the Bank would tie  those customers into other services provided by the Bank \nincluding  payroll, currency exchange, budgeting , tendering  and other services .  Corporate \nlending was a way of bringing this business in.  The margins on lending were low and  the risks \nwere high .  In order to make the business profitable, the Bank  needed to offer more than just \nsimple banking ser vices .  As I understand it, this is the purpose of the Customer Service \nDepartment (known by its Russian acronym BOK):  selling and p rovid ing these services to the \nmost important  corporate clients of the Bank.  I have no doubt that companies in which I am \ninterested were clients of BOK, but I do not believe that I personally was a client.  I believe I was \na client of the VIP branch in Kyiv. \n \nB2/11/16\n \n17 \n 67. As far as I am aware, this commercial  lending and the services provided to these entities were \nprovided at market rates.  The Bank was run as a business and , as I explain below,  there  were \noutside checks on the costs of the services it provided to entities  associated with us , which  \nmeant that  fees charged were no higher (or lower) than market.  The vast majority of businesses \nin which Mr Kolomoisky and I have invested, have  outside par tners .  Those business es banked \nwith the Bank and received the full  range of services from it.  As a shareholder of the Bank, it \nwas in my interest s for the Bank to make as much money as it could off those business \nrelationship s.  On the other hand, it was  in the interests of the business (and my co -investors ) \nto keep tho se costs as low as possible.  The external partners in our businesses would always \nheavily scrutinise the fees charged by the Bank to the businesses they were interested in to \nensure they w ere at market rates . \n \n68. It is difficult for me to say how much money attributable to me or companies in which I had an \ninterest was held in accounts at the Bank on any given day.  However, given  the huge profits \nthat were being generated by these businesses , I would expect that number to be in the billions \nof US dollars (or  equivalent).  Similarly, the Bank would have earned very large sums by way of \ninterest and fees on services provided to thes e entit ies.  While  the Bank was a very significant \nbank in its own right, the sheer size of my business interests (and the levels o f cash generated \nby them) is likely to mean that  companies associated with me were very important to the Bank \nand likely acco unted for a very significant portion of the Bank’s income.    \n \n69. Given that all of these businesses  were run by their own  management  teams , I would not have \nbeen involved in dealing with the Bank on their behalf.  This would be the responsibility of the \nrelev ant business’ s management.  I am however aware that many of these businesses obtained \nloans from  and made deposits with the Bank,  and also used  the other services it provided , as \nthis was a core aspect of the Bank’s business ( as described above ).   \n \n70. At least until my business interests shifted from Ukraine from 2007 onwards, much of my own \nmoney was also in the Bank.  Again, these wer e very significant sums.  I couldn’t say how  much , \nas it was not something which I paid attention to, but I expect that the sums held in my personal \naccounts or on the accounts of companies in which I am ultimately interested , might regularly  \nhave  exceed ed hundreds of millions of US dollars . \nB2/11/17\n \n18 \n Corporate structuring and administration  \n71.

The post -communist years were fast -moving and exciting.  As a result, business interests often \ndeveloped organically.  I think about my businesses and investments by reference to  their \nactivities or the assets they own , not in terms of the structures of corporate  entities  through \nwhich my interests are held .  The Bank provided services  in structuring  investments  and \ncollaboration with the administrators of  those structures , which I used .  It was generally \nnecessary t o set up different structures for different investments as I had different co -investors \nand each investment  was different.    \n \n72. The department within the Bank that provided these services (among other investment banking \nservices)  was the Investment Banking  and Corporate Finance Department.  This Department \nwas headed by Mr Novikov.   The Investment Banking and Corporate Finance Department could \ndetermine where and how ( including  the precise corporate structure ) to hold any new  \ninvestment.  The Investment Banking and Corporate Finance Department often helped me with \nthe sale and acquisition of some of my assets (including shares and interests therein) and \nstructuring some (but not all) of my investments.   \n73. The way in which I held my interests in the 1990s and 2000s was not straightforward. As I have \nexplained above, my business interests did not have their origins in a ‘western’ business \nenvironment.  Instead they developed as Ukraine was transitioning from the Soviet system that \nheavily restricted private enterprise.  At that time, how companies were controlled was still \ndeveloping and there was competition for the ownership of assets.  Corporate raids  were a \ncommon feature of the developing Ukrainian economic landscape  and t hese raids  could be \nassisted by the ineffectiveness within the political, judicial and law enforcement functions of the \nstate.   In those circumstances it made sense to put in place structures to protect the ultimate \nshareholders of assets – both to protect  the asset from potential corporate raids , or to allow \nshareholdings to be built up without triggering the need to declare those shareholdings.  Larger \ninterests could be held in a number of smaller stakes through different companies in different \njurisdict ions.  This is the reason corporate holding structures that were created during this time \nare often complicated  and opaque .  \n \n74. I rarely (if ever) knew the names of the companies that  were set up: I d idn’t need to know the m. \nThe Investment Banking and Corpor ate Finance Department  would tell me if I asked .  The Bank \ntook charge of structuring and coordinating  with the administrators of the companies.  I knew \nB2/11/18\n \n19 \n the businesses I was invested in and I was familiar with my high er-valued  assets  and \ninvestments , but I  rarely (if ever) knew the chain of corporate ownership.  \n \n75. As a result  of these proceedings, I have had to look more closely at  some of  the corporate \nstructures used to  hold assets on my behalf.  There appear to be a large number of companies \nin which I ha ve or used to have  interests (some of which are very small).  I have not heard the \nnames of the vast majority of these companies , and I do not personally know the vast majority \nof the individuals involved  in these structures . \n \n76. I return to this below in rel ation to the apparent involvement of companies in which I have ( or \nhad) an interest in the “scheme” that is the subject of these proceedings.  \nTHE CRISIS IN UKR AINE  \nThe Russian -backed incursion into Ukraine  \n77. From 2009 until 2013, I was living happily with m y young family in London and was busy with \nmy business and philanthropic interests.  Things in Ukraine  then  became very bad very quickly .  \nI explain this all b elow as it is important context to the difficulties that the Bank, and the \nUkrainian financial system, faced  from 2013 onwards . \n \n78. In 2013 , Ukraine  was in crisis . There was huge pressure  within  Ukraine  on Ukraine’s then -\nPresident, President Yanukovych, to sign an association agreement between Ukraine and the \nEuropean Union.  The Russian President, Vladi mir Putin , did not want Ukraine to move closer to \nEurope.  In September 2013, President Putin effectively imposed an emba rgo on Ukrainian \nproducts entering Russia (its primary  market) by imposing additional and arbitrary customs \nrequirements.  Ukrainian in dustry was (and still is) very much reliant on and connected to \nRussian money.  We have common machinery, agriculture,  and other industry :  all of this having \nbeen born in the former Soviet Union .  Overnight, Russia put a wall up and everything stopped.  \nPresident Putin did this because he wanted to show Ukraine that if it joined the EU, then Russia \nwould cut it off.  \n \n79. After  this happened, the Ukrainian economy went into a  freefall  and President Yanukov ych \ntravelled to China to seek an emergency loan.  Duri ng his return from Beijing to K yiv, he diverted \nhis flight to Sochi, where Russia offered him a 15 billion US dollar loan  facility.  The price of this \nrescue facility was that Ukraine would not enter into the contemplated association agreement \nB2/11/19\n \n20 \n with the EU.   President Yanukov ych accepted the facility from Russia and did not sign the \nassociation agreement.   \n \n80. This set off massive protests and civil unrest in Ukraine in late November 2013 . This was the \nstart of the revolution.  Students  gathered  in the central  square in K yiv and were beaten by \npolice.  By 22 February  2014 , there were riots on the streets in Kyiv.  Many people were killed .  \nPresident Yanukovych  escaped to Russia  and t he country was left without a government.   \n \n81. Things very quickly got worse.  Imm ediately after President Yanukov ych fled to Russia, Russian -\nbacked militia  entered Crimea and took control of strategic and administrative sites across the \nregion.  Within less than three  weeks, Crimea had been declared a part of Russia.  This was \nfollowed  by a rmed insurgenc ies in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.  The country was at war \nwith Russia and with itself.  The West was nationalist Ukrainian, the East was pro -Russian.  Th ose \nfrom the West  have very strong memories of the atrocities committed by the  Red Army and \nthose from the East have a st rong affinity  to Russia .  The separatists  reignited those tensions.  \nUkrainians were killing Ukrainians in Donetsk and Luhansk and the Ukrainian  army was being \nforced further and further west daily .   \n \n82. I have foun d it difficult to adequately convey the gravity of this situation to those who weren’t \nliving it at the time.  Although I was living in London at the time, I followed events closely \nthrou gh the news on television and the internet.  There was widespread pan ic in Ukraine.  I \nremember being fixated on the daily troop movements.  It was the first thing I looked at on the \nnews every morning and I would check these online repeatedly throughout t he day.

Armed men would come to people’s \napartments and seize their houses or take possession of their cars.  Teenagers were walking the \nstreets with Kalashnikovs.  It was anarch y.  Businesses and property were stolen or destroyed.  \nMany people were killed daily.  Those who could afford to leave , did.  Whilst the open warfare \nwas occurring in the East, the threat was advancing towards K yiv, and K yiv itself felt unsafe .  \nThere was real concern that this was the beginning of the end of Ukraine as a sovereign state.   \nImpact of the war on the Bank  \n84. Prior to 2014, the Bank had been doing well.  Whilst it had suffe red along with the rest of the \nglobal financial system following the 2008 financial crisis, the Bank had recovered .   \nB2/11/20\n \n21 \n 85. The war and political situation in Crimea and East Ukraine caused great damage to the Bank. \nThe Bank had a large  presence  in Crimea which was lost entirely.  It also lost branches in Donetsk \nand Luhansk. Cash in the billions of Hryvnia (the Ukrainian  currency, referred to as UAH) \ndisappeared from the vaults of the branches.  Panic amongst depositors , caused by the threat \nof war and occupation , led many people throughout Ukraine to withdraw all of their savings.  \nThis was not a problem faced by the Bank alone.  The entire Ukrainian financial system was on \nthe brink of collapse.  I believe t he loss caused to the Bank by the annexation of Crimea alone \nexceeded 30 billion  UAH . \n86. I spoke  to Mr Dubilet throughout this peri od and more regularly th an normal.  H e was very \nconcerned for the Bank.  It was a very shaky time and Mr Dubilet told  me he was doing all he \ncould to keep the Bank afloat.  To be clear, Mr Dubilet’s concern was not the Bank’s loan book : \nhis concern was the Bank’s liquidity in the face of massive withdrawals of deposits which was \noccurring at the same time as a  sharp deva luation of the UAH  - all caused by the civil unrest.  I \nremember that he was under a great deal of stress through this period and was havin g difficulty \nsleeping.  \n \n87. Whilst this was plainly a very difficult time for the Bank, it was also a very difficult time  for \nUkraine .  I was very  worried about my friends and family in Ukraine and the future of my country \nin the face of the threat posed by the separatists . \nMr Kolomoisky’s decision to enter politics  \n88. It was in this context that Mr Kolomoisky  became the Governor of the Dnepropetrovsk Region \nin March 2014.  The first I heard about this was when I saw it on the news.  I was very upset  \nabout Mr Kolo moisky entering politics .  I phoned him and had a very strong conversation with \nhim.  I told him that if you become a politician in an influential region, then you will need to take \na polit ical side.  Whatever side you take the other side will attack you.  There was a power \nvacuum at that time  and a total loss of order.  It was clear there would be a fight for power.  Mr \nKolomoisky  told me that I didn’t understand – the country was in danger and it was his duty to \nact.  I was very upset.  I was never into p olitics .  Mr Kolomoisky  assured me tha t he would only \nhold the rol e temporarily until a new president was appointed  and would then resign , which \ncalmed me down at the time .   \n89. Elections were held on 25 May 2014 and Petro Poroshenko was sworn in as President  on 7 June \n2014.  By late June, Mr Kol omoisky  still hadn’t resigned as he had told me he would.  On about \nB2/11/21\n \n22 \n 1 July  2014 , I told Mr Kolomoisky  that, given that he had not resigned, I no longer wished to be \na shareholder of the Bank .  I understood the way powe r works.  Mr Kolomoisky  could not hold  \na political position whilst also being seen by others to control a bank that was central to the \nUkrainian financial system.  I did not want to  have any responsibility  for the Bank when it could \nbecome a target of poli tical games  directed at Mr Kolomoisky .  The problem for me was that at \nthat time , during the period of hostilities, it was impossible to sell my interest in the Bank to \nany third part y.  Mr Kolomoisky  recognised this and said he would buy me out.   \n90. Through out this pe riod, the war in eastern Ukraine continued.  Mr Kolomoisky  was in the news \nevery  day.  It was reported that he had a private army.  I don’t believe those reports were true .  \nThe people fighting against the separatists  were not Mr Kolomoisky’s ar my.  They w ere \nvolunteers fighting for Ukraine against the separatists .  The Ukrainian army and militias were \narmed and directed by the Ministry of the Interior.  Mr  Kolomoisky told me that he provided \nthem with equipment, fuel and other things to help.  He did not give them weapons .  He gave \nhuge amounts  of his own money during this period to protect Ukraine .  He became a hero \novernight .   \n91. Whilst I was living safely and happily with my family and friends in Belgravia, President Putin \ndesignated  two people as “St ate Terrorists”:  the Ukrainian Minister of Internal Affairs, Arsen \nAvakov, and Mr Kolomoisky .  In the Donbas region of Ukraine , separatists were taking target \npractice with Mr Kolomoisky’s image on the targets .  There were also reports that separati sts \ntravelled to Dnipro to try to kill him.  Mr Kolomoisky  told me that he  had to use a different route \nto travel from his home to his office every day to avoid ambush.  I felt guilty  that I was sitting in \nLondon avoiding the difficulties when Mr  Kolomoisk y was in Ukraine  dealing with this national \ncrisis .  I therefore didn’t feel comfortable pushing Mr Kolomoisky to formalise the agreement \nto acquire my shares in the Bank at that time.   Similarly, it was not something I raised with \nMr Dubilet as he was als o busy  working to stab ilise the Bank.  \n92. The Minsk Agreement was initially signed  by Russia and Ukraine  in September 2014 and there \nwas a further agreement  signed  in February 2015.  Neither agreement stopped the fighting in \nthe Donbas,  but they did result in a belief that the front lines would not move further west.   \nThings started to stabilise around this time.   Similarly, Mr Dubilet was also able to stabilise thi ngs \nat the Bank with the support of the NBU.  \nB2/11/22\n \n23 \n My exit from the Bank  \n93. At the beginning of 2015, it was announced in the press that the Ukrainian government \nintended to enact a law imposing personal liability on the shareholders of a bank for any \nfinancial lo sses suffered by the bank.  This was an unusual law and I  thought that it unfairly \nplaced liabili ty on shareholders of Ukrainian banks  for matters outside of their control .   \n94.

I drafted a letter to President Poroshenko , \nalthough I did  not end up sending it .2  I set out what I believed to be the causes of  the systemic \nproblems facing Ukraine’s financial system and highlighted the impact of tightening regulation \nat a time of crisis for Ukrainian  banks .

This was an unusual law and I  thought that it unfairly \nplaced liabili ty on shareholders of Ukrainian banks  for matters outside of their control .   \n94. When I saw the announcement , I was quite angry .  I drafted a letter to President Poroshenko , \nalthough I did  not end up sending it .2  I set out what I believed to be the causes of  the systemic \nproblems facing Ukraine’s financial system and highlighted the impact of tightening regulation \nat a time of crisis for Ukrainian  banks .  In short, the point I made in the letter was that the state \nseemed to be shifting responsibility  for the crisis in the banking sector  from senior state officials \nonto the banks and their owners.  I  did not believe this was fair or reasonable as it expos ed \nshareholders in Ukrainian banks to losses caused by things that were wholly outside of their \ncontrol.  After I cooled down, I thought better of sending the letter.  It was overly antagonistic \nand so I decided not to send it.  \n95. This development meant that I could not wait any longer for Mr Kolomoisky  to put into effect \nwhat we had agreed in July 2014  and buy my shares in the Bank.  I could not be responsible for \nlosses that might be incurred by the Bank for reasons that were entirely outside of my control .  \nThe issues that I had in mind were the same issues that I had included in my letter to President \nPoroshenko  that I have summarised above and set out more fully in that letter .  This risk was \nnot something that I was willing to accept.    \n96. So, I met Mr Kolomoisky  sometime in March 2015  and told him that  we need to put our prior \nagreement into effect .  Unfortunatel y, by this point, it was already too late for me  to sell my \nshares in the Bank .  For me to leave the Bank Mr Kolomoisky and I  need ed to apply t o the NBU \nfor approval  for me to sell my shares to him .  It was highly unlikely that the NBU would give me \nthe ap proval to sell to Mr Kolomoisky  given that would result in him owning approximately 90% \nof the Bank.  \n97. Around about the same time  as I spoke to Mr Kolomoisky , I spoke to Mr Dubilet  and told him of \nmy desire  to leave the Bank  and my agreement with Mr Kolomois ky to do so .  He told me I could \nnot do it .  It could not be done  while Mr Kolomoisky was Governor  of Dnipro  and he was \nconcerned that any attempt by me to leave c ould risk a nother  run on the Bank.   He didn’t want \n \n2 {GB_NC_0005629}  \nB2/11/23\n \n24 \n there to be further destabili sation  given the difficulties the Bank had recently faced .  I was \nessentially stuck.  I was very unhappy about the whole situation.  \n98. The solution Mr Kolomoisky and I  landed on was that he agreed to take over my share in the \nBank on the basis that this transfer would be formalised as soon as it was possib le to do so.  In \nthe meantime, Mr  Kolomoisky and each of the Bank’s signi ficant  shareholders  (and executive \nmanagement)  would indemnify me against any losses that I might incur arising out of or \nconnected to the operation s of the Bank .  As I have explained above, I was particularly \nconcerned about the impact of external events on the Bank (i .e. the 2014 crisis, massive \ncurrency devaluations and political interference).  The new law made the shareholders liable \nfor losses s uffered by the Bank irrespective of whether they could have done anything to \nprevent it.  The indemnity was not what I wanted but it was all Mr Kolomoisky and I  were able \nto do in the circumstances.  \n99. I wanted to find a way to step away from the Bank.  A suit e of documents was prepared by \nSkadden (my then London lawyers) in March and April  2015.   There was a waiver of any liability \nthat I might have during my time as Chairman and an indemnity.  I resigned as Chairman on 30 \nApril 2015.  Mr Volodymyr  Stelmakh re placed me.  He was a very experienced banker who had \nform erly been the Head of the NBU.  He remained Chairman of the Bank until it was \nnationalised.  Viktor Lisitskyi, another independent member , was added to the Supervisory \nBoard at the same time.  \n100. Mr Kolom oisky and I  signed the  waiver and  indemnities on 12 May 2015 to take effect from \n1 July 2014  (the “ Deed of Waiver ”3). The indemnities  took effect from that date because that is \nthe date on which Mr Kolomoisky and I had agreed that he would take over my sha res in the \nBank.  When Mr Kolomoisky and I  signed the i ndemnities, I said  to him , “From now on, any \npaper you want me to sign, you have to give me a written  instruction ” (or s ome thing to that \neffect) .  Over the coming weeks I signed materially identical wa iver and indemnity agreements \nwith Mr Novikov, Mr Dubilet and Triantal4 (who were the other significant shareholders of the \nBank) .  \n \n3 {GB_NC_0001719}  \n4 {GB_NC_0001879} {GB_NC_0001730} {GB_NC_0001726}  \nB2/11/24\n \n25 \n NATIONALISATION OF THE B ANK  \n101. From early 2015, things started to impr ove.  Whilst there was still war in the East, the countr y \nbegan to stabili se.  With the stabili sation of the geopolitical situation, and with the assistance \nof emergency lending from the NBU, the Bank was no longer in crisis.   The Bank had room to \nbreathe  and was working with the NBU on a recovery plan.   \n102. I rem ember M r Dubilet relaying all of this to me in positive tones.  Whilst the sums that needed \nto be repaid to the NBU were high (and the interest rates even higher), Mr Dubilet told me that \nthe retail b anking and credit card business was generatin g around ha lf a billion  US dollars of \nprofits annually – more than enough to repay everything.  All of this  kept the management of \nthe Bank busy but wasn’t something on which I personally focused .  I had my agreement with \nMr Kolomoisky  that I would leave the Bank as soon as it was possible to do so and the indemnity \nto protect me in the meantime.  I was just waiting for things to calm down so that Mr Kolomoisky \nand I  could put that into effect.   \n103. Unfortunately, as I had anticipated when he took the role as Governor, M r Kolomoisky started \nto attract negative attention from those in power.  Mr Kolomoisky had become very popular in \nUkraine  by protecting  it from invasion .  Mr Poroshenko’s Presidential Administration came to \nbelieve, through his popularity in Dnipro , his influence over  the 1+1 media group , his ownership \nof the Bank  and his financial resources , that he was a threat to power in K yiv.  He was also seen \nto have been deliberately antagonistic  to President Poroshenko and those around him :  it was \nsaid that Mr Kolo moisky’s television channel 1+1 regularly painted the President and his wife in \na poor light.  I remember Boris Lo zhkin, who was President Poroshenko’s chief of staff, but also \none of my friends, mentioning these complaints to me in early 2015.  \n104. These issue s came to the fore in around March 2015.  The Presidential Administration tried to \nconvince me to persuade Mr Kolomoisky  to resign  as Governor .  Discussions took place over \ntwo days in the Presidential Administration buildings.  Along with the President, I  spoke with \nthe Prime Minister, Mr Yatsenyuk  and the Minister of Internal Affairs , Mr Avakov .  Mr Lozhkin \nwas also at these meetings .  No pressur e was put on me, but they used me as a conduit to put \npressure on Mr Kolomoisky.  They mentioned the Bank  in th e context of these discussions .

They \nsaid words to the effect of : “Why do you need the trouble ?  Convince Mr Kolomoisky  to resign \nand become a n ormal businessman. ”  I took this as a threat.  My concerns from 12 months \nprevious ly about the consequences of Mr Kolomoisky involving himself in politics  were \nconfirmed by this meeting.   \nB2/11/25\n \n26 \n 105. I put a lot of effort into convincing Mr Kolomoisky to resign  as Governor .  I had previously been \nvery concerned about this type of thing occurring .  Now it was clear that unless  he resigned, Mr \nKolomoisky and all associated with him would be a target.  As part of my discussions with \nPresident Poroshenko  about persu ading Mr Kolomoisky to resign, he  agreed with me that he \nwould make positive statements  about  the Bank  in the press (which occurred) .5  This was  \ndiscussed because I was concerned that attacks on Mr Kolomoisky could lead to a flight of \ncapital from the Ban k.  However, Mr Kolomoisky refused to resign and  was dismissed as \nGovernor by President Poroshenko on 26 March 2015.    \n106. I returned to London the day after Mr Kolomoisky  was dismissed as Governor .  When I arrived \nat Farnborough Airport from K yiv around 26 M arch 2015, I was told by the Border Force Officer \nthat someone wanted to see me.  The man I then spoke to told me  he w as from MI6 and said \nthat the British Government wanted me to relay a warning to Mr Kolomoisky (who he referred \nto as my business partner) .  He opened a file and said he need ed to read  a statement of the \nBritish Government  to me .  After he closed the file,  he told me that he wanted to pass on the \nfollowing message: ‘ The British Government supports Ukrainian independence – Mr Kolomoisky \nneeds to stay quiet and behave well ’ (or something to that effect).  I agreed to pass the message \non to Mr Kolomoisky.   \n107. Following Mr Kolomoisky’s dismissal there  were discussions with the President  and his \nadministration  about a “comprehensive agreement” to resolve the issues between them.  I \nunderstood from conversations with Mr Kolomoisky at the time that these discussions  involved \nan issue to do with Mr Gennadiy Korban,  the support of Mr Kolomoisky’s TV channel 1+1 for \nPresident Poroshenko,  the NBU’s support of the Bank and a number of other issues.  I wasn’t \ninvolved closely in the negotiation,  but I was aware that it was happening.  Those discussions \nwere led by Mr Kolomoisky , although  I had some limited involvement in relation to Ukrnafta \n(which was in a dispute with the State and which was therefore part of these discussions)  which \nI discussed with President Poroshenko a nd others .  I was aware that Mr Kolomoisky was being \nput under serious pressure to reach  agreement by the Presidential Admi nistration .  The threat \nwas that Mr Kolomoisky’s people would be prosecuted  unless he agreed .  The agreement was \nultimately fina lised in April 201 5.6  It included a provision whereby the NBU would support the \nBank and a commitment by Mr Kolomoisky that related party loans be repaid.  I don’t now recall \n \n5 {GB_NC_00056 33} \n6 {IK1/32 -48} \nB2/11/26\n \n27 \n exactly what was driving this,  but I believe it is likely to have been a request on o ur part that \nthe N BU provide support.   \nThe steps taken by the NBU to nationalise the Bank  \n108. From around the middle  of 2015, there were  an ever -increasing set of demands being made by \nthe NBU.  It is apparent to me now that the intention all along was to na tionalise the Bank  for \ndifferent reasons  that came together .  The US and the IMF saw Mr Kolomoisky’s perceived \nability to control the Bank as a risk to Ukraine’s financial system .  President Poroshenko believed \nhe could use this as cover to obtain the supp ort of Mr Kolomois ky’s TV network, 1+ 1, which he \nthought was necessary to retain the Presidency.    \n109. My role from this period onwards was relatively limited .  I had resigned my ro le as Chairman \nand had the benefit of the waivers and indemnities .  That said, I could not ignore  what was \ngoing on at the Bank.  Whilst I had the indemnities,  I was still on the Supervisory Board and to \nthe outside world, the Bank was still directly associated with me.  My credibility and my legacy \nwould inevitably be linked to the success or failure of the Bank.  I also retained my interest in \nthe Bank until there was a sale to Mr Kolomoisky.  I was therefore concerned to ensure the \nissues were resolved , and was generally kept updated by Mr Dubilet and Mr Kolomoisky over \nthis period  and did what I could to assist the Bank and Mr Kolomoisky  to satisfy the NBU’s \ndemands.  \nThe 201 5 Stress Test  \n110. In April 2015, the NBU required the Bank to undergo a ‘stress test’ to assess the adequacy of its \nregulatory cap ital.  In July 2015, the NBU publi shed a report on the results of the first stage of \nits review, which stated that the Bank required approximately UAH 16 billion (the equivalent of \nabout 700 million  US dollars at that time) of additional regulatory capital . I was made aware of \nthese develo pments by Mr Dubilet, although I cannot recall precisely when this occurred.  \n111. In September 2015, the NBU introduced new guidance  on the treatment of certain collateral \nfor the purposes of calculating the Bank’s regulatory c apital.  I did not have a detailed  \nunderstanding of the new rules, but I understood the substance of the changes.  Security that \nwas previously acceptable as collateral for the purposes of calculating capital adequacy ratios \nwould no longer be accepted.  T he change in interpretation of the  regulations meant that whilst \nthe Bank’s balance sheet was in no worse position than it had been previously, its capital \nadequacy ratios dropped significantly overnight . \nB2/11/27\n \n28 \n 112. I don’t have a detailed recollection of the discuss ions I had with Mr Dubilet about t his, but I do \nrecall him making the point that the NBU could not reasonably expect the Bank to bring in new \ncollateral to replace previously acceptable collateral overnight  – it would take time and the Bank \nwas working on it.  When I discussed these matter s with him then and over the next 12 months, \nhe was always of the view that the Bank was financially sound.  He stressed to me that the Bank \ndid not have a problem with bad lending, rather it was simply an issue of regulat ory capital that \narose because of the changes in the rules.  \n113. The final result of the “stress test” was published in December 2015.  The NBU found that the \nBank required additional capital of approximately UAH 110 billion (around 4.7 billion US dollars) \nto comply with capital adequacy ratios :  more than 6 times the additional capital the NBU had \nstated was required only months earlier .  I was shocked and, whilst I was very busy on other \nmatters in December 2015 and January 2016, raised it with Mr Dubilet at some point over this \nperiod. He ass ured me it was an accounting issue and the Bank was working on a plan to address \nit.   \nRequest by Mr Duilet to contribute assets to the Bank  \n114. Sometime towards the end of  201"}

He ass ured me it was an accounting issue and the Bank was working on a plan to address \nit.   \nRequest by Mr Duilet to contribute assets to the Bank  \n114. Sometime towards the end of  2015, I recall Mr Dubilet asking me whether I could contribute  \nsome assets  as collater al to shore up the Bank.  I do not recall discussing specific assets with \nhim on that call but I do recall agreeing to help .   \n115. Around about this time, I was presented  with a list of assets that had been identified  by the \nBank .  I remember approving the lis t although I cannot now recall whether this  (or the \nconversation with Mr Dubilet) was part of t he Recovery Plan that was being discussed in late \n2015 and early 2016 (and which I explain below) or independent of it.  \n116. I understand from my solicitors that  assets ultimately owned by trusts settled by me were \npledged  between 2011 and 2014  in support of s ome of the loans that are  the subject of these \nproceedings .  I was not aware of these pledges prior to the commencement of these \nproceedings .   \nThe February 2016  Recovery Plan  \n117. I was aware that the NBU required the Bank to produce a recovery plan to address the apparent \ncapital shortfall.  I was also aware that this involved the transfer of a large number of assets \nowned by Mr Kolomoisky or myself onto the balance sheet of the Bank and  the retention of  \nearnings in the Bank  (which had  been  done historically in any event) .  Mr Kolomoisky also \nB2/11/28\n \n29 \n agreed to contribute additional capital to the Bank personally in 2018 and 2019.   I understand \nthis was agreed in February 2016 . \n118. The asset transfers  required the transfer of UAH 30 billion of assets onto the balance sheet of \nthe Bank.  Mr Kolomoisky was on the front lines of these discussions.  I do not know the details \nof what was discussed or how the assets to be transferred wer e identified.  I do n ot recall now \nwhether Mr Kolomoisky ever asked me for permission to transfer the assets that were \ntransferred  – I cannot now recall whether the list I mention approving above was in this context \nor in relation to something else .  In an y case, o nce this was  all over Mr Kolomoisky and I would \nthen need to talk about how we  might  account between us for the  assets that were ultimately \ncontributed.  \n119. Shortly after this, in mid to late March 2016, I had a call from Mr Dubilet who told me he saw  \nthat I had around 100 million US  dollars in one of my personal accounts  at the Bank .  He asked \nme whether I was prepared to  transfer that sum onto the balance sheet of the Bank  to assist \nwith the steps being taken to comply with the NBU’s new requirements .  I believe the proposed \ntransfer was part of  the Recovery  Plan.  Mr Dubilet told me that the Bank was performing well \nand they were doing everything that the NBU had asked of them.  Given this, and f or the reasons \nI have stated above, I was content  to transfer the money.  However, I didn’t think it was \nappropriate that it come directly  from me , given my agreement with Mr Kolomoisky that I would \nleave  the Bank as soon as that wa s possible.  So instead, I gave  the money to Mr Kolomoisky so \nthat he could con tribute it as capital  to be reconciled  between us  at a later date .  That is \nreflected in the  alteration of our respective holdings in Triantal  (one of the shareholders in the \nBank), which Mr  Kolomoisky reflected in his letter to me dated 28 March 2016 .7 \nAssertions by the NBU of Non -Compliance with the Recovery Plan  \n120. On around 7 April 2016, the NBU wrote to the Bank, Mr Kolomoisky and me to state that the \nBank had not complied wit h the Recovery Plan.8  I don’t recall whether I saw this letter at the \ntime, but  I expect I would have been told of it by Mr Dubilet or Mr Kolomoisky.  \n121. When preparing this witness statement, I have  been shown a letter from Mr Kolomoisky sent \non 10 July 2016  where he states  that the Bank  had yet to comply with the Recovery  Plan agreed \nwith the NBU and wherein he offers  a personal guarantee to the NBU in respect of the Recovery  \n \n7  {GB_NC_0001871}  \n8  {PB0074674_00001}  \nB2/11/29\n \n30 \n Plan .9  I don’t recall seeing this  letter at the time  but I do recall Mr Dubilet asking me whether I \nwould give a personal guarantee together with Mr Kolomoisky.  He told me that Ms Gontareva  \nwanted both of us to give personal guarantees.  I refused and it was never raised with me again.  \nThe 30 September Letter   \n122. On around 27 September 2016, I received a letter from Mr Kolomoisky  that he had written \npursuant to the Deed of Waiver.10  The letter directed me to sign a letter that Mr Kolomoisky  \nhad prepared in draft to send to Ms Gontareva at the NBU.  The draft referred to the Bank’s \nRecovery Plan  and the difficulties it had complying with it .  It said that Mr Kolomoisk y and I  \nwould cooperate fully with the NBU in relation to the nationalisation of the Bank if we were \nunable to comply with the Recovery Plan and requested the NBU to consider a state -supported \nre-capitalisation of the Bank via an issue of new shares to be purchas ed by the Ukrainian state .  \nMr Kolomoisky told me that this letter had been dictated to him by Ms Rozhkova ( the Deputy \nHead of the NBU) .  I didn’t want to sign it.  \n123. Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Dubilet then asked me to fly to Geneva to meet them to discuss it.  Th ey \ntried to convince me to sign the letter by saying it was just a formality. They told me that they \nhad been told by Ms Rozhkova  that everything had been prepared for the NBU to take \nPrivatBank out of the market  if either of us  did not sign , includ ing all  the necessary board \nresolutions to make that happen.  They explained that they needed this letter to show the NBU \nthat the shareholders of the Bank  were  committed to improv ing the Bank’s financial health.  It \nwas something the NBU had asked for app arently  to satisfy the IMF.  Mr Kolomoisky had already \nsigned it.  It was just my signature they required .  I still did not want to sign it, so they suggested \nI go to Kyiv (I was planning to go  anyway for Rosh Hashana ), and meet with Ms Rozhkova to \nhear it  from her directly .  They also said that if I didn’t  sign it, I would be to blame when  the \nBank was taken out of the market . \n124. I flew to Kyiv the next day.  When I arrived, I called my friend Mr Lo zhkin , who was the Chief of \nStaff to the President  at the tim e.  I told him about the letter I had been asked to sign and asked \nhim what was going on.  He said he didn’t know anything about it and he advised me to discuss  \nit with the President.  He was able to arrange for me to meet the President  at the airport in K yiv \nthe following day.

I flew to Kyiv the next day.  When I arrived, I called my friend Mr Lo zhkin , who was the Chief of \nStaff to the President  at the tim e.  I told him about the letter I had been asked to sign and asked \nhim what was going on.  He said he didn’t know anything about it and he advised me to discuss  \nit with the President.

He explained the pressure that he was under fro m the IMF  and that Ukraine  \nrequired  further funding  from th em.  He said that the letter  didn’t mean anything – it was just \nto show the IMF  (or words to that effect) .  He told me that it was best that I meet with \nMs Gontareva so that she could explain the d etails to me.  I left the meeting feeling positive.  \n125.  I arranged to meet with Ms Gon tareva either that day or the following day .  She did not want \nto meet me at any official premises  so we met at Mr Lozhkin’s apartment  over th e lunch  break.   \nShe said that 40% of the banking transactions in Ukraine  went through the Bank.  She believed \nMr Kolomoisky could shut down the entire banking system with the push of a button.  She called \nit a red button threat.  She confirmed to  me that Ukraine was currently in negoti ations  with the \nIMF for a further tranche of funding.   \n126. Ms Gontareva  tried for an hour to convince me to sign the letter. She  told me  its purpose was \nto show to the IMF and that it wasn’t the NBU’s  intention  to take the Bank  out of the market . \nShe said I n eeded to give them this letter so that the IMF would take the pressure off the NBU \nand allow them  to help the Bank comply with the Recovery Plan.  She said the letter would stay \nin her safe.  It would not be shown to the  market.  It was just to show the IM F.  She then showed \nme a draft board meeting decision declaring  the Bank insolvent  and withdrawing its banking \nlicense .  I took this as a threat of what would occur if I did not sign.  \n127. She spent a lot of time talking abou t the threat of taking the Bank out of the market .  She also \ntalked about the ‘Transformation ’ (which I discuss further below)  and said that they were \nworking hard with Mr Kolomoisky and the people at the Bank to finish that process.   She also \nsaid that th e Surkis brothers , prominent Ukraini an businessmen,  had 230 million US dollars on \ndeposit at the Cyprus branch of the Bank.  She suggested to  me that Mr Kolomoisky and I should \ntake this money and put it into the Bank as capital  and that  Mr Kolomoisky and I  could  give them \nsome assets in exc hange.  Essentially what she was saying was that we should take their money, \nreinvest it into the Bank as capital and then repay them  by transferring other assets to them \nthat we owned.  I was shocked by her suggestion . \n128. Ultimately,  this discussion, togethe r with the conversations I had with the President, \nMr Kolomoisky and Mr Dubilet, convinced me to fall in line and sign the letter.  I signed the \nletter after the meeting and gave it to Ms Rozhkova, Ms Gontareva’s deputy , before flying back \nto London.  \nB2/11/31\n \n32 \n Trans formation  \n129. In September and October  2016 , I was made aware of the  so-called  Tran sformation  by \nMr Dubilet.  I had no personal involvement in this process and did not understand the detail.  \nAll I knew was that there was a further request made by the NBU that  we needed to comply \nwith in order to keep the Bank alive.  Again, this process was being run by  the NBU and being \ndiscussed with  the Bank.  \n130. Whilst the Transformation was under discussion, the NBU announced a further stress test on \nthe Bank that would be un dertaken by an independent  audit firm.  E rnst & Young  were \nappointed to this role and undertook an unscheduled inspection on 17 October  2016 .  Again, I \nwas not involved in this process but I remember being updated by Mr Dubilet.  He told me that \nthe EY aud it took place during the process of effecting the Transformation .  The Transformation \nrequired  replacing loans to certain borrowers with loans to new borrowers and  the transfer of \nhundreds of pledges over valuable assets.  At the time the inspection took p lace, the loans had \nbeen transferred from the old borrowers to new borrowers but the security ov er the new loans \nhad not been put in place.  So overnight, the situation  went from one where the loans were \nsecured to one where they were not.  I was told by M r Dubilet that this was all done at the \ndirection of the NBU.  As a result , EY published a report indicating that the bank held insufficient \nregulatory capital.   \n131. I remember at the time Mr Dubilet mentioning a letter o r comment made by EY to the effect \nthat they thought we needed more time to comply with the agreed processes but that they \nwere pressured  to finalise their report based on the information available to them.  I also \nremember him telling me that there was a large team from the NBU inside the Ban k and that \nnothing could be done with out their oversight and approval.  \nMeeting in K yiv with the Finance Minister  \n132. In early November  2016 , I was in Kyiv for reasons unrelated to the Bank.  While I was there, \nMr Kolomoisk y phoned me and asked me if I could at tend a meeting on his behalf with the \nMinister of Finance, Mr Dan yliuk.  I understood that Mr Kolomoisky had been in discussions  \nwith him and had arranged the meeting but could not attend because he was very sick.  He \nwanted me to accompany those that were  assisting him so that there was at least one \nrepresentative of the shareholders there .  I agreed to attend on his behalf.  The meeting was an \n“off the record” meeting, held at the club in the Cabinet  of Ministers , a quiet building adjacent \nto the main sit e. \nB2/11/32\n \n33 \n 133. Mr Danyliuk did not talk about nationalisation  during this meeting , but he did talk about the \ngovernment taking a share  of the Bank  and we had an overall discussion about this possibility .  \nWe discussed different iterations of a deal .  I was prepared to  hand over a share in the Bank to \nthe Ministry of Finance if that is what they required to secure the future of the Bank :  leaks from \nthe NBU were already putting the Bank under pressure  by this t ime. There was then further \ndiscussion about percentages and  terms but nothing was agreed.  We left the meeting with an \nagreement to come back and have further discussions.  \n134. At the time, I thought this was a genuine discussion, but looking back at this now  I think it was \nall part of a game.  They had no intention o f doing any deal and had already decided that they \nintended to take all of the Bank.  I believe the real purpose of this meeting was to string us along \nto buy another month in order to ensure ever ything was ready for the nationalisation.  \nNationali sation  \n135. I didn’t have any further discussions with the NBU or the Presidential Administration but I \ncontinued to speak to Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Dubilet.  After the results of the stress test were \nannounced, the Bank was put in a very difficult position.  Mr Dubilet  and Mr Kolomoisky told \nme that they  believed that the NBU was influencing press reporting by leaking information that \nthere were problems at the Bank.  This spooked depositors and there was a run on the Bank.  \nBillions of UAH were being taken out of the B ank every day.

On around 1 6 December  2016 , I remember being away in Dubai when I wa s called by \nMr Kolomoisky. He told me he had been up all night in negotiations with the President and other \nmembers of the Presidential Administration  and they had reached agreement on a letter that \nhe wanted me to sign .11  The Ukrainian ambassador to the UAE  came to my hotel in Dubai so  \nthat I could sign the letter.  The letter had the effect of voluntarily handing  over the Bank to the \nState.  There was nothing else we could do.  The NBU had put the Bank in a n impossible  position.  \n137. The Bank was nationalised tw o days later.  \n \n11  {IK0007049_0001}  \nB2/11/33\n \n34 \n THE ALLEGED SCHEME  \n138. I understand that the Bank alleges that Mr Kolomoisky and I controlled all significant decisions \nmade by the Bank and that we procured , and were the ultimate beneficiaries of , the \nmisappropriation of  USD 1,911,877,385 of t he Bank’s funds between April 2013 and September \n2014.  I have been shown the statements of case and understand that it is alleged that this \npurported misappropriation was carried out as follows:  \n138.1.  Between April 2013 and August 2014, the Bank made a series o f loans (which it calls \nthe “Relevant Loans ”) to 47 Ukrainian companies and 3 Cypriot companies (the \n“Borrowers ”) for a total value of  UAH 14,736,650,000 and USD 1,857,900,000 . \n138.2.  Between May and August 2014, 46 of the Borrowers entered into 54 purported supp ly \ncontracts with the Third to Eighth Defendants (the “Relevant Supply Agreements ”) \nfor the future delivery of certain goods  and made pre -payments under those \nagreements totalli ng USD 1,911,877,385 .  The Bank says that no goods were ever \ndelivered but the pre-payments were never returned by the Third to Eighth \nDefendants  and that Mr Kolomoisky and I were the ultimate beneficiaries of those \nmonies . \n138.3.  Although the Relevant Loans were  apparently repaid through new loans made either \nto the same or different borro wers, the Bank claims that such new loans were not \ngenuine and that such repayments are invalid .  It says that the sum of around USD 1.9 \nbillion remains outstanding  under the Re levant Loans . \n138.4.  The Bank’s case is that Mr Kolomoisky and I were able to procure this alleged \nmisappropriation because , in addition to controlling all significant decisions at the \nBank,  we owned and/or controlled all of the Borrowers  as well as the Third to Eighth \nDefendants.  \n139. I did not procure the misappropriation of USD 1.9 billion fr om the Bank in the manner set out \nabove (or at all) and, as I will explain further below, I had no knowl edge of any of the \ntransactions by which it is said to have been carried out .  As I have explained  above, I was living \nabroad throughout the period of t he alleged misappropriation and I was focusing on other \nbusiness interests.  I had no involvement in the  Bank’s day -to-day operations (save as a \ncustomer).  \nB2/11/34\n \n35 \n 140. In the context of these proceedings , I have been shown examples of the loan agreements that \nare said  to have formed part of the Relevant Loans (including the “ Loan File Supply \nAgreements ”)12 and accompanying examples of the Relevant S upply Agreements upon which \nthe Bank relies.13  I have never seen these agreements before  and was unaware of this lending . \nI certainly did not give any instructions to anyone at the Bank to enter into these transa ctions.   \nAs I have set out above, I was asked as Chairman of the Supervisory Board to approve various \ntransactions from time to time.   However, I did not  approve these  agreements and  I was never \nasked to do so.   Moreover, i f these transactions did indeed t ake place, then they were not \nbrought to my attention by the Credit Committee or the Man agement  Board of the Bank .   \n141. The Bank’s case that I procured the transactions c omprising the “scheme” set out above appears \nlargely to be based on the allegation that ( whether with Mr Kolomoisky or otherwise), I \ncontrolled all significant decisions at the Bank and owned and controlled all of the Borrowers \nand Defendant Suppliers.  I have already explained that I did not control sign ificant  decisions at \nthe Bank.    \n142. Since the commencement of these proceedings , I have had the opportunity, through my \nsolicitors, to investigate the position in relation to the Borrowers and Defendant Suppli ers.  \nThose investigations have established that , during the Relevant Period , certa in entities in which \nI had an interest (albeit in most instances indirectly and in small percentages) were apparently \ninvolved in some of the transactions  which are said to have formed  part of the “scheme”.  \nWithout waiving privilege in that work, my inter ests in those entities (as pleaded in  my Defence \nand the Further Information that I have provided ) were ascertained from the relevant corporate \nservice providers and public records research into the ownership chains of those entities.    \n143. Save for some limit ed exceptions which I address below, I had no knowledge prior to the \ncommencement of these proceedings that I had any interest in any of the Borrowers or \nDefendant Suppliers .  I had never even heard of  the vast majority of these companies .  I have \nset out the extent and nature of my interests in the Borrowers and the Third to Eighth \nDefendants  in Appendix A  to my Re -Amended Defence.  I can confirm that, to the best of my  \ninformation and  belief, the information set out in Appendix A  to my Re -Amended Defe nce is \ntrue.  \n \n12 {PB0021581_00001 } {PB0045023_00001 } {PB0117609_00001 } {PB0117610_00001 } {PB0138884_00001 } \n{PB0080059_00001 } {PB0038869_00001} { PB0038870_00001 } \n13{IK0000288_0001}  {PB0334346_00001}  {PB0026054_00001 } {PB0038876_00001 } \nB2/11/35\n \n36 \n 144. Similarly, I do not personally know the vast majority of the individuals that are said to be \ninvolved in these companies, whether they be the directors or ultimate beneficial owners.  My \nsolicitors have id entified many as employees of Cypriot service providers and others as \nemployees of the Bank.  Again, I had never heard of most of these people at that time, let alone \nspoken to them.   \n145. There are a small number of  individuals associated with companies said to be involved  in the \nscheme that I do recognise  (and there may well be others that I have met before  but do not \nnow recall ).  I address these below : \n145.1.  Sergei Cheklanov (UBO of the Third Defendant  until 2016):  I knew  Mr Cheklanov as a \nsocial acquaintance .  He died in 2018.  \n145.2.  Andrey Romanovskiy ( UBO of the Sixth Defendant ):  Mr Romanovskiy is a well-known  \nbusinessman in Ukraine.  I do not personally know him, but I do know of him.   \n145.3.  Mikhail Kiperman  (UBO of the Seventh Defendant ):  Mr Kiperman is a well-known  \nbusinessman in Ukraine.  He is also a friend and business associate of mine.   \n145.4.  Andreas Marangos (Dir"}

Mikhail Kiperman  (UBO of the Seventh Defendant ):  Mr Kiperman is a well-known  \nbusinessman in Ukraine.  He is also a friend and business associate of mine.   \n145.4.  Andreas Marangos (Director of the Fifth Defendant ):  Mr Marangos was formerly a \npartner at the Cypriot law firm and corporate service pr ovider, So focleous, until he  \nstarted his  own  firm, Marangos and Hadjipapa.  Both So focleous and Marangos have \nprovided corporate administration  services to companies owned by trusts of which I \nam a discretionary beneficiary.   \n146. Accordingly, and as far as I am aware , I did not own or control any o f the relevant entities  during \nthe relevant period.  I do not know whether Mr Kolomoisky controlled any of the relevant \nentities  but, even if he did, it was not with my express, implied or standing approval.   \n147. Even if  these entities were involved in the all eged “scheme”, I do not believe that this supports \nany inference that the scheme was carried out on my instructions or with my knowledge , and it \nwas not .  In each case, t hese entities (i.e. the entities that I have a n interest in that were part of \nthe “scheme”) formed part of a structure  that had in the first instance been  incorporated and \nstructured with the help of the Bank .  Whilst some of these entities may at different times have \nheld  assets in which I had a bene ficial interest , they were never “my” companies.  The assets \nwere , in a very broad sense, partially  “mine” but the companies through which they were held \nwere not .   \nB2/11/36\n \n37 \n 148. This is demonstrated by addressing the entities in which trus ts of which I am a beneficiar y held \nmore than an insignificant interest.  I address each of these below.   \n148.1.  LLC Dorteks and LLC Uniks :  These  are two of the Ukrainian Borrowers under Loan \nAgreement Nos. 4D14270I14 and 4D14272I15, and Loan Agreement No. 4Yu1 4262D,16 \nrespectively.  Corporat e records indicate that 50% of the shares in each of these \ncompanies were ultimately owned by the trustee of a discretionary trust, of which I \nwas a beneficiary. These companies were initially unfamiliar to me; however, my \nsolicitors have identified commun ications to which I am a party that relate to these \nentities.17  Having looked at the email communications in question, whilst I don’t \nrecognise or recall the names “Dorteks” or “Uniks”, I do recall the assets that they \nheld .  In around 2005 , we had acquire d rights to build on land in Kharkiv, eastern \nUkraine.  That project had not progressed due to various issues.  In an email to me \ndated 12 March 2013, Mr  Novikov reminds me of the investment, identifies the issues \nand asks me what he wants me to do about t he land rights.  In response, I tell him not \nto fight , by which I meant that we would give up the land rights .   \n148.2.  The purpose of Mr Novikov’s email is not to discuss the intermediary companies, but \nto discuss the asset that those entities held.   Once I have  confirmed to him that we \nwill not fight, the rights to that land are lost and LLC Dorteks and LLC Uniks are empty \nshells.  Whilst I recognise that on the face of the corporate records, the trustee of a \ndiscretio nary trust of which I am a beneficiary, reta ins ownership of those companies  \neven after the asset had gone , that is not the way I saw it.  Once they no longer held \nthe asset , my relationship with them ended.  I understand from my solicitors  that it is \nonly after the loss of the land rights that thes e entities entered into the borrowing \nthat is the subject of these proceedings.   \n148.3.  LLC Alfatrader :  LLC Alfatrader is one of the Ukrainian Borrowers under Loan \nAgreement No. 4A14101I .18  Corporate records indicate that 40.88% of the shares in \nthis company we re ultimately owned by the trustee of a discretionary trust, of which \nI was a beneficiary.  It appears that these shares came to be owned by the trustee \nindirectly in April 2009.  I have no personal knowledge of this and have no recollection \n \n14  {PB0117610_00001}  \n15  {PB0117609_00001}  \n16  {PB0045023_00001 } \n17  {GB_CC_0000083}   \n18  {PB0080059_00001}  \nB2/11/37\n \n38 \n of this entity  prior to the commencement of these proceedings.  Alfatrader does not \nappear to have owned any assets  during the Relevant Period .  Accordingly, as with LLC \nDorteks and LLC Uniks, during the Relevant Period, Alfat rader appears to have been  a \nshell company u nder the control of the Bank.   \n149. As will be apparent from a review of A ppendix  A to my Re -Amended Defence, the other interests \nthat I have admitted in entities associated with the “scheme” are de minimis  and indirect.   I can \nconfirm that I was not aware tha t these entities were used in this way by the Bank and no \nauthorisation to use them in that way was given  by me  (or, to the best of my knowledge, the \nTrustee) .  These companies appear to have been used by the Bank for its own purposes.  \n150. The Bank  also allege s that (together with Mr Kolomoisky) I was the beneficiary of the alleged \nmisappropriation.  As I understand it, this is based on the allegation that I owned and controlled \nthe Third to Eighth Defendant s and so benefitted from the receipt by them of the “u nreturned \nprepayments”. As I have said above, I did not own or control any of the Third to Eighth \nDefendants.  Moreover, a s I understand it, and whilst this was not something I was aware of at \nthe time,  based on the information provided by the Bank  during these proceedings , those \nmonies were immediately transferred  away  by the Third to Eighth Defendants .  I therefore did \nnot benefit from these transfers and I do not understand the Bank to be alleging tha t I \nbenefitted from these transfers in some other way.     \n151. If there has been wrongdoing, it was done within the Bank.  It was not done by me, at my \ndirection, or with my knowledge , consent  or acquiescence .   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB2/11/38\n02.11.2021 \n02.11.2021 \nB2/11/39\n \n40 \n \nCertificate of compliance  \nI hereby certify that:  \n1.
