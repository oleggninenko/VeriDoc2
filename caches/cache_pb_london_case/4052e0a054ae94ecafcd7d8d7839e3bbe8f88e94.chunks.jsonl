Consequently, the claim has a narrow focus on limited facts relating to specific draw downs of money in 2013-2014 which were \nallegedly received by the English anchor Defendants (D3-D5) and the BVI Defendants (D6-D8).  \n The alleged causes of action based on thes e facts are contrived, defective and bound \nto fail. In particular:  \n(1) It is clear that the alleged mi sappropriations, if they took place,1 did not result \nin a loss on anything like the scale claimed. That is because the vast majority \nof the funds advanced by the Bank under Relevant Drawdowns which are \nalleged to have caused the Bank loss were returned to the Bank and accepted by it in discharge of the Borrowers’ liabilities. A claim that the Bank \nnevertheless suffered loss in the full amount claimed would be unarguable as \na matter of English law, and the Bank’ s own expert on Ukrainian law, Mr \nBeketov, confirmed in cross-examinati on that (unsurprisingly) Ukrainian law \nis no different in this respect. In ligh t of Mr Beketov’s oral evidence, it is \nplain that the repayments not only disc harged the Borrowers’ liabilities but \nalso discharged any liability D1 migh t have had for wrongfully procuring the \nadvances of funds to the Borrowers. This is the “ Repayment Defence ”, and \nit disposes of at least c.96.8% of the Bank’s claim.\n2  \n(2) Further, and in any event, the funds alleged to have been misappropriated \nwere all drawn down before 1 Oc tober 2014. The contemporaneous \n \n1  See further Section E3 below. \n2  The amount owed by Tamersa and Prominmet is USD 75million: Davidson1/4.22 { D2/1/21 }. The \ntotal value of the Relevant Drawdowns is USD 2,335,943,519: FAJS1/2.2(a) { D4/1/4 } \nAA3/3/4\n2 \n documentary evidence demonstrates unambiguously that the Bank knew of \nthe facts and matters of which it now complains in October or (at the latest) \nearly November 2014. The Bank’s witne sses of fact confirmed when cross-\nexamined that it was entirely within th e Bank’s power to file its claim at any \ntime between January 2017 and the expi ry of the limitation period, but it \nchose not to do so. In those circumstances the claim filed on 21 December 2017 was out of time and statute-barred under Ukrainian law, and there is no \nbasis for exercising any discretion to extend the limitation period. D1’s “Limitation Defence ” is a complete defence to the whole of the claim.\n3 \n The Court should have no sympathy with the Bank for the position in which it finds \nitself:  \n(1) The Bank is a Ukrainian entity owned by the Ukrainian state. D1 and D2 are \nUkrainian nationals. All the relevant conduct took place in Ukraine. As a result, the claims are governed by Ukrainian law.  \n(2) The obvious place to sue D1 and D2 was therefore Ukraine. There is no doubt \nthat the Ukrainian courts had jurisdicti on to determine any claims against D1 \nand the Bank accepts it could have sued in Ukraine at any time from at least \nthe beginning of 2017.  \n(3) Had the Bank sued in Ukraine, it would have been able to make a claim which \nwas not limited to loss arising from the (largely repaid) Relevant Drawdowns \nbut comprised any and all loss caused by unlawful lending procured by D1 \nand D2 – a loss which the Bank says am ounted to at least USD 5.5 billion. \nSuch a claim would have been not only more natural and le gally coherent but \nalso far more straightforward factua lly, since the unperformed loans would \nhave spoken for themselves: there would have been no need to carry out any \nanalysis of the kind undertaken by the fo rensic experts in this case involving \nthe identification of the “ ultimate source of repayment ” of loans.  \n \n3  The Additional Claims brought in July 2020 were  new claims which were themselves time barred: \nsee Section F10  below. \nAA3/3/5\n3 \n (4) Despite that, the Bank chose to bring cl aims in England instead because it \nsaw tactical advantages in doing so.

(W hat those advantages  were has never \nbeen explained but they no doubt included the ability to obtain worldwide freezing and asset disclosure orders.)  It could only do so by asserting causes of action against three worthless Englis h companies, D3-D5. Together with \nD6-D8, D3-D5 formed a group of six fo reign suppliers who had received pre-\npayments under 54 supply agreements\n4 from customers of the Bank in the \naggregate amount of USD 1,911,877,365 between 28 May and 1 September 2014\n5 and had failed to repay the money. \n(5) While D1 and D2 were domiciled in  Switzerland in December 2017 and could \nnot be sued in England as of right, Switzerland and the UK were parties to \nthe Lugano Convention on Jurisdicti on. Under Article 6(1) of that \nConvention, the Bank could bring claims against D1 and D2 if those claims \nwere “ so closely connected ” with the claims against D3-D8  that it was \n“expedient to hear and determine them  together to avoid the risk of \nirreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings ”. \n(6) This presented the Bank with something of a “ jurisdictional straitjacket ” \nwhich forced the Bank consciously to choose to bring a na rrow claim against \nD1 and D2 rather than try to claim fo r the whole of the loss it might have \nclaimed to have suffered. The claim advanced in these proceedings was carefully and deliberately confined to a claim in tort that D1 and D2 had \nprocured the misappropriation of funds advanced by the Bank which represented the “ expense ” of the Bank alleged to cause the “ unjust \nenrichment ” of D3-D8. Accordingly, D1 and D2 were alleged to have \nmisappropriated the same sum of money that D3-D8 had received – precisely USD 1,911,877,365. \n It is because of the need to tailor its claims against D1 and D2 to fit this \njurisdictional straitjacket that the Bank faces the fundamental difficulty presented \n \n4  Lewis.Aff1/95 { H1/1/22 }.  The Bank has identified 82 payments under 54 supply agreements: \nThompson1/Appendix 3-3-9 { D1/108 } \n5  See Chronology { AA1 }; see also Thompson1, Appendix 3-3-9 {D1/108}  \nAA3/3/6\n4 \n by the Repayment Defence. That Defence w ould not have been available to D1 if \nthe Bank had proceeded with more straight forward and obvious claims available to \nit in Ukraine. Nothing done by D1 or D2 forced the Bank to sue in England, and \nthe fact that the only clai m that could be brought in En gland is a flawed one is a \nproblem solely of the Bank’s own making. \n Similarly, while the Bank has not fully explained (still less evidenced) the reasons \nwhy it delayed until 21 December 2017 to br ing proceedings, its witnesses did not \ndispute that it could have brought its claims  against D1 and D2 at any time in 2017. \nIt is thus impossible to conclude that the Bank, using reasonable diligence, could \nnot have brought proceedings even in  England (let alone Ukraine) by \nOctober/November 2017. However, to the extent that the de cision to bring \nproceedings in England and not Ukraine contributed to its missing the limitation \nperiod, that is again something for whic h the Bank has only itself to blame.  \n The Bank fully anticipated these difficulties when it decided to bring these claims \nin England as both potential defences were  anticipated in an Affidavit filed in \nsupport of the WFO. It has made its bed an d must now lie in it.  The claims which \nare the subject of the proceedings cannot succeed under Ukrainian law and must be dismissed.  \n These Closing Submissions do not address th e other defences referred to in D1’s \nOpening Submission"}

The claims which \nare the subject of the proceedings cannot succeed under Ukrainian law and must be dismissed.  \n These Closing Submissions do not address th e other defences referred to in D1’s \nOpening Submissions, namely (i) that the alleged misappropr iation involved no \nunlawful conduct, and (ii) that any unlawf ul conduct did not cause the alleged loss. \nWhile D1 denies the allegations against him as a matter of fact, it is accepted, in \nlight of the evidence as to Ukrainian law,  that (i) if D1 had procured the alleged \nmisappropriations, D1 would have been in breach of fiduciary duties owed to the \nBank as a member of the Supervisory Boar d, and (ii) such a breach would have \nbeen causative of the loss occasioned by the advance of funds pursuant to the \nmisappropriations. That being the case, it is  unnecessary to addr ess any of the other \nissues relating to unlawfulness and causation on which the parties and the experts disagree. The fact that D1 is not seek ing to have the claim dismissed on these \nadditional grounds does not, of cour se, affect the overall outcome. \nAA3/3/7\n5 \n \n THE EVIDENCE \n The Bank’s witness evidence relates almost entirely to the Limitation Defence, and \nis therefore addressed in detail in Section  F below. \n The Defendants called no factual witne sses. The Bank complains about this \ndecision but D1 takes the view that the Bank’s claims against him are misconceived \nin principle and as a matter of Ukra inian law and barred by limitation. These \nDefences succeed without there being any n eed for evidence to be given by him or \nothers.6 D1 relies on the evidence given by the Bank’s own witnesses and, where \nrelevant and necessary, the burden of proof and the failure of the Bank to prove its \nallegations. \n The expert evidence on forensic account ancy and valuation is addressed in Sections \nA2 and D4(3)  respectively of the Quantum Annex .7 If D1 is right about his \nRepayment Defence, very few of the fo rensic accountancy or  valuation issues \nmatter. Where they might, they are mentioned in these submissions. \n So far as the Repayment and Limitation Defences are concerned, they largely turn \non the expert evidence on Ukrainian law. As to this:  \n(1) The Bank’s Closing makes a sustained attack on D1’s expert, Mr Alyoshin.8 \nSome of these criticisms are misplaced or overstated. However, as matters have turned out, it is unnecessary to  reach any view as to Mr Alyoshin’s \nreliability as an expert because the or al evidence of the Bank’s own expert, \nMr Beketov (which was not contradict ed by any other expert) altogether \nfailed to support the Bank’s case. To th e contrary, Mr Beketov’s answers in \ncross-examination confirm that, insofar as they depend on the application of \nUkrainian law, both the Repayment Defe nce and the Limitation Defence must \n \n6  Over the last year or so, Mr Kolomoisky himself has been under increasing public scrutiny in \nUkraine. Indeed, as the court will probably be aware from the press, his home was searched on 1 \nFebruary 2023 and matters culminated in his arrest over the summer. He remains detained in Ukraine at the time of filing these Closing Submissions. It is unsurprising that in such circumstances he \nshould prefer to keep his powder dry, particularly where the claims in England can be shown to be \nmisconceived without the need for him to give evidence. \n7  Quantum Annex {AA3/4/7} \n8  Bank.Closing/16(2) {AA2/15/16}  \nAA3/3/8\n6 \n succeed.

As a result of his concessions, \nthe Bank’s case as a matter of Ukrain ian law has been fatally undermined. \nNothing was salvaged by a re-examination which broke all the rules against leading questions and was effectively st ructured to (i) make clear to Mr \nBeketov that his answers in cross-examination had been unhelpful, (ii) make him re-read relevant parts of his repor ts and ask him to confirm that he \nintended to maintain that evidence (eve n though they were totally inconsistent \nwith his oral answers), and (iii) havi ng reminded him of what he had been \nsupposed to say, to ask him to comment on some scenarios with that fresh in \nhis mind. Even then, his answers were insufficient for the Bank to maintain \nits case as a matter of Ukrainian law. \n(3) Because his oral evidence was so destructive of the Bank’s case, and so \nsupportive of the Defendants’, it is unnecessary for D1 to seek to undermine Mr Beketov’s overall credibility as an expert. Insofar as there are any points where he supported the Bank’s position, however, the Court should not treat \nhim as inherently reliable:  \n(a) While the Bank criticises Mr Alyosh in as lacking independence, Mr \nBeketov’s instructions as an expert  have come mainly from the Bank \n(in at least 5 sets of proc eedings) and/or Hogan Lovells.\n9  \n(b) In the Avonwick  proceedings he gave evidence on the Ukrainian law \nof limitation to the effect that a claimant could delay the start of the \nlimitation period indefinitely by re fraining from making a demand on \nthe defendant. That was firmly rejected by Picken J;10 and in cross-\n \n9  See Beketov8/9-10 {C1/1/4} and his correction sheet at [11] {C9.14/1/2}  \n10   Avonwick  {M3/4/158-159} at [745] (“ Mr Beketov had no real answer when it was put to him that his \nposition ran counter to the limitation rationale ”); [748] (“ I put this point to Mr Beketov but did not \nreceive a principled explanation as to why it is not right ”) \nAA3/3/9\n7 \n examination at this trial Mr Beketov accepted that it was “ wholly \ncontrary to…the pur pose of limitation ” and “ absurd ”.11 \n(c) In his first report in these proceedi ngs, made in support of the Bank’s \napplication for a worldwide freezing order and in full knowledge of the \nduty of full and frank disclosure,12 Mr Beketov gave seriously \nmisleading evidence in relation to the attribution of knowledge to the Bank for the purposes of limitation. His statement that “ it is the \nknowledge of the management body w ith the authority to bring a claim \non behalf of the company that matters ”\n13 contradicted both the evidence \nhe later gave regarding attr ibution of knowledge in the Avonwick  \ncase,14 and his oral evidence at this trial, where he accepted that the \nknowledge of other employees of th e Bank was also capable of being \nattributed to it.15  \n(d) As will be demonstrated below, in the course of his oral evidence he \nexpressed views on critical point s in the case which directly \ncontradicted the opinions that had be en expressed in his written reports \nand which had plainly been contrive d (probably not by Mr Beketov) to \nsupport the Bank’s misconceived case.  \n(4) Mr Marchukov was called by D2 and Mr Nahnybida by D3-D8.

THE STARTING POINT  \n In order to secure jurisdic tion in England, the Bank n eeded to identify claims \nagainst anchor defendants who could be  sued in England as of right.  \n Since 7 November 2014 when the allegations were first published in Glavcom, a \npopular news outlet in Ukraine, it had been widely reported in th e press in Ukraine \nthat money had been siphoned from the Bank to six overseas companies (D3-D8) \n(the “Glavcom Article ”). The Glavcom Article was no doubt based on inside \ninformation obtained by the journalists fr om a senior person within the Bank who \nwill have obtained that information somewhat earlier in October 2014. In these submissions, that person is referred to as the “ Whistleblower ”. In the Glavcom \nArticle, it was suggested that it seemed un likely that the Borrowers would be able \nto secure repayment of the money as th e supply agreements were fake, the only \nsecurity for the loans was pledges of th e borrowers’ contract ual rights to goods \nunder those fake supply agreements and was worthless. It was suggested that D1 \nstood to benefit from the alleged misa ppropriation of the Bank’s money as the \nsuppliers and the borrowers were re lated to the owners of the Bank.\n17  \n These allegations (the “Supply Agreement Fraud Allegations ”) are the subject of \nthe claims the Bank chose to make in Engl and. Three of the foreign suppliers (D3-\nD5) were English companies and the Eng lish court would have  jurisdiction over \nthem. As explained below, the Bank was caref ul to ensure that the claims advanced \nagainst D1 and D2 went no further than the claims against D3-D8. \n \nor partly). It means that after repayment of the Relevant Loans no claim for compensation for harm \nmay be brought against the Borrowers or the Corporate Defendants ”; and Nahnybida3/232 \n{C4/1/42}  (agreeing with Mr Alyoshin’s evidence relating to limitation).  \n17  For a detailed account of the allegations published in the Glavcom on 7 November 2014 (the \n“Glavcom Article ”), see Section F6(2)(b)  below  \nAA3/3/11\n9 \n C1(1)  The unjust enrichment claims against D3-D8 \n It was readily apparent from the Bank’s records that D3-D8 had received \nprepayments under various supply agreem ents in the total amount of USD \n1,911,877,365 which had not been returned (the “ Unreturned Prepayments ” or \n“URPP ”).  \n While the Bank did not itself pay money to D3-D8, the Bank claims they were \nenriched through receipt of the URPP from the Borrowers at the Bank’s expense as there was “ a factual connection … between [the  Bank’s] loss of property and the \nenrichment ”.\n18  \n The Bank knew that D3-D8 had not kept the money.

The claims against them were the hook upon which the Bank had a chance of establishing English jurisdiction over claims against D1 and D2. \nC1(2)  Matching the unjust enrichment cl aim to the Misappropriation claim \n Driven by the need to establish that the claims against D1 and D2 were “ so closely \nconnected ” with the claims against the Englis h Suppliers in order to establish \nEnglish jurisdiction over any claims agains t D1 and D2, the Bank chose to limit its \nclaim against them so that it matched the claim against D3 – D8: \n(1) The Bank claims that “ Messrs Kolomoisky and Bogolyubov, using their \ncontrol over the Bank, the Borrowers and the Defendant Suppliers, procured \nthe misappropriation of $1,911,877,385 from the Bank. ”19 through “ the grant \n \n18  PoC/44 {A1/2/26}  \n19  Original PoC/50 {A1/1.1/22}  \nAA3/3/12\n10 \n of purported loans to the Borrowers, who had no credit or trading history \nand no prospect of repaying c. $1.9 billion ”.20 \n(2) The claim in tort is also brought agai nst D3-D8 on the basis that they are \nalleged to have “ procured and/or assisted in the misappropriation of \n$1,911,877,385 ”.21 \n(3) Original PoC/54(b) and (c) refe rred to D3-D8 receiving the funds \nmisappropriated from the Bank.22 However, consistently with the Bank \nrecognising that D3-D8 did not always receive the same funds as are alleged to have been misappropriated, this pl eading was amended to refer to D3-D8 \nreceiving the URPPs.\n23 \n(4) The Bank later identified 270 “ Relevant Drawdowns ”, a portion of which \n“caused” the URPPs.24  \n Hence, the same advances of funds to Borrowers which are identified as “ expenses ” \nof the Bank for the purpose of its unjust en richment claim against D3-D8 are also \nidentified as the misappropriations whic h caused the Bank loss for the purpose of \nits claim in tort. \n Despite the clear and express wording of the Particulars of Claim which alleges a \nmisappropriation in the amount of USD 1, 911,877,385, the Bank asserts in its Reply \nthat it always claimed that USD 2,335, 943,519 had been misappropriated. That is \nsimply wrong and, contrary to the position adopted in the Bank’s Closing,25 the fact \nthat the Reply makes comments to that effect does not resolve the “ pleading issue ”. \nThe Bank has never sought to ame nd its Particulars of Claim.  \n \n20  PoC/52(1)(iv) {A1/2/30}  \n21  PoC/54 {A1/2/31}  \n22  Original PoC/54(c) {A1/1.1/24}  \n23  PoC/54(c) {A1/2/32}  \n24  PoC/16 {A1/2/7}  \n25  Bank.Closing/774 {AA2/15/392}  \nAA3/3/13\n11 \n C1(3)  Identification of the Relevant Dr awdowns (the Bank’s Methodology) \n When it originally filed its Particulars of Claims the Bank only identified Relevant \nLoans under which drawdowns had been ma de.

These were easy to identify from the Transaction Data. \n(2) Mr Thompson acknowledged that the URPPs were the “ source ” from which \nhe did his work.\n28 There were many more drawdowns than those that have \nbeen identified as relevant so it wo uld have been impossible to identify the \nrelevant ones without starting fr om the URPP. As he put it, “ you would have \nto work back from them to find your relevant drawdowns ”.29 \n The Relevant Drawdowns fall into two broad categories: \n(1) Relevant Drawdowns which directly funded a URPP.  \n \n26  Davidson1/2.1.i {D2/1/8}  \n27  Further Information provided by the Bank on 22 May 2020 {A2/9/3}  \n28  Thompson {Day23/26:9-18}  \n29  Thompson {Day23/28:1-7}  \nAA3/3/14\n12 \n In some cases funds can be followed directly from the Bank to a Borrower \nand on to a Defendant Supplier as a URPP (this was demonstrated at trial by \nreference to the example of Uniks.30) \n(2) Relevant Drawdowns which “ indirectly funded ” a URPP:  \n(a) The funds from most Relevant Dr awdowns could not be followed \ndirectly from the Bank to a Defendant Supplier. However, the Bank developed a bespoke methodology (the “ Bank’s Methodology ”) which \nfollows some funds directly but also makes “ Links by Transaction \nReference ” connecting Prepayments and Returns of Prepayment under \nthe same Supply Agreement Referen ce number many months apart (this \nwas demonstrated at trial by refe rence to the example of Tseris\n31).  \n(b) Using the Bank’s Methodology, some  URPP could not be linked to \noriginal advances of funds by the Bank to any one of the Original 46 Ukrainian Borrowers who had made the URPP. In these cases, the Bank’s Methodology was modified so as  to identify orig inal advances \nof funds by the Bank to four Additio nal Borrowers (the three Cypriot \nBorrowers and another Ukrainian Bo rrower, Prominmet) who had then \nprovided funds to one of the Origin al 46 Ukrainian Borrowers which \nwere then linked to URPP using the Bank’s Methodology.\n32  \n There was still a mismatch between th e aggregate amount of the 270 Relevant \nDrawdowns (USD 2,335,943,519) and the amoun t of the funds which it was alleged \nthat D1 and D2 had misappropriated (U SD 1,911,877,385) and was alleged to be \nthe expense to the Bank through which D3-D8 had been enriched.  \n Despite what the Bank now claims, it has not  (and never has) a dvanced a claim to \nloss caused by the whole of the Relevant Drawdowns. It is clear from the very \n \n30  See D1’s Uniks handout {AA6/4}  \n31  See D1’s Tseris handout  {AA6/5}  \n32  The amendments to the Particulars of Claim intr oduced in July 2020 to identify these Relevant \nDrawdowns involved entirely new allegations of misappropriation as explained in the context of the \nLimitation Defence, in Section F10  below. \nAA3/3/15\n13 \n definition of “ Relevant Drawdowns ”33 provided by the Bank that of these \ndrawdowns only “ a portion ” is alleged to have caused  the URPPs.

These are the \n“Relevant Drawdown Portions ”, i.e. the portions of Relevant Drawdowns which \nare alleged to have “ caused ” or “ funded ” the URPP.  \n They are identified in Column L of the Spreadsheet at Appendix 5-1-1-1 of Mr \nThompson’s Third Report. 37 \n The total amount of the Relevant Drawdown Portions is precisely the same as the \ntotal amount of the URPPs. \n \n33  See the original definition of “Relevant Draw down” in the Bank’s response to a Request for \nInformation made by D1 provided by the Bank on 22 May 2020 {A2/9/3} ; see also PoC/16 {A1/2/7} \nand PoC/58A {A12/2/33}  \n34  Thompson, {Day23/14:11-16}  \n35  See Thompson2, Appendix 3-1 “ Worked example of the nexus between the Relevant Drawdowns \nand the Unreturned Prepayments for AEF including the effect on the calculation of loss”  {D1/351}  \n36  See Appendix 5-1-1 – Allocation of Relevant Drawdowns {D1/452}  \n37  See Column “L” in the Spread sheet at Appendix 5-1-1-1 (Summary of allocation of Relevant \nDrawdowns) which is headed “Amount allocated  to Unreturned Prepayments (i.e. Thompson \nRelevant Drawdown Portion) \nAA3/3/16\n14 \n C2. THE BANK’S CASE ON LOSS FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE TORT CLAIM  \nC2(1)  Irrelevance of the URPP \n It is common ground (at least be tween the Forensic Accountants38) that the making \nof an URPP by a Borrower to a Defendant Supplier did not of itself cause the Bank \na loss. The amount of the URPP is simply the amount which the Bank claims was misappropriated. \n Whether the Bank’s Methodology establishes a causative link between a Relevant \nDrawdown and a URPP sufficient for the purposes of its claim in Unjust \nEnrichment is a matter in issue between the Bank and D3-D8.39 As for the claim in \ntort against D1 and D2, the Bank has stre ssed (and it is common ground) that it is \nnot essential to its cause of action against D1 and D2 for it to show that the sums \nalleged to have been misappropriated in fact “ caused ” or “ funded ” a URPP.40  \n So far as the claim against D1 is con cerned, the Bank’s Me thodology serves only \none useful purpose, and that is to identif y the particular advances of funds by the \nBank which the Bank alleges caused it a loss in respect of which the Bank believed \nit could bring a claim in England. \nC2(2)  The careful confinement of the claim to the RDPs  \n The Bank has expressly confirmed that it  makes no claim that any lending other \nthan through the Relevant Drawdowns caused it a loss for the purpose of these proceedings.  \n \n38  FAJS2/6.4 {D4/2/17}  “Mr Steadman and Mr Thompson agree that Unreturned Prepayments are \nneither assets nor liabilities of the Bank and cannot in themselves give rise to an accounting loss to \nthe Bank. In Mr Davidson’s view, it is additionally the case that the Unreturned Prepayments were not transactions to which the bank was party and so do not give rise to a loss, accounting or \notherwise. ” \n39  The premise of the Bank’s claim in Unjust Enrich ment as a matter of Ukrainian Law is that it was \nsuf"}

This proposition is false as a matter of Ukrainian Law, but since no claim is advanced \nagainst D1 (or D2) in Unjust Enrichment, this is  a matter which will be addressed by D3-D8 in its \nsubmissions. \n40  Reply/35.1 {A1/25/65}  \nAA3/3/17\n15 \n (1) D1 made the following request for information in April 2020: \n“൭. Please confirm that it is the Claimant ’s case that no corporate lending to \ncompanies alleged to have been owned or controlled by D ൫ or D൬ other than the \nRelevant Loans caused the Claimant an y loss and, if so, explain why the \nRelevant Loans and no other such lendi ng is alleged to have caused it loss.” \n(2) The Bank responded as follows:  \n“… The Bank’s case in these proceedings is  in respect of the loss caused to the \nBank in respect of the Relevant Drawdowns. The Bank’s rights to claim in respect of other losses arising from other lending are strictly reserved.”\n41 \n As explained above, the Bank carefully and deliberately confined its claim to the \nmisappropriation of the RDPs (“ portions ” of the Relevant Dr awdowns) in the total \nsum of USD 1,911,877,385 so as to match the claim in tort against D1 and D2 to the claim in unjust enrichment (and tort ) against D3-D8 in the same amount, in \norder to maximise its chances of obtaining English jurisdiction.  \n THE REPAYMENT DEFENCE \nD1. INTRODUCTION  \n There is no dispute that (with just tw o exceptions) the Relevant Drawdowns are \nrecorded in the Bank’s books as having been repaid. \n It is common ground that there were three di rect sources of the funds used to effect \nthe repayments:42 \n \n41  See Response to Request 3 in paragraph 2 of the Bank’s response to a Request for Information made \nby D1 provided by the Bank on 22 May 2020 {A2/9/6}  \n42  Identifying the direct source of funds is wholly irrelevant if D1’s Repayment Defence is accepted in \nfull. If and insofar as it becomes necessary, the mean s by which even the direct source of funds for \nrepayments should be identified is not agreed between the parties. The Bank insists that its own \nMethodology should be used, when in fact it is w holly inapt and irrelevant to the exercise. This is \naddressed in Section C of the Quantum Annex {AA3/4/20} . \nAA3/3/18\n16 \n (1) “Cash” (Intermediary Loans). Intermed iary Loans were loans from which \ndrawdowns were used to repay Relevant Drawdowns as part of a continuation \nof Loan Recycling.43  \n(2) Asset Transfer. When the NBU realised that the Bank had in adequate capital \nand a portfolio of bad loans that ha d accumulated as a result of the Bank \nadvancing new loans to service and repay existing loans, it required D1 and D2, as the Bank’s Shareholders, to take  steps to improve the Bank’s capital \nposition. Part of that exercise involve d the creation of mortgages securing \nrepayment of various loans (includi ng Relevant Loans and Intermediary \nLoans) and the enforcement of those mort gages to transfer assets to the Bank \nin return for repayments. The valuation of the assets by approved valuers was subject to scrutiny by the NBU. \n(3) New Loans. Towards the end of 2016, 36 New Loans were issued to “ New \nBorrowers ” and the funds advanced were used  to repay loans to 193 existing \ncorporate borrowers which were shell companies with no independent means \nof servicing or repaying their loans (the “ 193 Borrowers ”).

Some of the loans \nrepaid were Relevant and Intermediary Loans. \n The Bank contends that the repayments, or  apparent repayments, of the Relevant \nLoans are irrelevant and shoul d be ignored when assessing its loss. For most of the \nproceedings, the Bank advanced this argument by reference to an alleged principle of Ukrainian law whereby “ a purported repayment of a Relevant Loan can be \ndisregarded if the repayment was made w ith funds derived from another fraudulent \nloan”.\n44  \n The tactic of relying on assert ions as to foreign law can carry a litigant quite far in \ninterlocutory proceedings, because until tr ial the courts cannot test whether the \nalleged legal principle truly exists, but must nevertheless give it weight. \n \n43  Confusingly, some of the loan facilities identified as Intermediary Loans were also Relevant Loans. \nIn such a case, all this means is that drawdowns under a Relevant Loan (which were not Relevant Drawdowns) were used to repay Relevant Drawdowns. \n44  [2020] Ch 783 at [230] { A5/12/60 }, referring to Beketov5/15 {H1/26.1/6}  \nAA3/3/19\n17 \n Accordingly, the Court of Appeal accepted that the Bank had a “ good arguable \ncase” that the Repayment Defence was wrong as a matter of Ukrainian law, albeit \nit noted that “ Come trial, the defendants may succeed on the point ”.45 \n At the trial, the Bank’s tactic has been e xposed. Its case as to Ukrainian law rested \nsolely on a few short paragraphs in the evidence of Mr Beketov46 which were \nalways deeply suspect and unsatisfactor y, being unsupported by any authority, or \ndetailed reasoning, and riddled with inconsistencies and non sequiturs . Some of \nthese problems were laid bare in D1’s Written Opening.47 In the end, however, it \nwas unnecessary to explore them in detail with Mr Beketov since in the course of his cross-examination he made a series of concessions which departed radically \nfrom his written evidence and clearly c onfirmed that the alleged principle of \nUkrainian law on which the Bank had relied does not exist.  \n The Bank has therefore been reduced to contending, in its Closing, that the \nexistence of loss is really a factual matter th at is not susceptible to legal analysis at \nall, and that as a matter of fact its lo ss has not been reduced  by the repayments.48 \nThis is a remarkable volte face – one can only wonder how  the Court of Appeal \nwould have responded to such an argument  – but in any event it is wrong. While \nthe existence of loss in a given case may ultimately be a question of fact, the basic question as to whether a repayment of a borrower’s liability in respect of an unlawful loan using funds derived from a further unlawful loan extinguishes any \ntortious loss in respect of the first loan is one which admits of a general answer and \nis properly characterised as a question of law. Consistently with that, the Bank has \nexpressly (and correctly) trea ted the question as one of Ukrainian law, and relied \non alleged principles of Uk rainian law which have no c ounterpart in English law, \nincluding in its submissions be fore the Court of Appeal.   \n \n45  [2020] Ch 783 at [233]-[234] { A5/12/61 } \n46  Beketov8/137-141 {C1/1/44} , Beketov9/200(a)-(b) {C6/1/82} \n47  D1.Opening/125, 129 {AA3/1/40} .

If the Relevant Loans were valid, the Borrowers had a contractual liability to repay the Relevant Loans which was automatically discharged by operation of law. If the Relevant Loans were \nvoid, the Borrowers had a restitutionary liability to repay which was discharged as a result of the Bank’s choice to treat the Borrowers as having \nrepaid everything that they owed.  \n(4) In either case the or igin of the funds is irrelevant . If the funds were illicitly \nobtained then the Bank would have a cl aim in respect of that separate \nwrongdoing but it does not affect the fact that the Borrowers’ liabilities have \nbeen discharged. Indeed this now seems to be common ground.  \n(5) The fact that the funds  advanced under Relevant  Drawdowns have been \nreturned to the Bank not only means th at the Borrowers no longer have any \nliabilities in respect of the Relevant  Drawdowns, but also means that any \ntortious loss arising from the Rele vant Drawdowns has been extinguished. \nThis is not because the Borrowers’ li abilities and the tortious loss are \nnecessarily co-extensive in all circumstances: the Bank’s attempted analogies based on a hypothetical settlement agr eement or a novation (neither of which \ninvolves repayment) are therefore miscon ceived and irrelevant. It is because \nthe Borrowers’ obligation to repay the Relevant Drawdowns has been fully \nperformed, and in those circumstances  the tortious loss arising from the \nAA3/3/21\n19 \n Relevant Drawdowns (as opposed to any separate wrongdoing) has been \nextinguished.  \n(6) The core fallacy in the Bank’s position is  that, in contending that its loss has \nnot been extinguished, it is necessarily referring not to the loss arising from the Relevant Drawdowns but to its overall or net loss arising from a series of \ntorts. However, its claim is expressly not for its overall or net loss but only \nfor the loss of the Relevant Drawdown s. That loss has b een extinguished by \nthe repayment of the Relevant Loans,  even if the circumstances of the \nrepayment were themselves tortious and caused the Bank a further loss which \nis not the subject of the claim. \n(7) The Bank was, at one time, less sheepish about admitting this. Thus before \nthe Court of Appeal Mr Hunter KC e xpressly submitted that the repayments \nstood to be ignored as a matte r of Ukrainian law because:  \n“the purported repayment…is, in substance,  illusory. It doesn’t reduce or eliminate \nthe Bank’s overall loss . It would just shift it, just the label of it, from loan 1 to loan \n2, potentially. Or, if you put it another way, if you regard the two loans as being \ncoordinated, the overall effect is to cause a $100 million loss .”49 \n(8) The Bank also gives the game aw ay in its Closing Submissions50 where it \ncontends that, if a claimant suffers ten misappropr"}

Or, if you put it another way, if you regard the two loans as being \ncoordinated, the overall effect is to cause a $100 million loss .”49 \n(8) The Bank also gives the game aw ay in its Closing Submissions50 where it \ncontends that, if a claimant suffers ten misappropriations of $10, and three \nfurther misappropriations of $10 which are used to compensate the first three \nthefts, “ the claimant’s overall loss  remains $100 ”. That is correct but it does \nnot meet the point that, if a claim is brought which does not encompass the \noverall loss but is specifically limited to the first three misappropriations, then it will fail because the latter loss has been extinguished. \n(9) Another leitmotif  of the Bank’s submissions is that the Relevant Drawdowns \nwere not repaid but only “ recorded in the Bank’s  books as having been \nrepaid ” or “ purportedly repaid ”. If by this the Bank means that no money \nwas returned to the Bank, that is wrong:  money was returned to the Bank and \nused to discharge the Borrowers’ obligati ons, even if the source of that money \n \n49  Day2/76:9-77:23 { G3/20/20 } \n50  Bank.Closing/773(2) {AA2/15/392}  \nAA3/3/22\n20 \n was another unlawful loan (or an asset to which the Bank ascribed too high a \nvalue). The Bank’s books are at least eviden ce of that fact and there has been \nno suggestion that the books are inaccura te, let alone any attempt to rewrite \nthem. On the other hand, if the Bank means that any payments were not strictly repayments of lo ans because the Relevant Lo ans were void, that is a \ntechnical point of no signif icance since, even if it is correct, the Bank in any \nevent chose to accept the payments as effecting the return of the Relevant \nDrawdowns, and in those circumstances cannot make a claim in respect of \nthe Relevant Drawdowns in tort.  \n In developing these submissions, we will fi rst identify the critical parts of Mr \nBeketov’s evidence and the concessions he made (and in doing so will address the – hopeless – suggestion by the Bank that hi s concessions were somehow unintended \nor the product of confusion). We will then apply Ukrainian law as Mr Beketov confirmed it to be to the facts.

Yes, I believe that is possible.  \n The following day, after being referred to the above evidence, he confirmed his \nposition yet again:53 \nYou'll remember yesterday we were disc ussing the situation where an unlawfully \nobtained loan is repaid using the proceed s of another unlawfully obtained loan. \nA.  Yes. \n \n51  Beketov {Day27/110:21} - {Day27/111:14}  \n52  Beketov { Day27/111:20 } - {Day27/112:7 } \n53  Beketov {Day28/17:2} - {Day28/19:5}  \nAA3/3/24\n22 \n Q.  And you remember -- if we just have a look at it, if we could go to Day 27, page \n111, at line 1, {Day27/111:1} -- we see the position that we agreed: \"Now, taking \nthe first loan, if that was a valid loan and a payment is made in respect of the borrower's liability, as I understand it, you say the borrower's liability is extinguished; correct?\" And you said \"Yes\". So what we've agreed is that, if the loan \nbeing repaid was valid, then repayment of that loan extinguishes the liability of the \nborrower; correct? \nA.  Correct. \nQ.  And then what we also went on to discu ss on this page in the next bit at line 6, \n{Day27/111:6}: \"And do you also say, because the borrower's liability is extinguished, in other words he has repaid his money, then the wrongdoers who \narranged the loan to that borrower, they al so have extinguished their liability because \nthe borrower's liability has been extinguished and so there is no further loss that the \nbank suffers; is that right? \"Answer:  I thin k on propositions that the first loan is \nvalid, it is right.\" So what we also agree is that, if the borrower's liability in respect \nof a valid loan is repaid and is extinguished , then any liability of third parties in tort \nin relation to that loan is also extinguished; correct? \nA.  I took it not as liability of third pa rties. I saw it as liability of borrower, \nparticular counterparty, because, as far as I said, that liability would be \nextinguished also because such counterpar ty to valid loan would not be able to \nmake a tort claim. \nQ.  Well, wait a minute. Just look at the question you were agreeing with.  Line 6: \n\"And do you also say, because the borrower's liability is extinguished, in other words \nhe has repaid his money, then the wr ongdoers who arranged the loan to that \nborrower, they also have extinguished th eir liability because the borrower's liability \nhas been extinguished and so there is no further loss that the bank suffers ...\" And \nyou agreed; correct? \nA.  I think in that respect it may be agreed that, you know, there was no further \nloan -- loss that the bank suffered and in this respect, yes, even though the bank \nwould have ability to file a tort claim against third parties, but their liability \nwould be extinguished by repayment of this valid loan. \nQ.

Exactly.  That's what I thought.    \n In light of Mr Beketov’s unambiguous evidence when cross-examined, the Bank \ncannot possibly maintain a submission that th e liability of the Bo rrower in contract \nis somehow to be distinguished from its loss caused by D1’s alleged tort in procuring the Relevant Drawdown. The repayment of the loan indisputably \nextinguishes both the Borrower’s liability in contract and the harm caused by the \nloss of the loan monies whic h would otherwise be recovera ble from third parties in \ntort.  \nAA3/3/25\n23 \n D2(1)(b)  Where the Relevant Loans are void \n The effect of the repayments is not signif icantly different on the alternative premise \nthat the Loans are void rather than valid.  \n The key distinction between thes e scenarios is the following:  \n(1) With a valid loan, the borrower has a contractual liability to repay the loan \nunder Article 1049(1) of the Civil Code . That liability is automatically \nextinguished when a payment is ma de into the Borro wer’s account, by \noperation of Article 1049(3 ) of the Civil Code.54 \n(2) With a void loan, the borrower has a restitutionary liability to return the \namount of the loan, under Artic le 216 of the Civil Code.55 Such a liability is \nnot automatically extinguished by a repayment: instead the creditor can \nchoose whether to account for the payment as a discharge of the restitutionary liability, or of some other liability. It is a question of fact what choice the \ncreditor has made. \n Crucially, however, void loans are no different from valid loans in the sense that, if \nthe loan monies are repaid and the liability of the borrower is discharged, then any \ntortious loss is also extinguished.  \n (To deal with a straw man erected by the Bank in its Closing, this is not because the \ntortious loss is necessarily  coextensive with the amount of the borrower’s liability \nin all circumstances:56 the Bank’s “ settlement ”57 and “ novation ”58 examples are \ntherefore nothing to the point. It is rather  because the extent of the tortious loss \narising from the loan is the same as the am ount of the loan itself, so if the Borrower \nrepays the loan (or a sum equivalent to th e loan) then the loss has been extinguished \nin full and there is no longer anything to claim from the tortfeasor. By contrast in \n \n54  The Ukrainian Civil Code {C2/8/11}  \n55  The Ukrainian Civil Code {C1/6/6} \n56  cf Bank.Closing/792 {AA2/15/403} \n57  Bank.Closing/800 {AA2/15/407} \n58  Alyoshin {Day31/116:1-25} \nAA3/3/26\n24 \n the “novation ” scenario the loan is not repaid but simply transferred from one debtor \nto another, so the original loss still subsists after the novation. As for the \n“settlement ” scenario, the effect of the English authorities discussed at \nBank.Closing/78159 is that it is a question of construction of the settlement \nagreement whether it “ should be taken to fix the full measure of [the creditor’s] \nloss”.60 That explains why a tortfeasor would (or would be very likely to) remain \nliable in the scenario posited at Bank.Closing/800.61 But where a loan (or a sum \nequivalent to the loan, if it is void) is repa id to the lender in full then there can be \nno question that the tortious loss has been extinguished.) \n Again, the above analysis was full y accepted by Mr Beketov in his cross-\nexamination. \n First, Mr Beketov agreed that if the borrower makes restitution in the amount of the \npurported loan, its liabi lity is extinguished:62  \nMR HOWARD: […] If the borrower makes restitution under Article 216(1), leaving \naside a case where there might be a clai m for some additional d"}

In a narrow sense, if we’re dealing on ly with void transaction and obligations \nbetween party A and party B to this transaction, under Ukrainian law, as a matter of principle, it is extinguished. \nQ. Yes. Mr Beketov, any other answer w ould be ridiculous. If I take money from \nyou improperly, I take $1 million from you, I’ m liable to return it in restitution. If I \ngive it back to you, then my liability will be extinguished. \nA. As I said, in this narrow specific case, yes. \nQ. Yes, well, in any case. If I return the money that I took from you, my liability to \nreturn it is extinguished; “Yes” or “No”? \nA. It is extinguished, yes. \n \n59  Bank.Closing/781 {AA2/15/397}  \n60  Heaton v AXA [2002] 2 AC 329 at [9] {M1/8.5/9} \n61  Bank.Closing/800 {AA2/15/407}  \n62  Beketov {Day28/22:5-24}  \nAA3/3/27\n25 \n \n Counsel then put to Mr Beketov that, if the borrower’s liability was extinguished, \nso too was any tortious loss arising from the loan. Mr Beketov initially resisted that \nproposition63 on the (correct) basis that the tor tious loss might theoretically exceed \nthe amount of the loan – for example if th e claimant had also suffered lost profit \nover and above the loss of the loan monies themselves. But, when asked to ignore \nthat theoretical possibility, he agreed that the tortious  loss would be extinguished:64 \nSo insofar as you haven’t suffered a loss of profit and you haven’t incurred expenses \n-- okay? Let’s leave that on one side for th e moment -- your only loss is that I took \na million from you and now you have a million back. In that situation, there would be -- the liability in restitution has been disch arged and the claim in tort against [the \ntortfeasor] who procured this would also  be extinguished because you would have \nno further loss that you could claim against [the tortfeasor]; correct? \nA. The claim would not be extinguish ed but the loss under the claim may be \nextinguished. \nQ. Not “may be”, “would be”? \nA. Would be.  \n However, in response to counsel’s next que stion, Mr Beketov appeared to change \nhis position. He said that the loss woul d only be extinguished if the borrower’s \nliability was not discharged using the “ victim’s own resources ”,65 and suggested \nthat he had given his answer on the assumption that “ the money repaid in restitution \nwere taken from proper sources but not from the victim’s own resources ”.66 \n Following a discussion as to whether Mr Beketov could truly have been under any \nmisapprehension in this regard, the Cour t indicated that counsel should go back \nover the ground so that Mr Beke tov could explain his position “ with clarity ”.67  \n Mr Beketov then did so. First, he confirmed that a creditor in respect of two \nrestitutionary obligations arising from void loans is entitled to choose whether to \nallocate a payment to the first loan or the second loan:68  \n \n63  Beketov {Day28/24:6-12}  \n64  Beketov {Day28/25:13-25} \n65  Beketov {Day28/25:18-19} \n66  Beketov {Day28/26:9-13} \n67  Beketov {Day28/36:6-13} \n68  Beketov {Day28/38:35} - {Day28/39:14}  \nAA3/3/28\n26 \n […] So you have void loan -- I’m calling them “loans” but they’re void -- okay? -- \nbut it’s just easier to call it “loan”. So you’ve got loan A for $1 million and loan B \nfor $1 million. Now, a payment is made to the bank of $1 million, so two lots of 1 million have gone out, 1 million comes back "}
{"start": 59500, "text": "eketov {Day28/24:6-12}  \n64  Beketov {Day28/25:13-25} \n65  Beketov {Day28/25:18-19} \n66  Beketov {Day28/26:9-13} \n67  Beketov {Day28/36:6-13} \n68  Beketov {Day28/38:35} - {Day28/39:14}  \nAA3/3/28\n26 \n […] So you have void loan -- I’m calling them “loans” but they’re void -- okay? -- \nbut it’s just easier to call it “loan”. So you’ve got loan A for $1 million and loan B \nfor $1 million. Now, a payment is made to the bank of $1 million, so two lots of 1 million have gone out, 1 million comes back . Now, is this how I should understand \nyour evidence? The bank is entitled to choose whether to treat that $1 million that has come back as repaying the restitutionary liability that arose in respect of loan A \nor the restitutionary liability that arose in respect of loan B? \nA. Yes. \nQ. It’s for the bank to make the choice? \nA. Yes. \n Mr Beketov then confirmed that, if the creditor chooses to tr eat a repayment as \ndischarging a particular rest itutionary liability, any tortious loss in respect of the \ncorresponding void loan is  similarly extinguished:69  \nQ. Right. Good. Now, assume that the tortfeasor in my example, wrongdoer -- you \nknow what “tortfeasor” means; yes? -- comes along and says, “Here is $1 million \nand I’m paying off the liability in respect of loan A”, so he says that. Assume that the bank says, “Thank you very much, Mr Tortfeasor”, and credits the receipt to loan A and treats itself as having received full restitution in respect of loan A; okay? \nA. Okay. \nQ. Now, if that happens as a matter of fact, that the bank says, “Thank you, Mr \nTortfeasor, I’ll take that 1 million and I’ m going to credit it against loan A”, having \ndone that, if the bank does that, at that stage, having credited loan A, do you agree that the bank would no longer have any out standing claim in restitution in respect of \nloan A because it’s received 1 million and it’s credited it to loan A?  \nA. If as a matter of fact, as you said, this would be position of, let’s say, \nhypothetical bank have to treat repayment  of this liability, I would say it may \nbe again as a matter of fact in particular case said that in this case the bank made a decision how to discharge this liability. \nQ. Yes, great. I think that’s very helpful. That’s what I thought and we’re largely \nagreed. So, of course, in that  scenario, the bank having said, “Thank you, I will take \nthis money for loan A”, it still has its cause of action pursuant to Article 216 and in \ntort relating to loan B; correct? \nA. Yes, because it still suffers loss. \nQ. Yes, but on loan A, if the bank does this, if it says, “Yes, I’m taking this money \nand applying it to loan A”, in that situati on, it no longer has any rights to restitution \nin respect of loan A because it’s recovere d the restitution and it would no longer \nhave any claim in tort for procuring loan  A because it doesn’t any longer have a loss \nin respect of loan A; correct? \n \n69  Beketov {Day28/39:15} - {Day28/42:22}  \nAA3/3/29\n27 \n A. Again, Mr Howard, if it may be taken as a true fact that in such way bank \ndecided that it has to be compensated, in  other words that the bank is fine that \nit is repaid with its own money for this tort and there is evidence that that in fact happened, there was the will of the ba nk to do so, then I believe any lender \nin such situation would have difficulty to claim this loss. I’m saying that the bank would have difficulty to claim such loss. \nQ. Yes, exactly, exactly. \nA. But it’s a matter of fact – \nMR JUSTICE TROWER: Just pausing there,  I think the answer -- the question and \nthe answer rolled up the restitutionary elem ent and the tort element. I’d like the \nanswer separately in relation to those. \nMR HOWARD: Yes, okay. Let’s break it out. Once the bank -- we’re looking at a \nhypothetical, but it’s a factual question.

That ’s I think what you’re saying. But on a \nhypothetical factual question, situation, the bank takes 1 million from Mr Tortfeasor, “Thank you very much”, credits it to loan A,  in that situation the right to get any \nrestitution has been extinguished -- co rrect? -- in respect of loan A? \nA. In restitution if -- in restitution, yes . \nQ. And insofar as there is a claim in tort  against anyone who procured loan A, at \nleast insofar as the -- well, insofar as the ba nk’s damage is the loss of the money, \nbecause it has received the money back a nd it has accepted the money as in respect \nof loan A, the bank no longer has any torti ous loss to claim against the tortfeasor, \ndoes it? […] \nA. […] if the bank claims only one item, from what you’re saying, thinks of what \nhe has been deprived of, not lost profits, not expense, then -- and it is -- as I said, \nit is the way how the bank decides that it  should be remedied, then it’s hard to \nsay that -- as a matter of fact again, that the bank was not remedied in restitution. \nQ. Yes, but -- sorry, I think we got confused. The purpose of the question, the \npurpose of his Lordship’s – \nA. Okay, that it was limited in tort, yes. \n Accordingly, if the Loans are void then the essential question is whether the Bank \nhas made a choice to treat the Relevant Loan s as repaid. That is  a question of fact, \nas Mr Beketov also confirmed:70  \nQ. […] I think you would also agree, wouldn’t you, that it’s a question of fact as to \nwhether the creditor or the bank here made a choice? That’s right, isn’t it? \nA. It’s definitely not a question for Ukrainian law expert. \n \n70  Beketov {Day28/44:7-16}  \nAA3/3/30\n28 \n Q. No, it’s a question of fact. But I think what you would agree is it’s a question of \nfact whether the bank, whether via its old management or via its new management, \nhad made such a choice. That’s the questi on of fact that the court would have to \ndetermine? \nA. It’s a question of fact, I agree. \n Finally, Mr Beketov again rep eated his evidence that, if the creditor makes a choice \nto accept a repayment as discharging the li ability of a borrower in respect of the \nearlier of two void loans, it cannot later ma ke a claim in tort against a third party \nwho procured the void loan:71  \nQ. If the facts show that the creditor has in fact made its choice, so it has chosen in \nfact that, on my example, the $1 million that came in should be treated as crediting against the liability of borrower A for instan ce -- if it does that, it can’t then ignore \nthat and say, “Well, actually, although I credited borrower A’s liability, I now want \nto sue the tortfeasor in resp ect of loan A”, because it’s too late, isn’t it? Once you’ve \nmade that choice, any loss in respect  of loan A has been extinguished? \nA. Mr Howard, I believe it’s a matter of fact to decide, but, you know, as we \ndiscussed before, if the borrower A made it  explicit that it was his intention to \ntreat repayment for the fraudulent loan A in such way, I believe it would be difficult for him to sue for the same loan  in the court, if he accepts on some \nfactual patterns that this is actually disch arge of his claim in tort which he had. \nQ. The bank -- you mean if the bank has done that, so if the bank has treated the \npayment as discharging the liability of a borrowe r in respect of loan A, he couldn’t \nthen come along and either sue that borrower in respect of loan A or sue a party who \nprocured it, claiming the loss, because there is no loss; correct? \nA. Again, you know, if you please be  more clear what you refer to the loss \nbecause, you know, I said we have three items of loss. \nQ. Yes, the loss in categor"}
{"start": 66500, "text": " which he had. \nQ. The bank -- you mean if the bank has done that, so if the bank has treated the \npayment as discharging the liability of a borrowe r in respect of loan A, he couldn’t \nthen come along and either sue that borrower in respect of loan A or sue a party who \nprocured it, claiming the loss, because there is no loss; correct? \nA. Again, you know, if you please be  more clear what you refer to the loss \nbecause, you know, I said we have three items of loss. \nQ. Yes, the loss in category one. \nA. The loss in category one, yes. \n \n Earlier that day, Mr Beketov had introdu ced what he referred to as the three \ncategories or “counts” of loss available in  Ukrainian law: the amount of which the \nvictim has been deprived, expenses incurred  in the course of restoring his violated \nright, and lost profits.72 The Bank’s claim is for the amount drawn down under \n \n71  Beketov {Day28/44:20} - {Day28/45:23}  \n72  Beketov { Day28/23:24 } - {Day28/24:12 } \nAA3/3/31\n29 \n Relevant Drawdowns, which falls into the first category  (“ category one ” or “ count \none”). \nD2(2)  Repayments funded by Asset Transfers \nD2(2)(a)  Where the loan repaid is valid \n Mr Beketov had no difficulty accepting, where the Loan was valid, that an Asset \nTransfer had the effect both of dischargi ng the liability of the Relevant Borrower \nand of extinguishing any tor tious loss in conne ction with the procurement of the \nloan:73  \nQ. Now, let’s consider the position where there are transferred assets where the bank \nhas credited the borrower’s account, having enforced the mortgage. Between the \nborrower and the bank, when the bank en forces the mortgage over the asset and \ncredits the borrower’s account with the value of the asset as set out in the mortgage \ndocument, the effect is, isn’t it, that th e borrower’s liability, assuming the loan was \nvalid, is discharged by virtue of the ba nk having exercised its mortgage right? \nA. I think it’s basic principle of Ukrainian law, yes. \nQ. Yes, a basic principle of Ukrainian law. So where the borrower’s liability has \nbeen extinguished because, as a matter of Ukrainian law, the borrower is treated as \nhaving repaid his loan in full or for the full outstanding amount, it must also follow as a matter of logic that any liability of a party in tort for procuring that loan will also -- any loss by his tortious conduct will also have been extinguished because the \nloss caused by his tortious conduct is coexte nsive with the liability of the borrower; \ncorrect? \nA. Mr Howard, again, if you talk abou t loss, we should remember three counts, \nso if -- what I outlined. So if you are di scussing count one, it may be the case but \nnot necessarily with count two and count three. \nQ. If it’s count one, it will be the case, won’t it? \nA. Yes.  \n By this answer, Mr Beketov therefore confir med that any liability in tort in respect \nof the primary head of loss, namely the loss of the sum misappropriated, had been \ndischarged by the Asset Transfer. \n \n73  Beketov {Day28/49:16} - {Day28/50:17}  \nAA3/3/32\n30 \n \n Mr Beketov agreed that, if the assets had been overvalued through either negligence \nor fraud, then the creditor would have a separate claim for damages in respect of \nthat unlawful conduct to recover the excess credit  given to the borrower.74 \nD2(2)(b)  Where the loan repaid is void \n It is common ground that if a loan is voi d, a mortgage agreement relating to that \nloan is also void. It is also common gr ound that if the mortgage agreement is void \nthe Bank is not bound by the Credit Value of the asset as stated in the mortgage \nagreement.75 However, the issue is not whether the Bank was bound by the \nmortgage agreement, or the valuation cont ained in it, at the time of the asset \ntransfer, nor indeed whether it is b ound by them now (and the Bank’s Closing \nSubmissions on this topic76 are therefore largely irreleva nt).

{"start": 70000, "text": "e agreement is void \nthe Bank is not bound by the Credit Value of the asset as stated in the mortgage \nagreement.75 However, the issue is not whether the Bank was bound by the \nmortgage agreement, or the valuation cont ained in it, at the time of the asset \ntransfer, nor indeed whether it is b ound by them now (and the Bank’s Closing \nSubmissions on this topic76 are therefore largely irreleva nt). The issue is: what is \nthe consequence of the Bank’s decision to  credit the Borrowe rs with the amount \nthat it did? \n As to that, again, Mr Beketov explained that the Bank had to make a choice. He \nexplained that if the loan being repaid was void the Bank had a choice as to how to \nrespond to the transfer of the assets, but if it chose to retain the assets and give credit \nto the borrower in the full amount of the loan, that bo rrower’s liability to make \nrestitution was discharged:77  \nQ. Now, where there is a transfer of asse ts pursuant to a mortgage and you’ve got a \nvoid loan, the bank similarly has a choice, doesn’t it, as to how it’s going to treat the \ntransfer of the assets? \nA. As a matter of fact, it has. \nQ. Yes. And so it’s in the same position as where there is, as it were, cash. Here it’s \ngot an asset. Now, where the bank chooses to  accept the asset in discharge of the \nborrower’s liability -- so take my example where there is an asset which was valued \nin the mortgage at $10 million,[78] assume the bank takes that asset and then says, \n“I’m going to credit the borrower’s acc ount with $10 million and treat that as a \n \n74  Beketov  {Day28/50:18} - {Day28/51:12} \n75  ULJS/51 { C5/1/22 } \n76  Bank.Closing/722-734 {AA2/15/372}  \n77  Beketov {Day28/54:13} - {Day28/55:11}  \n78  The example just provided was of an asset valu ed at USD 10 million but in fact worth only USD 5 \nmillion: see {Day28/47:15} - {Day28/48:17} . \nAA3/3/33\n31 \n discharge of the borrower’s liability”, firstly , that’s something the bank is entitled to \ndo if it wants to do, isn’t it? \nA. Yes. \nQ. Yes. And if the bank does that, if it chooses to accept this asset which had been \nvalued in the mortgage, if it chooses to  credit $10 million, because it’s received that \nasset, to the borrower’s account, th at will in fact have the effect of discharging the \nborrower’s liability to make restitution, won’t it? \nA. It will discharge -- actually, on your example, it will discharge borrower \nliability, yes. \n \n There was also this later exchange:79  \nQ. Yes, but the point then I was asking you about, just so we’re clear about it -- I \ndon’t want there to be any room for doubt -- is this: the bank -- despite the fact that \nthe mortgage is void, the bank credits th e account of the borrower, so treats the \nliability of the borrower to repay his 10 million as discharged by reason of the bank \nhaving received the asset that was the subject of the mortgage; okay? That’s the factual premise that I’m putting to you. Do you understand? \nA. Yes. \nQ. I think we agree that if the bank does that -- if, as a matter of fact, the bank has \ndone that and has made that choice, then that does indeed, as a matter of law, discharge the liability of the relevant borrower; correct? \nA. Correct. \n \n Mr Beketov then agreed – without any re servation or qualification – that if the \nBorrower’s liability was discharged, because the Bank had chosen to treat the Relevant Loan as fully repaid, so too were the tortious liabilities of third parties for procuring the Relevant Loans:\n80  \nQ. And it would also, therefore, eliminate the liability in tort or it would eliminate \nthe loss within your category one of any tortfeasor who had wrongfully procured the arrangement of that relevant loan? \nA.

It is difficult to conceive of a \nmore leading way to re-examine a witness,82 and for counsel to do so was, with \nrespect, thoroughly inappropriate and illegitim ate. It goes without saying that the \n“evidence ” adduced in this way “ carried no weight and was of no value ”.83 \nD2(3)(a)  The false suggestion that Mr Beketov was confused \n In re-examination, it was suggested to Mr Beketov that he may have been confused \nas to the factual premise of  the questions put to him: \n At various points in your cross −examination, Mr Howard asked you to suppose a \ncase of loans A and B to different corpor ate borrowers both wrongly procured in \nsome way but still valid. Now, again, this is  a debate we will have at another time, \nbut it seems to us that there may have been  some confusion as to what the factual \npremise for those questions were.84 \n Quite apart from the fact that it was inappropriate for counsel to suggest that the \nwitness was confused rather than the witn ess himself making that suggestion, this \nposition – repeated insistently in the Bank’s Closing85 – is untenable.  \n The only context in which Mr Beketov sought  to insist that he had not derogated \nfrom the views expressed in his written reports was when being questioned about \nthe repayment of void loans.  \n(1) He stated that: \n \n81  Beketov {Day29/94:10} - {Day29/98:14} \n82  Mr Howard KC objected at the time: {Day29/96:3-8}  adding, “ I wonder whether we’re going to a \nget a question “When you said ‘Yes’ to Mr Howard, did you mean ‘No’? ” {Day29/97:22} – \n{Day29/98:9}  \n83  Moor v Moor  [1954] 1 WLR 927 {M2/0.3} per Lord Evershed MR   \n84  Hunter KC {Day29/98:15-22}  \n85  Bank.Closing/698, 704, 707 {AA2/15/362}  etc. \nAA3/3/35\n33 \n  Mr Howard … did not refer to the situa tion in where there was a loan recycling \nscheme – effectively saying to me questions that, you know, there could be loan taken, as he put an example, from me and that there was another loan taken \nfrom me, though it was put to me as it was situation with only one loan, not two \nconsecutive loans.\n86 \n(2) He can only have been referring to the example Mr Howard KC gave of Mr \nHunter KC assisting him to steal US D 1 million from Mr Beketov. A possible \nambiguity in that example was identified and, at the Court’s invitation (as set out above), the questions were as ked again to ensure clarity. \n It cannot be suggested that there was any lack of clar ity in any other context: \n(1) The whole basis of the cross-examination,  as was made clear at the outset and \nas Mr Beketov confirmed he understood on the first day (Day 27), was that \nthere were two successive loans, both  of which were unlawfully obtained \nfrom the Bank, with the first being re paid from the proceeds of the second.87 \nQ. … What I want to ask you some questions about is the situation where an \nunlawfully obtained loan, so here looki ng at the relevant drawdowns, is \nrepaid using the proceeds of a later loan; okay? \nA.

Okay. \n(2) On the second day of his cross-examin ation (Day 28), Mr Beketov confirmed \nthat he had understood preci sely the premise of the questions that had been \nput to him the day before.  \n(a) In the course of clarifying the position following Mr Beketov’s \nsuggestion that he had been answ ering questions about the £1m on a \nfalse premise, Mr Beketov acknowledge d that the same mistake had not \nbeen made the previous day (Day 27):88 \nQ. … what I reminded you of this morning was we were discussing the \nsituation where an unlawfully obtained  loan is repaid using the proceeds \nof another unlawfully obtained loan.

Right. \nQ. I now want to ask you about a related topic […]  \n Mr Beketov also acknowledged that he ha d understood the premise of the questions \nput to him based on the repayment of loans by other loans:91  \nNow, we’ve already discussed the question of  whether repayment of relevant loans \nusing the proceeds of later unlawful loan s had the effect of extinguishing both \nliabilities to repay and tortious loss. Now, what I want to ask you about is this, \nagain just setting things in context: we agree that, if the loans were valid, the \noriginal loans, then a repayment did ex tinguish the liability of the borrower and \nextinguish any loss.

ANALYSIS  \nD3(1)  Where the Relevant Loans are valid \nD3(1)(a)  Repayment by further valid lending \n Mr Beketov’s oral evidence confirmed that he agreed that any repayments of \nRelevant Loans using the proceeds of other, valid loans automatically extinguished any loss arising from the Relevant Loans that would otherwise be recoverable in \n \n90  Beketov  {Day28/47:7-10} \n91  Beketov {Day28/49:2-15} \nAA3/3/38\n36 \n tort. Mr Alyoshin’s analysis, on which he wa s not directly challenged, was also to \nthis effect.92  \n In this respect, Ukrainian law precisely reflects English law, as explained by \nToulson J in Komerční Banka AS v Stone & Rolls Ltd  [2003] 1 Lloyd’s Rep \n383.93  \n(1) In that case, a bank was indu ced by a series of frauds to  issue letters of credit \n(“LCs”) in favour of a company called BCL. The proceeds of the LCs were \nused to repay advances under other, earlier LCs. The facts are therefore \nmaterially similar to the alleged facts of this case. \n(2) Toulson J explained at [168] that the repayment of an LC by money obtained \nunder a later LC was effective to extingui sh the tortious loss arising from the \nfirst LC even if the later LC  was also obtained by fraud:94 \n“It is necessary in each case to identify the relevant venture or transaction. In \nthe present case there were a considerable number of them. Each time the bank \naccepted fraudulently presented documents, it accepted liability under a \nseparate LC; but with that liability went the benefit of a right to reimbursement by BCL. If the bank received such reimbursement from or on behalf of BCL, \nthat would extinguish the bank’s loss in respect of that transaction, whatever \nthe derivation of the funds may have been. So, if the proceeds of LC No. ൬ were \nused to reimburse the bank in respect of LC No. ൫, that would extinguish the \nbank’s loss in respect of LC No. ൫. In this regard the identity of the beneficiary \nunder the LC is immaterial. Conversely, if the bank did not receive such reimbursement in respect of LC No. ൬, its loss in respect of that LC remains. \nThe fact that the proceeds of LC No. ൬ may have been used to reimburse the \nbank in respect of LC No. ൫ (or some other obligation owed to the bank) is in \nmy view irrelevant to the bank’s claim in respect of LC No. ൬”. \n To similar effect is the analysis of  Bryan J, applying Russian law, in National Bank \nTrust v Yurov  [2020] EWHC 100 (Comm) – another case involving fraudulently \nobtained bank loans which were used to repay earlier liabilities. Rejecting an \nargument by the defendants that the claimant bank had suffered no loss because the \n \n92  Alyoshin2/35-38 {C7/1/15}  \n93  Komerční Banka AS v Stone & Rolls Ltd  [2003] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 383 {M2/6} \n94  Komerční  {M2/6/21} \nAA3/3/39\n37 \n money drawn down had been used to repay pre-existing liabilities, the Court said \nat [1193] that:95 \n“It is not right as it looks only at the Ba nk’s net financial position, ignores the fact \nthat the earlier loan has in f act been repaid and fails to analyse whether the fraudulent \nconduct in fact caused the loss with which the Bank is left. The fallacy and sleight-of-hand is that what is obscured is the f act that when wrongfully obtained money is \nused to repay the initial loan, the origin al loan loss is not “deferred”, it is \nextinguished. What subsists, is the loss cau sed by the fraud not the original lending. \nThis loss (even if in the same amount) is  a different loss caused by a different \nevent…” \n Indeed, significantly, M"}

What subsists, is the loss cau sed by the fraud not the original lending. \nThis loss (even if in the same amount) is  a different loss caused by a different \nevent…” \n Indeed, significantly, Mr Be ketov in his written eviden ce had positively relied on \nthe reasoning at [1192] of Yurov  to support his view that Ukrainian law would not \nuphold a defence along the lines of the argumen t that was raised in that case. Yet \nhe (or whoever drafted this part of his repor t) omitted to mention that the very next \nparagraph of the judgment, as well as the Komerční judgment which Bryan J cited \nat [1195]-[1196],96 were wholly inconsistent with, and destructive of, his theory \nthat repayments of loans could be “ ignored ” so as to leave the original tortious loss \ncaused by an unlawfully obtained drawdown unaffected by the repayment. It would have been interesting to explore the reas ons for this with Mr Beketov had it been \nnecessary to do so – but it was not necessa ry, in light of his ready acceptance that \nrepayments of loans did extinguis h any tortious loss after all. \n The Bank seeks to distinguish or explain aw ay the reasoning in these two cases in \nits Closing Submissions,97 but what it says makes no sense at all:  \n(1) First, the Bank points out that both cases  were concerned wi th a Use of Funds \nDefence rather than a Repayment Defence. That is true, and is explained by the fact that both claimants were naturally and correctly suing on the later \ntransactions which had caused them loss,  as opposed to earl ier loans that had \nbeen repaid (there bei ng no jurisdictional impera tive to do otherwise). \nHowever, the key reason why Toulson a nd Bryan JJ rejected the Use of Funds \nDefence was specifically that (per Toulson J) “ if the proceeds of LC No 2 \n \n95  Yurov  {M2/11/377} \n96  Yurov  {M2/11/378}  \n97  Bank.Closing/783 {AA2/15/400}  \nAA3/3/40\n38 \n were used to reimburse the bank in resp ect of LC No 1, that would extinguish \nthe bank’s loss in respect of LC No 1 ”; and (per Bryan J) “ when wrongfully \nobtained money is used to repay the initial loan, the original loan loss is not \n‘deferred’, it is extinguished. ” That language is unambiguous and is nothing \nless than a judicial statement (indeed  two judicial statements) of the \nRepayment Defence.  \n(2) The Bank also emphasises that the liabilities that were repaid in Komerční \nand Yurov  arose under valid loans, whereas  on its case the Relevant Loans \nwere void. But there is no suggestion in either of th e two judgments that the \nvalidity or invalidity of the loans made any difference to the analysis,98 and \nthe Bank does not explain (at any rate intelligibly) why it should. Whether \nthe loans are valid or not, the performance of the borrower’s obligation to repay extinguishes both the Borrower’s liability in contract/restitution and \nany loss that could otherwise be the subject of a claim in tort. \nD3(1)(b)  Repayment by Asset Transfer \n If the Loans and the mortgages granted ove r the transferred assets were valid, the \nenforcement of the mortgages automatically discharged the liability of the Relevant \nBorrowers to the extent of the agreed value of the assets. \nD3(2)  Where the Relevant Loans are void \nD3(2)(a)  Repayment by further void lending \n If the Relevant Loans are void then the eff ect of Mr Beketov’s evidence is that the \nBank has suffered no loss in respect of the Re levant Loans if and to the extent that \nit has chosen to accept payments as discha rging the Relevant Borrower’s liabilities \nto return the sums drawn down under th e Relevant Loans, as opposed to other \nliabilities in respect of later loans.99  \n \n98  In Komerční, at least, the LCs were frau"}

Under English law a debtor who owes more than one debt to \nthe same creditor may, in principle, appropriate a payment to a particular debt, but if it fails to do so \nthe creditor can make the choice itself: Thomas v Ken Thomas Ltd  [2006] EWCA Civ 1504 \nAA3/3/41\n39 \n \n The key question on this analysis is ther efore a factual one, namely whether the \nBank has indeed made that choice. The answer  to that is self-evidently ‘Yes’: see \nSection D3(4)  below. \nD3(2)(b)  Repayment funded by Asset Transfer \n If the Relevant Loans and the mortgages s ecuring them were void, the Bank was in \nprinciple obliged to return the mortgaged assets to the mortgagors, but (according \nto Mr Beketov) it may also have been entit led to choose to reta in them instead and \ncredit the Relevant Borrowers. Again, the Bank plainly has made a choice to retain \nthe Transferred Assets and treat the Borrowers as having repaid their liabilities to the extent of the Credit Values, and any liability in tort has accordingly been \ndischarged.  \n D1 does not need, in these circumstances, to rely on the Ukrainian law doctrine of \nvenire contra factum proprium . However, if there were any scope (which there is \nnot) for the Bank to ignore the credits it gave to the Borrowers in respect of the transferred assets, so as to claim damage s from D1 on the fictitious basis that the \nBorrower’s liabilities somehow remained outstanding, this would be a clear case \nfor the application of the venire  principle:  \n(1) It is common ground that venire  is a substantive principle of Ukrainian law \nwhich, where it applies, prevents a part y from acting inconsistently with its \nown previous conduct.\n100 \n(2) There is a disagreement between the experts as to whether detrimental \nreliance is a necessary condition for the principle to apply. Mr Beketov said \nthat it did, referring to Supreme Cour t decisions which identify detrimental \nreliance as part of the test;101 Mr Alyoshin disagreed, suggesting that while \n \n{M2/6.2/6}  at [19].

[…] So do you agree with this, that in reality Article 235 doesn’t really \nassist because you -- you can go to Article 228 directly or you’re saying, well, \n235 leads you to Article 228? \nA.

We get to Article 228 \nand we have to ask ourselves: does Article 228 make the loan void; correct? \nA. Correct […] \n(2) In any case, the Bank misunderstands how Article 235 works, and cross-\nexamined Mr Alyoshin on a false understanding of his evidence. Article 235 is concerned with trans actions of a certain type  that are disguised as \ntransactions of a different type – for ex ample, a gift disguised as a sale or a \nlease disguised as a licence. In that situation, the court applies the rules \napplicable to the real transaction (the gi ft or the lease, in these examples). Of \ncourse, if the transaction fails to comply with a rule applicable to that type of transaction – such as a requirement that  certain types of transaction be in \nwriting – and the effect of that non-compliance is to make the transaction void, the transaction will be void. It was never Mr Alyoshi n’s evidence that \n“void transactions aren’t transactions and Article 235 is irrelevant ” as was \nput to him.\n108 Mr Alyoshin’s point, which was correct, was that Article 235 \nis only applicable where what  is sought to be disguise d is a type of transaction \nto which certain rules apply. A “ misappropriation ” is not a type of transaction \nfor these purposes, and it is for that reason that Article 235 is irrelevant.109  \n As to Article 228 (public policy), there was a disagreement between the Ukrainian \nlaw experts as to whether a court can concl ude that the parties to the Relevant Loans \nintended to breach public policy in the abse nce of any criminal conviction. There \nare two very recent judgments of the Ukrainian Supreme Court – Bank Concord110 \nand Prezenta111 which adopt different answers to that question and are not easy to \n \n108  Alyoshin {Day31/81:9-10}  \n109  See Alyoshin1/99-103 {C2/1/35} , Alyoshin2/188-194 {C7/1/65} , Alyoshin {Day31/76:11} – \n{Day31/81:18} . \n110  Bank Concord {C9.12/6} \n111  Prezenta {C9.12/18} \nAA3/3/45\n43 \n reconcile.112 It is unnecessary for the Court to at tempt to resolve this issue, as D1 \naccepts the Bank’s argument in its Closing Submissions113 that it is a question of \nevidence, and thus any Ukrainian rules in this regard would not  apply in English \nproceedings. It is however reasonable to point  out the unfairness in the fact that D1 \nhas been deprived of  the opportunity even to argue this point as a result of the \nBank’s decision to engage in what is on  any view an extreme form of forum-\nshopping. \n The question remains whether Relevant Loan s are within the substantive scope of \nArticle 228(1)-(2).

Consistently with that, the Ukrainian cases ap plying Article 228 involve collusive \nagreements to defraud a third party (frequently a tax authority), not agreements which one party simply intends not to perform.  \n(2) When it first presented its case to th e Court, the Bank tendered evidence to \nsuggest that the Bank had engaged in the recycling of loans to related parties \nfor many years before 2014.\n115 Although it has since been amended, the \noriginal Particulars of Claim referred to “ Recycling Loans ”.116 \n \n112  The older authorities relied on by the Bank in this regard – Agrofirma  {C9.8/25} , MTIBU \n{C9.8/46.1}  and Tigerfish  {C9.12/3} – are of much more limited valu e since they are simply cases \nwhere contracts were found to breach public polic y: they do not explicitly address the question \nwhether or in what circumstances a criminal conviction is required. \n113  Bank.Closing/479 {AA2/15/271}  \n114  Bank.Closing/497 {AA2/15/280} \n115  Lewis.Aff1/97  {H1/1/22 }; Lewis3/fn 91 { H1/17/66 } \n116  Original Claim/62(1) { A1/1.1/27 } \nAA3/3/46\n44 \n (3) The existence of such a loan recycling scheme was confirmed by the Kroll \nReport which suggested that  it had started in 2009.117 \n(4) In cross-examination by D2, Ms Pakhachuk confirmed that the Relevant \nLoans were part of the loan recycling scheme:118  \nMS MONTGOMERY:  And your analysis suggests that that lending was, to a \nsignificant extent, to related parties an d it was not being repaid but instead \nrolled over in a loan recycling scheme.  That's your understanding, isn't it? \n      A.  Yes, correct, my Lord. \nQ.  So that the loans that we ar e looking at in this case, made in ൬൪൫൭, are part \nof that loan recycling scheme, aren't they? \nA.  My Lord, yes.  There was a scheme of recycling loans for many \nyears.  It was in place for many years. \n \n(5) In many cases, the contemporaneous evid ence demonstrates that the purpose \nof advancing Relevant Drawdowns was to enable funds to move from the \nBank and to be used to repay existing loans, via Prepayments and Returns of Prepayments.\n119 \n(6) It is not disputed by D1 that the Bank issued what were referred to as \n“technical loans ”120 to service companies in order effectively to extend loans \nand circumvent foreign currency controls imposed by the NBU. \n(7) Any suggestion that it can simply be inferred that there was a preconceived \nplan not to return the Unreturned Pr epayments is inconsistent with the \nevidence as to why the Prepay ments could not be returned. \n \n117  See the Executive Summary at { K5-B12/158L/21 } \n118  Pakhachuk {Day13/19:3-12}  \n119  See Section C1(4) , Quantum Annex {AA3/4/27}  \n120  The term “ technical loans ” was used by Mr Yatsenko in Yatsenko1/20 { B2/4/4 }; the term \n“Tech.disbursement ” appears in the contemporaneous documentation – see (for example) the email \nsent on 1 August 2014 by Kazantsev to Gurieva and others regarding a drawdown by Uniks for \nwhich the purpose was described as “ Tech.disbursement.

Clause  1(12) of NBU Resolution No 540 \nprovided: \n“In order to prevent unfair practices of foreign exchange transactions, in \nparticular the purchase of foreign curre ncy under fictitious agreements, which \nare intended for the use of funds for illegal purposes, authorized banks shall form a register for the purchase of foreign currency, which is submitted to the National Bank of Ukraine on the day of r eceipt of the client’s application for \npurchase of foreign currency, together w ith the documents that are the basis \nfor the purchase of foreign currency. The authorized bank shall ensure strict \ncompliance with the requirements of th is sub-clause. In this regard, banks \nmust deny clients lending (advancing) in foreign currency, if such funds are [obtained] to pay the client’s obligations  in foreign currency in order to avoid \nthe requirements of this sub-clause;” \n(b) It appears that, as a result of regulatory changes introduced by the \nNBU121 with effect from 1 Septembe r 2014, those operating the Supply \nAgreement Loan Recycling Scheme w ithin the Bank realised that it \nwould not be possible to allow borro wers to draw down money to make \nprepayments to suppliers as these would come under increased scrutiny \nfrom the NBU and would be prohibited. Indeed, permission was sought for two proposed transactions involving the purchase of USD by Relevant Borrowers but the NBU refused to allow them.\n122 \n(c) At this point, it appears that steps were taken to create letters from the \nsuppliers to each of the borrowers e xplaining that they were unable to \nsupply the goods and promising to repay the prepayments received.123 \nWhen the prepayments were not returned, the Borrowers issued claims against the suppliers.\n124 \n \n121  See Resolution No. 540 dated 29.08.2104 and the letter from the NBU’s Foreign Exchange Control, \nMethodology and Licensing Department dated 01.09.14 {E4/367}  setting out a new procedure for \ndealing with requests to purchase foreign currency  requiring them to be registered with the NBU \nsupported with documents. \n122  Raneya, Karinda, Milorin { K6/47.7/4-5 } and Alfatrader { K6/47.9/2 } \n123  See eg the letter from Collyer to Alfatrader on 26 August 2014 { F124/34/12 } \n124  The 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings an d Arbitration Claims discussed in Section F6(2)(a)  below. \nAA3/3/48\n46 \n (8) The NBU’s intervention prevented any further advances being made as \nPrepayments under Supply Agreements. It is apparent from the Skype \ncommunications at the time that this had not been anticipated.125 \n(9) As a result, this way of advancing funds to Suppliers to enable them to make \nReturns of Prepayment could no longer be  used. This would appear to explain \nthe occurrence of Unreturned Prepayments, and not some pre-ordained scheme to siphon the money that had been  used to fund the Prepayment away \nfrom the Bank three months (or in some cases longer) ago. \n To the extent it matters, th erefore, the Court should c onclude that the Relevant \nLoans were not contrary to public policy so  as to be void under Article 228(1)-(2). \nUltimately, though, the point does not matter because the effect of the repayments \nof the Relevant Loans is to extinguish any loss whether the Relevant Loans were \nvalid or void.  \nD3(4)  If the Loans were void: the Bank ’s choice as a matter of fact \n If (contrary to D1’s primary case) the Lo ans are void, the vital question is whether \nthe Bank has made a choice to allocate th e repayments to the liability of the \nRelevant Borrowers as opposed  to any other liabilities.

Th e answer to th at is self-\nevidently: Yes. \n Throughout 2015 and 2016 when the Bank and the NBU knew all about the Supply \nAgreement Fraud Allegations126 and the misuse of loan s for the benefit of D1,127 \nthe NBU could have required the Bank to declare the Relevant and Intermediary \nLoans void, but it did not do so. Instead, the NBU and the Bank together determined a plan which would treat them all as valid  with a view to securing their repayment \nor collateralisation:  \n \n125  Taranenko, a BOK employee, commented on the NBU’s refusals for the purchase of USD: “ That is \nsuch a fricking mess! ” {K6/47.7/3 } \n126  The earliest evidence of the Bank’s use of fic titious contracts being drawn to the NBU’s attention is \nthe interview with Ms Gontareva published in LigaBusiness on 11.11.14 {E7/32.1/5}  \n127  See, for example, Ms Rozhkova’ s letter to Mr Dubilet of 31.07.15 {E10/266}  identifying companies \n“used to transit funds on behalf of the Bank’s owners” : Rozhkova1/106 {B1/5/25}  \nAA3/3/49\n47 \n (1) The NBU required a Restructuring of th e Bank which involved in part the \nrepayment of loans (including Relevant a nd Intermediary Loans) in return for \nTransferred Assets and the Transformati on of existing loans into New Loans.  \n(2) The Transformation of the remaining lo ans to the 193 Borrowers involved the \nadvance of funds to 36 New Borrowers . Although the NBU knew at the time \nthat the New Loans did not co mply with its requirements,128 the NBU allowed \nthe Bank to make those loans and did not intervene.129 \n However, D1 does not rely for this purpos e on the fact that the Bank initially \ncredited the Relevant Borrowers with repayment while it was owned and arguably \ncontrolled by D1. Rather, he relies on th e fact that the Bank had an opportunity \nwhen new management was appointed follo wing its nationalisa tion at the end of \n2016 to decide which loans to treat as valid  and repaid and cons ciously decided to \ntreat the New Loans as valid and outstand ing and the loans to the 193 Borrowers as \nhaving been repaid. The Bank has mainta ined this position to this day. \n In summary: \n(1) A report produced for the Bank by EY in November 2016 suggested that some \nof the assets transferred to the Ba nk to repay outstanding loans had been \novervalued.130   \n(2) By the end of 2016 almost all of the Relevant and Intermediary Borrowers \nhad been categorised by the NBU as Type 529 Related Parties (i.e. companies used to transit funds on behalf of  the Bank’s owners) and the Bank was \ninformed of those findings in the NBU’s Report on Related Parties.\n131  \n \n128  Rozhkova { Day8/126:2-11 }, {Day8/128:19 } - {Day8/129:6 } \n129  Rozhkova { Day8/128:22-129:5 } \n130  EY Report dated 22.11.2016 { E16/178/79-81 } \n131  NBU Decision on Related Parties dated 14 December 2016 { E17/36 } \nAA3/3/50\n48 \n (3) The Bank’s new management was br iefed by the NBU on the Supply \nAgreement Fraud Allegations by the NBU in January 2017: see Section  \nF8(2)(e) below. \n(4) The NBU’s Audit Report dated 27 January 2017,132 addressed a number of \nmatters relating to the means by which loans to the 193 Borrowers (including \nsome Relevant and Intermediary Lo ans) had been repaid including: \n(a) concerns about the Asse t Transfer, including: \n(i) the overvaluation of Transferred Assets;133  \n(ii) the Bank’s title to Transferred Assets;134 and \n(iii) specific concerns relating to Hotel Zirka,135 Hotel Mir,136 and \nterms on which aircraft had been transferred to Dilorsano.137 \n(b) concerns about the security for th e New Loans which consisted of the \npledge of rights to the supply of goods.138 \n \n132  NBU Audit Repo"}

CONCLUSION  \n For the above reasons, the Bank’s attempt to claim that the repayments of Relevant \nLoans can be ignored, and a claim in tort to  recover the value of the Relevant Loans \nstill lies notwithstanding their repayment, must be rejected. It is both conceptually \nincoherent and (unsurprisingly) not borne  out by anything in Uk rainian legislation \nor court practice. The Bank was able to maintain the argument down to trial solely on the basis of the written speculations of Mr Beketov, but that  evidence has fallen \naway in light of Mr Beketov’s cross-examination in which he rightly accepted, repeatedly and unequivocally, that the repayments of Relevant Drawdowns \nnecessarily extinguished any tortious claims in resp ect of those drawdowns.  \n Whether the Relevant Loans are valid or voi d does not ultimately matter. If they \nwere valid, the repayments automatically ta ke effect. If they were void, the Bank \nhas accepted the repayments as discharging the Relevant Borrowers’ liabilities and \ncannot now claim that those liab ilities somehow still subsist. \n Accordingly, the Repayment Defence succeed s, and the majority of the claim falls \nto be dismissed on that basis.  \n RESPONSE TO THE BANK ’S FURTHER ARGUMENTS \nON LOSS \n Mr Beketov’s answers to questions in cro ss-examination demonstrated that what he \nhad said in his expert reports was untenab le. Nevertheless, the Bank persists with \narguments that the repayments of the Rele vant Loans were not effective and should \nbe ignored. These arguments must all be re jected as being both inconsistent with \nthe evidence at trial and misconceived in principle. \nE1. NO CHOICE BETWEEN TORTS  \n A point which Mr Beketov did not make in the course of being cross-examined was \nthat the Bank had any kind of choice of suing on a tort invol ving the inducement of \nLoan 1 or a tort inducing Loan 2 when that loan had been used to repay Loan 1. His \nAA3/3/56\n54 \n evidence was clear. The Borrower’s debt in  contract or restitu tion was extinguished \nand so was any liability in tort of someone who had procured Loan 1.  \n The Bank therefore seriously misrepresents the position where it submits in its \nClosing Submissions149 that Mr Beketov’s oral evidence was that, where there are \ntwo void loans and Loan 1 is repaid using the proceeds of Loan 2, “ the bank/victim \ncan elect whether to bring a claim in resp ect of the loss caused by loan 1 or loan \n2”.

That part of the cross-examination to which the transcript reference is given150 \nwas concerned with the Bank’s choice as to  whether to accept a repayment of funds \nas being in respect of Loan 1 or Loan 2.  It had nothing to do with whether the Bank \ncould choose to sue for the tortious loss cau sed by the extraction of Loan 1 after it \nhad been repaid.  \n Mr Beketov’s re-examination, on the othe r hand, began with his being shown the \nspecific paragraphs of his wr itten reports in which he ha d expressed the view that a \nvictim of two consecutive torts could choose to which tort to attribute its loss. It was striking that even after having been  reminded of the Bank’s case, and having \nbeen asked questions formulated with a view to avoiding any “ confusion ”, Mr \nBeketov still did not give the answers th at the Bank’s counsel hoped he would. \n(1) In a lengthy exchange,151 counsel for the Bank put to Mr Beketov a scenario \nin which Loan 1 in the amount of USD 10 million was procured for Borrower 1 by an officer of the Bank who was both behind Borrower 1 and defrauding \nthe Bank in tortious breach  of duty. He was asked to  assume that this loan \nwas valid. Mr Beketov confirmed that  the Bank had cont ractual rights to \nenforce the loan and had a claim in to rt against the Bank officer. Mr Beketov \nwas then asked to consider a scenario in which a year later the same Bank officer did the same thing again and pr ocured Loan 2 to Borrower 2 in the \namount of USD 10 million which was also valid but “ the purpose of this \nsecond loan is to cover up the first and stop the officer being found out, so to \n \n149  Bank.Closing/704 {AA2/15/363}  \n150  Beketov {Day28/38:22} - {Day28/39:14}  \n151  Beketov {Day29/99:6} - {Day29/104:12}  \nAA3/3/57\n55 \n use a phrase from today, [152] it’s all part of one misappropriation scheme by \nthe officer ”. It was specifically clarified th at the source of the repayment of \nthe first loan “ is bank’s own money ”. Mr Beketov confirmed that there would \nbe no claim in contract against Borrow er 1 but the Bank would have a claim \nin contract against Borrower 2 when th e loan reached maturity. Mr Beketov \nwas then asked to assume that the pr ocurement of Loans 1 and Loans 2 had \ninvolved two consecutive torts. \n(2) There was then this question and answer:153  \nQ. Can you explain, in your view, whether at the end of stage 2 the bank \nofficer is still liable in tort 1 and tort 2 or whether you think that his liability has changed? \nA. Mr Hunter, I believe liability in tort is liability in loss, as I said to Mr \nHoward, so I consider there are three counts of loss under Article 22. It \nis said that it is not losses, it is ac tually things which a person was deprived \nof, the second thing is expense and the third thing is lost profit. So on that basis, I believe that repayment of -- to borrower 1 does not fully \nextinguish loss under tort in any event. \n(3) All Mr Beketov was saying here was that  the Bank would still be entitled to \nrecover damages in tort in respect of Loan 1 (i.e. a Relevant Drawdown) if it \nhad caused loss over and above the disbur sements of funds, i.e. incidental \ncosts or lost profits.154 It remained his view that the primary loss, in the \namount of the disbursement of funds  under Loan 1, would have been \nextinguished by the reimbursement usi ng the funds derived from Loan 2.  \n Counsel for the Bank continued:155 \nQ. Okay, can you explain in your view whether the bank can choose whether to \nclaim against the bank officer in respect of tort 1 or tort 2 or whether it’s somehow confined to the one or the other? \nA. No, I believe it still may be a claim in respect of tort 1 and tort 2 because, \nas it is in my evidence, actually in th e situation where actually two consecutive \n \n152  Mr Beketov had not used that term w"}

(On this point, the Bank’s Closing is replete with references  to the concept of “ full compensation ” (it is \nmentioned over 50 times) but it does not bear anything like the weight \nthe Bank seeks to place on it. Th e Ukrainian Civil Code does \nunsurprisingly provide that tortious harm is to be compensated in full; \nbut that is immaterial insofar as the question raised  by the Repayment \nDefence is whether any harm actually exists to be compensated. For the reasons already explained, any lo ss in respect of the Relevant \n \n156  Article 15 {C1/6/1}  \n157  Article 316 {C1/6/9}  \n158  Article 1192 {C1/6/13}  \nAA3/3/59\n57 \n Drawdowns has been exti nguished and can no long er be the subject of \na claim for compensation. If the Bank suffered other loss as a result of \nother wrongdoing by D1 then it would have been entitled to be fully \ncompensated for that loss, had it not expressly chosen to exclude it from \nits claim.) \n Moreover, none of the justif ications for the supposed “ choice ” principle Mr \nBeketov had attempted in his written evidence is adequate: \n(1) In the Joint Statement on Ukrainian Law, Mr Beketov asserts that:  \n“It would be contrary to principles of justice, reasonableness and fairness if a \ntortfeasor could eliminate the harm caused by stealing money from his victim \nby stealing more money from his victim and returning that money to the victim in purported compensation for the earlier theft.”\n159   \nNo reasoning is offered for this conclusion.

There is nothing unjust,  unreasonable or unfair about that.  \n(2) In his 8\nth report, Mr Beketov opined that to confine the victim to a claim on \nthe second tort would create a “ perverse incentive for the tortfeasor…to \ncommit a further tort that  might not be discovered ”.160 Self-evidently, \nhowever, a victim can only exercise a c hoice as to which tort to sue upon if it \nhas discovered both torts, so this reas oning makes no sense. It does not feature \nin the Bank’s Closing Submissions. \n(3) Instead, the Bank’s Closing Submissions make a (new) argument that, if a \nclaimant could not choose whether to at tribute its ultimate loss to an earlier \ntort or a later tort at its discretion, a defendant could “ engineer the fraud…in \norder to predetermine in whose hands  the ‘hot potato’ of loss ends up ”.161 \nThis is scarcely comprehensible, let alone compelling. Regardless of who the ultimate borrowers were, the Bank would always have had a claim in tort \n \n159  ULJS/46.1 {C5/1/20}  \n160  Beketov8/139 {C1/1/45} \n161  Bank.Closing/807 {AA2/15/409} \nAA3/3/60\n58 \n against D1, provided only that it made a claim for its overall loss and did not \nartificially confine itself to a claim on  a specific group of historic loans which \nit knew had been repaid. \n(4) In its Written Opening, the Bank made the further argument that a victim in \nthe Bank’s position should not have to “ untangle ” the process by which loans \nwere repaid using other loans.162 But this too is misconceived, since the Bank \nhas no need to “ untangle ” anything: its true loss is simply the unpaid balance \nof Loan 2 (the proxy for the Intermedia ry and New Loans). The position is in \nfact the opposite of what the Bank suggests: the factual complexity in \ninvestigating how loans were repaid, and in particular to what extent \nIntermediary Loans were “ ultimately ” repaid from sources external to the \nBank only arises because the Bank has chos en to confine its claim to historic \nloans that have been repaid, instead of the later loans that actually caused its loss. It is wholly implausible to suggest  that Ukrainian law contemplates this \nkind of exercise being undertaken when it serves no necessary or useful purpose.  \n Contrary to what the Bank and Mr Beketov have variously said, there are in fact \nstrong policy reasons why a claimant should not be permitted to sue in tort on the fictitious basis that a loan has not been repaid when in fact it has:  \n(1) First, as a matter of principle, what is the test that determines when such a \nclaim ought to be allowed? The Bank and Mr Beketov’s reports variously \nanalyse the position by reference to void loans,\n163 “unlawful loans ”,164 \n \n162  Bank.Opening/544-545 {AA2/1/212}  \n163  Beketov8/137 {C1/1/44} : Mr Beketov was instructed to cons ider whether the Bank’s claim was \naffected by the fact that repayments were made from funds advanced under other loans “ all of which \nwere void ”. \n164  Beketov8/137 {C1/1/44} : “where monies purportedly used to repay an unlawful loan…are \nthemselves referable to other, unlawful lending ” \nAA3/3/61\n59 \n “unlawfully procured loans ”,165 and “ fraudulent loans ”;166 but in which cases \ndoes the supposed rule that  permits repayments to be  ignored actually apply, \nand what might be the justification fo r distinguishing betw een these different \nscenarios (void and fraudul ent / void but not fraudul ent / fraudulent but not \nvoid) when the economic facts are exactly the same?

Neither the Bank nor Mr Beketov has ever sought to explain this.  \n(2) Secondly, despite Mr Beketov’s assu rance that Ukrainian law would not \npermit double-recovery,\n167 a rule which allowed repayments of earlier loans \nto be ignored for the purposes of a to rtious claim demonstrably would give \nrise to double recovery in many cases . To take a simple example, on the \nBank’s case, D1 could be held liable  for procuring a Relevant Drawdown, \neven though this was repaid by a dr awdown under a New Loan, and at the \nsame time continue to pursue the New Borrower for repayment. Of course there would be no double recovery on th e facts if the New Borrower failed to \nmake any repayment at all; but the Bank and Mr Beketov have never suggested that repayments can be ignore d only in that extr eme situation. On \nthe Bank’s case, therefore, there woul d be a likelihood of double recovery in \nevery case where the ultimate borrower wa s not totally devoid of assets. That \ncannot possibly be right.  \n If the Bank ever had a choice, it was only in cases where the Loans were void and \nit had not yet chosen whether to accept a repayment as reimbursing the Bank in \nrespect of the first or sec ond loan. In this case, as Mr  Beketov put it, where money \nadvanced under Loan 2 was offered as reimbursement of funds advanced under Loan 1, the Bank had to make a choice whether to accept the money as discharging the restitutionary liability in respect of Loan 1 or Loan 2. Once the choice was made, \n \n165  Beketov9/199 {C6/1/82} : “Mr Alyoshin and I disagree as to whether it makes any difference to the \nBank’s tort claim if a particular Relevant Loan was purportedly repaid from funds advanced by the \nBank under other (also unlawfully procured) loans .” \n166  Beketov9/196 {C6/1/81} refers to “ fraudulent loans whereby later loans used to (purportedly) repay \nearlier loans ”  \n167  Beketov8/140 {C1/1/45}  \nAA3/3/62\n60 \n the Bank could only sue in tort in respect  of the loss caused by the disbursement \nwhich (as a result of its choi ce) had not been reimbursed.  \n If both loans were valid, the Bank had no choice. The repayment of Loan 1 using \nthe proceeds of Loan 2 necessarily discha rged the Borrower’s liability under Loan \n1 and with it any liability in tort in respect of the drawdown under that loan.  \nE2. RESPONSE TO THE “OVERALL LOSS ” ARGUMENT  \nE2(1)  The Bank is not entitled to claim for loss caused by \nmisappropriations through other loans \n An alternative basis on which the repayments might be “ ignored ” was developed \nin the Bank’s Written Opening Submissions and developed in the Bank’s Handout  \nproduced in the course of its Oral Opening Submissions.168 It now appears to be the \nBank’s case that if a repayment comes at  the expense to the Bank of a further \nmisappropriation of funds, the Bank has not been compensated because its loss is not diminished. \n “The Bank’s case in outline is that (i) repayment by Intermediary Drawdowns and \nNew Loans does not reduce the Bank’s loss, or constitute a genuine recovery, \nbecause these sources involved further m oney being unlawfully extracted from the \nBank, such that no credit is to be given for such purported repayments…”169 \n Example 1 in the Handout involved thre e Relevant Drawdowns over three days \neach of USD 100 million.170 At the end of Day 3, there is USD 300 million owed \nby Borrower 1 under a Relevant Loan and the Bank’s loss is said to be USD 300 million as a result. \n On Day 4, an Intermediary Loan is made to Borrower 2 in the amount of USD 100m \nand Borrower 2 uses that money r"}

At the end of Day 4, the Bank c ontends that while the balance under the \nRelevant Loan has been reduced to USD 200m, its loss is still USD 300m. \n Although the Bank denies it,171 the fallacy in this example is plain to see. It is that \nthe Bank’s “ loss” is only USD 300m if what is being considered is the Bank’s \noverall loss resulting from two drawdowns  of USD 100m under a Relevant Loan \nand USD 100m under an Intermediary Loan.  \n However, taking account of a loss caused to the Bank by a dvancing an Intermediary \nDrawdown involves an expansion of its  claim beyond the narrow basis on which \nthe Bank chose to plead it in these proceedings. As emphasised in Section C  above, \nfor the purposes of establishing jurisdic tion, the Bank carefully and deliberately \nconfined itself to claiming for loss arising from the Relevant Drawdowns so as to \nmatch the misappropriation to the expense id entified for the purpose of the claim in \nUnjust Enrichment against D3-D8. The Bank’s Closing Submissions expressly confirm that its claim is “ not for loss suffered as a result of the Intermediary \nDrawdowns ”.\n172 \n The fact that an additional claim is bei ng taken into account when an Intermediary \nDrawdown counts towards loss is explaine d in the Handout when an attempt is \nmade to distinguish a repayment of a Relevant Drawdown funded by another \nRelevant Drawdown. In that case, the loss is reduced: \n “this is … because – unlike on Day ൮ – as a matter of fact this represents the return \nof money to the Bank without an associated  equivalent misappropriation…. This is \na true reversal of the misappropriation …”173 \n The advance of funds to the Intermediary  Borrower is itself  a misappropriation on \nthe Bank’s case. This involves a separate loss and a separate tort. As Bryan J put it \nin the passage quoted from Yurov  above, once the (fraudulent) Intermediary \nDrawdown has been used to re pay the Relevant Drawdown “ What subsists, is the \nloss caused by the fraud not the original lending. This loss (even if in the same \namount) is a different loss c aused by a different event… ” \n \n171  Bank.Closing/794 {AA2/15/404} \n172  Bank.Closing/773 {AA2/15/391} \n173  Day 2 – Hogan Lovells hand up {AA6/2/3}  \nAA3/3/64\n62 \n \n The Bank has not sued for a ny loss caused by In termediary Loans. Any loss caused \nby any misappropriation involved in adva ncing the Intermediary Drawdown is \nirrelevant when considering the claim advanced in these proceedings. \n Similarly, no discount should be given on account  of the fact that when Assets were \ntransferred to the Bank and credit for them  was granted, they came at the cost of \ndamage caused to the Bank by further torti ous conduct in their over-valuation. The \nonly proper claim, if available on the fact s, would be a claim against whoever was \nresponsible for any negligent or fraudulen t overvaluations of assets which caused \nthe Bank to give an excessive amount of  credit to the Relevant Borrowers. \nHowever, the Bank has eschewed any claim of that kind.  \n The Bank’s realisation of the flaw in its argument may explain why only a half-\nhearted attempt was made to put any of th is to Mr Alyoshin in cross-examination.174 \nBy the time that exe"}

Mr Alyoshin considered that this al so represented Ukrainia n law, and in cross-\nexamination by counsel for D1, Mr Beketov agreed with him.  \n Mr Alyoshin carefully indicated that the position would be diffe rent if the Court \nwere to analyse the case as one in whic h the repayment of th e Relevant Drawdown \ndid not extinguish the Bank’s loss.177 That position is not “ unprincipled ”178 as it \nwas put to him in the course of his cross- examination and as the Bank claims in its \nClosing Submissions.179 On the contrary, it is logical  and correct because, if the \nCourt were to make that finding then, n ecessarily, it would have decided that the \nreasoning in Yurov  and Komerční was not applicable under Ukrainian law and \n(contrary to the approach in those cases) would be sanctioning an enquiry into the \nnet financial position of the Bank follow ing the alleged misa ppropriation of funds \nand any repayments.  \n In that event, there would be no reason to credit D1 only with the benefits that the \nBank accepts it has received (for example, repayments of Relevant Drawdowns by \nRelevant Drawdowns, the “ true value ” of Transferred Assets, and money from \nexternal sources). Account would also have  to be taken of be nefits obtained by the \nBank through the return of the money to the Bank.  \n In this regard, it is completely false for the Bank to submit that:  \n“the Bank’s ledgers tell us what was done w ith the relevant drawdowns.

D1 relies on the fact that the Bank \npositively asserts that all the 193 Borrowers whose loans were repaid in the course of Transformation were “ incapable of repaying ” their loans.\n185  \n(4) In just the same way as the Bank conte nds that the repayment of a Relevant \nDrawdown using an Intermediary Dr awdown leaves the Bank no better off \nbecause the loss associated with the fu rther alleged misappropriation offsets \nthe benefit of repayment of the first, it must be recognised that the use of \nallegedly misappropriated money to  repay bad debts which would not \notherwise have been repaid leaves the Bank no worse off. In those circumstances the Relevant Drawdown caused the Bank no loss. \n The reason why Toulson J rejected any sugge stion that credit should be given for \nthe use of funds obtained by deceit in Komerční was that he considered, in that \ncase, that the use of funds was too remo te.

However, the conclusion follows a fortiori  in circumstances where (as is confirmed by the contemporary \ndocumentation\n186) the true purpose of the Releva nt Drawdowns was to fund those \nrepayments.

THE BANK’S FLIP -FLOP : ALL JUST “BOOK ENTRIES ”  \n In places in its submissions the Bank has dr awn, or hinted at, a distinction between \n“genuine ” repayments which brought “ value ” into the Bank, and mere “ book \nentries ” which do not entail or reflect any “ genuine ” reversal of the Relevant \nDrawdowns, and suggested that the repaym ents of the Relevant Loans belong in \nthe latter category and are to be  ignored for that reason.  \n The Bank has been unclear and inconsistent  as to whether, in characterising the \nrepayments of the Relevant Loans and th e granting of the Intermediary and New \nLoans as mere “ book entries ”, it contends that they did not involve any movements \nof money at all, or whet her it accepts that they did involve movements of money \nbut says that those movements are to be ignored because they did not reduce its loss.  \n \n186  See Section C1(4)  of the Quantum Annex {AA3/4/27}  \nAA3/3/68\n66 \n \n Insofar as its case is the latter, this is the “ overall loss ” fallacy that has been exposed \nabove. In the schematic language  that has come to be used  in this case , the losses \ncaused by Loan 1 and Loan 2 are different losses caused by different events, and the former is extinguished when Loan 1 is  repaid, irrespective of the source of the \nrepayment.  \n In its Oral Opening Submissions, however,  the Bank appeared to incline towards \nthe former position, departing from the point s that had been made  in its pleadings \nand its expert evidence: \n(1) The Bank first insisted that its claim was for the loss of real money: \n“It’s critical to recognise that our case is that the misappropriation caused harm \nto the Bank in the form of a series of direct immediate losses to the Bank, i.e. \nthe extraction of its money through ൬൱൪ relevant drawdowns. The harm we rely \nupon is deprivation of property, money. The essence of our case is that there \nwere ൬൱൪ separate misappropriations of the Bank’s money in the form of the \nrelevant drawdown. Conceptually, our case is no different than if the first and second defendants had visited the Bank’s vaults ൬൱൪ times and over those ൬൱൪ \noccasions simply taken out $ ൬ billion of the Bank’s money. That’s the starting \npoint. ”\n187 \n(2) The Bank then sought to distinguish the “ repayments ” from the Relevant \nDrawdowns contending that they could be ignored because no money moved \nat all: “ Nothing has been paid back to the Bank. This is just an exercise in \nshuffling fraudulent paperwork. ”188 \n(3) The Bank described the loan (documentation189) as a sham used only to \n“cover ” the loss caused by the misappropriatio n of funds (the extraction of \nmoney).190 The Bank contended that:  \n(a) in return for the real money advanced with the Relevant Drawdowns, \nthe Relevant Borrowers left be hind the equivalent of an “ IOU” in the \n \n187  Hunter KC {Day2/60:17} - {Day2/61:4}. That analogy is misconceived.  As explained above, the \nevidence shows that the vast majority of the funds alleged to have been misappropriated were passed \nback to the Bank within a day or so as part of a Loan Recycling Scheme. \n188  Hunter KC {Day2/9:16-23}  \n189  Hunter KC {Day2/79:2} - {Day2/80:16}  \n190  Hunter KC {Day2/76:18} - {Day2/84:25}  \nAA3/3/69\n67 \n form of the balance outstanding on the Relevant Loan (which was void) \nand that switching one borrower fo r another did not involve any “ real” \nmovement of money; \n(b) when an Intermediary Borrower repaid a Relevant Borrower, the Bank \ncontends that all that happened wa s that one IOU was replaced with \nanother;191  \n(c) similarly, when a New Loan repaid the Intermediary and Relevant \nLoans"}

That it felt compelled to advance such an extreme argument at such a late stage of the proceedi ngs serves only to highlight the lack of \nany proper foundation for its previous contention that (real) repayments were somehow to be “ ignored ” or “ disregarded ” pursuant to some principle of Ukrainian \nlaw. \n Not only is there no factual basis for the Bank’s suggestion that no funds moved \nbut the contention that the repayment tran sactions all took place  only on paper and \nnothing actually happened is  contradicted by the Bank’s own pleaded case. In the \nBank’s Reply,194 it is stated: \n“The so-called Cash Repayments identified in Schedule ൫ to the D൫ Defence were \nprocured by D ൫ and D൬ and caused by and/or made using funds  derived from \nIntermediary Loans. As such, they fall to be disregarded and, in any event, did not \nin fact reduce the Bank’s loss.” \n \n191  Hunter KC {Day2/82:4-8}  \n192  Hunter KC {Day2/83:20} - {Day2/84:9}  \n193  Bank.Closing/785  {AA2/15/401} \n194  Reply/27 (starting in fifth line) { A1/25/35 } \nAA3/3/70\n68 \n \n It is not, therefore,  open to the Bank to contend now th at no funds moved at this or \nany later stage. In any event, the Bank’s pleaded case accords with what in fact \nhappened. There was a shuffling of paperw ork in that new fake Supply Agreement \npaperwork had to be created to justify the movement, but there were nevertheless \nactual movements of fu nds at each stage. \n Strictly speaking, of course , a bank payment – whether fr om a bank to a customer’s \naccount or between customer accounts – never involves a “ real” “movement ” of \n“money ”:  \n(1)  A bank transfer is neither real in th e sense of tangibility , nor does it truly \ninvolve “ movement ”: \n“An account transfer means the process by which some other person or \ninstitution comes to owe money to the [customer] or their nominee, and the \nobligation of [the bank] is extinguished or  reduced pro tanto. ‘Transfer’ may be \na somewhat misleading word, since th e original obligation is not assigned \n(notwithstanding dicta in one American case which speak of assignment); a new \nobligation by a new debtor is created.”195   \n(2) Nor does it involve “ money ” strictly so-called:  \n“Money simply consists of the chattel he ld by its owner; other forms of credit \n– such as banking accounts or bills of  exchange – involve the creation of \nobligations. Thus, in the case of a bank account, the bank owes a debit to the account holder, which is a purely personal obligation. The account holder has \nno proprietary claim in any money. Where there is payment in money, an object \nis transferred, and apart from the in re m consequences of ownership, no other \nrights are created. If there is payment by other means, personal obligations are \neither created, or changed.”\n196 \n There is an irreconcilable inconsistency in the Bank’s case (if this is in fact the \nBank’s case) in insisting that the Releva nt Drawdowns all involved real movements \nof money (emphasised by the analogy of  taking money from"}

(Sweet & Maxwell), \nat 2-002 {M2/8.1}  \nAA3/3/71\n69 \n subsequent drawdowns under Intermediary Loans (some of which were themselves \nRelevant Loans) which we re used to repay them. \n Given that there is nothing to distinguish the character of the Relevant Loans from \nthe Intermediary Loans and the New Loans, it is submitted that the Court must make \na binary choice between two conclusions: \n(1) If the Court concludes that the Rele vant Drawdowns involved the movement \nof money (as it is submitted they plainl y did), then the subsequent drawdowns \nunder Intermediary and New Loans used to repay them must also have involved movements of money (as th e Bank pleaded and which reflects \nreality) and the Relevant Drawdowns were repaid.  \n(2) Alternatively, if (contrary to D1’s su bmission that such a case is not open to \nthe Bank and is anyway contrary to the facts) the Court finds that the \nIntermediary and New Loans were merely “ book entries ” and did not involve \nthe movement of money at all, then the Court must also find that the Relevant \nDrawdowns did not involve the movement of money. \n The consequence of the first conclusion is  that the Bank’s loss in respect of the \nRelevant Drawdowns has been extinguished , because the Borrowers have repaid \nthe money that they took via the Releva nt Drawdowns, and that eliminates any \ntortious loss in respect of the Rele vant Drawdowns, as explained above. \n Naturally, if the Court were to reach the second conclusion – that the Relevant \nLoans were merely “ book entries ”, then it would have to conclude that the pleaded \nmisappropriation never occurred and the Ba nk suffered no loss at all as a result of \nthe Relevant Drawdowns. This is D2’s primary case, which is adopted in the \nalternative by D1 if D1’s case is not accepted. \nE4. THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS AND “ABUSE OF RIGHTS ”  \n In relation to the repayments by way of Transferred Assets specifically, the Bank \ncontends that it would be an abuse of D1’s rights, contrary to Article 13 of the Civil \nAA3/3/72\n70 \n Code, to rely on the Credit Values of the transferred assets if D1 deliberately \nprocured the assets to be overvalued.197 \n The Bank relies on Mr Beketov’s evidence that: \n“the abuse of rights rule is wide-ranging in  its application and has been applied in a \nnumber of cases to defeat reliance upon a tran saction entered into with the intent \nand/or effect of making assets unavailable to creditors. In my view, the abuse of rights rule can be applied when transacti ons are entered into to harm creditors’ \ninterests in other ways, such as (in the context of the Bank’s claims) giving a false \nimpression that valuable security had been provided for the Relevant/Intermediary \nLoans, to facilitate the Misappropriation a nd/or to conceal the harm caused to the \nBank by the Misappropriation. Consequently, I consider that the Bank would be able \nto invoke the abuse of rights rule to overcome any reliance placed upon any \nartificia"}

Consequently, I consider that the Bank would be able \nto invoke the abuse of rights rule to overcome any reliance placed upon any \nartificially inflated asset valuations.”\n198 \n Whether D1 did in fact procure the asse ts to be overvalued is addressed at Section \nD(4)  of the Quantum Annex .199 \n If or to the extent that he  did, however, D1 will say th at the Bank’s abuse of rights \nargument is wrong.  \n(1) None of the cases referr ed to by Mr Beketov200 consider facts such as those \nin which he claims the principle might be applied for the benefit of the Bank. \n(2) The argument in any case proceeds on a fa lse basis since (as explained above) \nD1 does not rely on the Credit Values per se , but rather relies on the fact of \nthe Bank having chosen to credit the Bo rrowers with the Credit Values, such \nthat they no longer have any liability in  respect of the Relevant Loans, and \nnot to make any attempt to reverse or  amend the credits following the Bank’s \nnationalisation. D1 is not in this scen ario doing anything at all, let alone \nanything that could be said  to amount to an abuse of a right; he is merely \npointing out the legal cons equences of the Bank’s own actions. That cannot \nsensibly be said to involve the a buse of any right belonging to D1.  \n \n197  Bank.Closing/734 {AA2/15/376}  \n198  Beketov8/144 {C1/1/47}  \n199  Section D(4)  of the Quantum Annex {AA3/4/40}  \n200  Beketov8/81-88 { C1/1/28}  \nAA3/3/73\n71 \n (3) In particular:  \n(a) If a Mortgage Agreement is valid and the Bank accepts a Transferred \nAsset in discharge of a valid Rele vant Drawdown, the Bank must give \ncredit according to the terms of th e Mortgage Agreement. The Relevant \nDrawdown is thereby repaid, and ther e is no longer any loss in respect \nof which D1 might have been liable in tort. \n(b) If an asset was transferred pursuant to a void Mortgage Agreement, the \nBank had a choice whether to accept those funds or that Asset as a \nrepayment of a Relevant Drawdown or to return the funds or the \nTransferred Asset to the transferor . The Bank’s choice to accept the \nrepayment as discharging the liability of the Borrower entails the extinguishing of the loss in respect of which D1 might have been liable \nin tort. \n(4) In both these cases, D1 takes no acti on and the consequence that he is \ndischarged of liability for loss cause d by the Relevant Drawdown is either \nautomatic, as a matter of law, when the Relevant Loan was valid, or a \nconsequence of the Bank’s action if the Relevant Loan was void. There is no \nbasis upon which D1 needs to exercise a right in either scenario and he \ntherefore cannot be said to be abusing a right. Merely to point out that a loss \nhas been extinguished cannot possibly be abusive in itself: to hold otherwise \nwould be tantamount to sayi ng that, where a claim is ba sed on fraud, it is an \nabuse of right for a defendant to rais e any defences at all (beyond, perhaps, \ndenying responsibility for the fraud in fact ); but that self-evi dently cannot be \nand is not the law. \n(5) Nor is there any unfairness in this result.  If the facts alleged by the Bank were \ntrue, the Bank unquestionably had an independent caus e of action in respect \nof any wrongful overvaluations of Tr ansferred Assets for which D1 was \nresponsible, but it chose not to assert it, and to confine its claim to the Relevant Drawdowns, to improve its  prospects of securing English \njurisdiction.

OVERVIEW  \n The evidence at trial demonstrated th at the Bank acquired knowledge (actual or \nconstructive) of the violati on of its rights by D1 in October or early November 2014 \nat the latest. Time had therefore expired by the time proceedings were issued on 21 \nDecember 2017 and the claims are statut e barred under Article 261 of the Civil \nCode.201 \n The Bank now contends – having in effect202 amended its case and adduced further \nexpert evidence from Mr Beketov part-way th rough the trial –  that it did not acquire \neither actual or constructive knowledge of  a violation of its rights before 2014 \nbecause, until a change was made to its  Charter in 2015, it could only acquire \nknowledge for this purpose th rough D1 and D2 as a matter of Ukrainian Law. But \nthis is simply wrong, as Mr Beketov conceded in cross-ex amination. At all material \ntimes, the Bank was able to acquire knowle dge of the relevant facts through (at \nleast) its senior managers, and it did so in October/November 2014. \n The Bank also complains that knowledge of a violation of its rights should not be \nattributed to it while D1 and D2 were in  control of the Bank a nd it was unable to \ntake action against them. That too is wrong.  While it is agreed that the knowledge \nof persons who acted dishonestly is not a ttributable to the Bank, the knowledge of \nother relevant officers is so attributable  regardless of who controlled the Bank or \nwhether it was able, as a practical matter,  to bring proceedings. Knowledge of facts \n \n201  “ The limitation period shall begin to run from the date on which a person became or could have \nbecome aware of a violation of his right or of the person who violated such right”: Article 261 Civil \nCode {C1/6/8}  \n202  No permission was sought for an amendment to re fer specifically to the terms of the Charters in \nforce and their effect. \nAA3/3/75\n73 \n is quite separate from the ability to bri ng proceedings. The correct position is that \ntime runs from the date of knowledge and,  if the claimant is unable to bring \nproceedings within the limitation period, it should ask the Court to disapply the \nlimitation period under Article 267(5).  \n The limitation period had therefore expire d by December 2017 so that – subject \nonly to the possible application of Artic le 267(5) – the claim is bound to be \ndismissed. Mr Beketov agreed that it makes no difference whether the deadline was \nmissed by months, weeks or even days.203 \n As for Article 267(5), that gives the Cour t a power under Ukrainian law to disapply \na limitation period if, for objective reasons beyond the control of the claimant, it \nwas prevented or significantly hindered in its ability to bring proceedings in time. \nThat is plainly not the case here, since the Bank’s witnesses accepted that the Bank \nwas in fact in a position to bring the claim at any time from January 2017 onwards. \nThe Bank therefore had 9 or 10 months  in which it could have commenced \nproceedings without difficulty; yet it faile d to do so. In its Closing Submissions,204 \nthe Bank seeks to justify delaying its decision to bring proceedings by reference to its decisions to conduct nego tiations with D1 and D2 between January and July \n2017 and to prepare an application for a WF O.

THE EVIDENCE RELATING TO LIMITATION  \nF2(1)  The Bank’s witnesses \n Four of the Bank’s witnesses were cross-examined by D1. \n Kateryna Rozhkova.  Ms Rozhkova joined the NBU in 2015. She is now the First \nDeputy Governor of the NBU. She made tw o witness statements in support of the \nBank’s case.206 She declined to respond to requests made to her directly prior to the \ntrial to secure the disclosure of the NBU’s documents.207 Ms Rozhkova was cross-\nexamined over two days by D1 and D2.208 She was not a straightforward witness. \nOften she would respond to questions by an swering an entirely different question. \nSometimes she would insist on emphasising processes and procedures rather than \nanswer simple questions. All too frequen tly she would attempt to fence with her \ncross-examiner before eventually confirming a point that had been put to her several \nquestions earlier. She obviously ha d an agenda and a prepared mantra209 and was \nattempting to protect the Bank’s position as  best she could. Ultimately, however, \nher efforts were to no avail and she was forced to concede a series of points that \n \n206  Rozhkova1 { B1/5 }; Rozhkova2 { B1/18 } \n207  See Section F2(3)  below \n208  Counsel for D1 cross-examined Ms Rozhkova on Day 8; counsel for D2 cross-examined her on Day \n9. \n209  Counsel for D1 at one point commented, “ Ms Rozhkova, you have a certain mantra about things \nlike “key ratios ”: Howard KC, {Day8/69:19} - {Day8/70:10}  \nAA3/3/77\n75 \n supported D1’s Limitation Defence in particular that by December 2016, the NBU \nhad verified the Supply Agreement Fraud Allegations and briefed the New \nManagement on the potential cl aims in January 2017.   \n Iryna Hryn.  Ms Hryn is a Senior Lawyer in the Bank’s Legal Department. She and \nMr Valerii Bondarenko each made similar witness statements210 which were \ntendered as evidence that someone within the Bank who was not authorised to do \nso had filed a number of claims against the New Borrowers in late 2017 and had forged their signatures on the documentati on. That evidence was not challenged. \nMs Hryn gave evidence of steps the Bank took in 2017 to accelerate the debts under the New Loans and to issue proceedings against the New Borrowers before being instructed to stop that process.

While  both Ms Hryn and Mr Bondarenko were \nemployed by the Bank in 2014, neither of them  appear to have had any involvement \nin dealing with the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings  as they do not refer to them in their \nwitness statements.\n211 Ms Hryn was cross-examined by D1 and revealed that there \nwere a large number of senior lawyer s who were employed by the Bank after its \nnationalisation, who were also employed by the Bank in 2014 and whom the Bank \nhad not called to give evidence.212  \n Sergiy Oleksiyenko.  Mr Oleksiyenko is a member of the Supervisory Board of the \nBank and was appointed to that position upon the nationalisation of the Bank in \nDecember 2016. While he had not been directly employed by the Ministry of Finance at that time, his appointment was arranged by it.\n213 He made one witness \nstatement for the Bank.214 He was cross-examined by D1.215 He did indeed make \n“appropriate concessions ”216 – far more than the Bank is prepared to acknowledge. \nHis witness statement was drafted with th e Limitation Defence well in mind. It \n \n210  Hryn { B1/17 }; Bondarenko  {B1/11 } \n211  In Ms Hryn’s case, she explained she was ab sent from the Bank at the relevant time: Hryn \n{Day11/10:12-13}, {Day11/10:19-22}  \n212  As a result of her co-operation, it was no t necessary to cross-examine Mr Bondarenko. \n213  “ [M]y entry to the process which was done behind the scenes was through the Ministry of Finance” : \nOleksiyenko { Day10/26:14-19 } \n214  Oleksiyenko { B1/10 } \n215  Counsel for D1 cross-examined Mr Oleksiyenko on Days 10 and 11 with Ms Hryn being interposed \non Day 11. Counsel for D2 did not cross-examine Mr Oleksiyenko. \n216  Bank.Closing/224 {AA2/15/126}  \nAA3/3/78\n76 \n appears to have been designed to give th e impression that the new management of \nthe Bank was not focussed on the possibility of starting claims against D1 and that \na significant amount of investigation had been necessary before the Bank was able \nto understand the position. However, Mr Oleksiyenko had omitted vital information \nfrom his account. In particular, he had omitted to outline the facts and matters which the NBU had explained in a series of brie fings that took place in January 2017.

Ms Pakhachuk now occupies a senior role at the NBU,225 but \nat the time of making her w itness statement Ms Pakhachuk was an advisor to the \nChairman of the Bank’s Management Bo ard and was herself a member of the \nManagement Board between 23 December 2016 and 31 August 2021. She was working in the Ministry of Finance prio r to the nationalisation of the Bank and \nimmediately after the Bank’s nationalisa tion she was appointed Deputy Chairman, \nserving under Mr Oleksandr Shlapak, formerly  Ukraine’s Minister of Finance. Like \nMr Oleksiyenko, Ms Pakhachuk was tendere d as a witness with D1’s Limitation \nDefence in mind. Her witness statement focussed on the work that had been necessary in the early period of her appoi ntment, and the need for investigative \nwork although she provided little in th e way of detail. Th e Bank has missed the \npoint as it is prepared to submit that “ The questions did not advance the factual case \nbeyond her written evidence to any great extent. ”\n226 Like Mr Oleksiyenko’s the \nEnglish version of her witness statement had been drafted using the same words \nintended falsely to suggest that the facts and matters which were the subject of the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings merely “ touch on similar fact ual background to the \nEnglish claims ”.227 Her statement was translated by the interpreter during her cross-\nexamination as meaning “ The second document is a se t of court decisions of \nUkraine dated starting from November 2014,  which as far as I can judge, are \nrelated to the case similar to the claims in the English court ”.228 In cross-\nexamination, she accepted that she had also  read various news articles on joining \nthe Bank and that the scheme describe d in some detail them, based on the \nallegations in the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings, was the same as the scheme which is the subject of the proceedings.\n229 Ms Pakhachuk also accepted that she had been \naware in general terms of the invest igation being conducted by Mr Levadskiy.230 \nThe effect of her evidence, like Mr Ol eksiyenko’s evidence wa s that she had known \nabout the essential elements of the Bank’s claims in these proceedings since January \n \n225  Pakhachuk { Day12/12:25} - {Day12/13:2 } \n226  Bank.Closing/230 {AA2/15/129}  \n227  Pakhachuk/61 { B1/1/15 } \n228  Interpreter {Day12/40:1-16}  \n229  Pakhachuk {Day12/28:24}, {Day12/29:1}, {Day12/31:2-17}   \n230  Pakhachuk { Day12/53:13-19 } \nAA3/3/80\n78 \n 2017 and that proceedings could have been commenced against D1 at any time \nthereafter. \nF2(2)  Witnesses the Bank chose not to call \n What is particularly striking about the way in which the Bank has chosen to present \nits case is that, despite the prima facie  expiry of the limitation period in respect of \nmany of its claims before the issue of  these proceedings on 21 December 2017, it \nchose n"}

Thus in Mr Lewis’ first affidavit, sworn in support of the WFO \napplication, he addressed the potential Limitation Defence231 but prayed in \naid the possibility of its disapplication under Article 267(5) of the Civil Code. \n(2) At that time, Mr Lewis acknowledged232 that the Bank’s solicitors specifically \nrecognised the need for “ those concerned ” and the Bank’s Ukrainian lawyers \n(presumably referring to members of th e Bank’s legal department) to be \nconsulted in relation to the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings (and no doubt did in fact consult them before deciding which individuals to tender as witnesses of \nfact at trial).  \n(3) Many of the individuals whose knowledge might be relevant to the limitation \nissue remained at the Bank after the pr oceedings were issued and are still \neither employed by the Bank or by the NBU (so there would have been no \ndifficulty in tendering evidence from them). \n \n231  Lewis.Aff1/344-346 { H1/1/79 } \n232  Lewis.Aff1/275, fn 54 { H1/1/62 } referring to the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings, “ Although the Bank \nappears to have been a party to these Ukrainian proceedings, these issues have not been raised with \nthose concerned (nor, indeed, with the Bank’s then Ukrainian lawyers), since doing so risks the facts \nof the Bank’s case being leaked by those at the Bank who may be loyal to the First and Second \nDefendants …. ” \nAA3/3/81\n79 \n \n It is also the case that, although the Bank seeks to explain why it delayed \nproceedings, it did not call evidence from  a number of witnesses who were better \ninformed about what was being done in relation to the preparation of the claims than either Mr Oleksiyenko or Ms Pakhachuk (see Section F8(3)  below). \nF2(3)  Lack of evidence from the NBU \n The NBU has clearly been co-operating with the Bank throughout the litigation. \nThe Bank tendered evidence from Ms Domashenko, the NBU’s Curator in 2015 and from Ms Rozhkova, the Deputy Governor of the NBU who only joined the NBU in July 2015. Despite this, however: \n(1) The NBU was unwilling to assist the Bank with evidence from anyone as to \nwhat was known about the Bank a nd the Supply Agreement Fraud \nAllegations in 2014 or earlier. \n(2) The NBU refused to respond to requests to disclose documents relevant to the \nmatters in issue, even though request s were addressed to Ms Rozhkova\n233  \nwho was a Deputy Governor of the NBU and had volunteered a witness \nstatement to assist the Bank. She told the Court, “ I did not make any decision \nand even did not have any discussion [about] which documents should be or \nnot be provided .”234 \n(3) The Bank resisted attempts made by D1  to obtain disclosure of the NBU’s \ndocuments.235 \n It should be inferred from this that th e NBU’s documentary record would not \nsupport the case formulated by the Bank in these proceedings.  \n \n233  See Fieldfisher’s Request by letter dated 23.11.21 { L/23/1-5 } enclosing an earlier letter of 26.10.20  \n { L/24/1 } \n234  Rozhkova { Day8/56:9 } - {Day8/57:19 } \n235  Following correspo ndence on the issue { L/10.001.1.1 } {L/10.03.1 } {L/10.23.1 } {L/10.24.1 } \n{L/10.24.2 }, Lafferty9/41(e) { H2/27/13 } gave evidence as to the Ukrainian law position on \ndisclosure from the NBU.

UKRAINIAN LAW ON LIMITATION  \n The basic principles governing the operati on of the limitation pe riod are largely not \nin dispute. The following summary is sufficient. \nF3(1)  Date from which time runs  \n Under Article 261(1) of the Civil Code, “ The limitation period shall begin to run \nfrom the date on which a person became or could have become aware of a violation \nof his right or of the pe rson who violated such right .”236 \n Although there was a disagreement betw een the experts as to whether “ or” is to be \nread as meaning “ and”, that does not matter in this  case because it has not been \nsuggested that anyone other than D1 and D2 might have been considered \nresponsible.  \nF3(2)  What must be known  \n What must be known is the elements of the cause of action - so, in  the case of a tort \nclaim under Article 1166, (i) unlawfulness, (ii) harm and (iii) causat ion. (It is agreed \nthat the fourth element, fault, is presum ed so does not need to be known for time to \nstart running.) Mr Beketov confirmed this:237 \nQ. And in terms of what the knowledge or  belief must relate to, you say it must \nbe knowledge -- for what we’re talking about -- knowledge of the elements of the \ncause of action, in other words unlawfulness, harm and causation; correct? \nA. Yes. \n The rationale for this is, of course, that  a person who knows the elements of the \ncause of action is, by definition, in a position to file a claim with the court, so as to \nmake it appropriate for time to start running. The claimant  then has three years in \norder to gather any further information and evidence that may need to be put before \nthe court in order for a claim to succeed. Mr Beketov’s evidence was as follows:238 \n \n236  The Ukrainian Civil Code {C1/6/8} \n237  Beketov { Day27/18:9-14 } \n238  Beketov { Day27/18:15 } - {Day27/19:1 }; {Day27/19:5 } - {Day27/20:6 } \nAA3/3/83\n81 \n Q. Right. Now, once the claimant has awaren ess, once he knows or has a belief going \nbeyond mere speculation of the elements of the cause of action, as a matter of \nUkrainian law and procedure he is then in a position to identify them in a statement \nof claim and file the claim with the court; correct? \nA. Yes, in my evidence, in respect of tort , this should be knowledge sufficient to \nbring a claim. \nQ. Right. Yes, it’s knowledge -- when you say “to bring a claim”, it’s knowledge \nsufficient to issue your claim, your statement of claim? \nA. Yes. […] \n[Q.] Now, once you have the knowledge, the limitation period gives you three years \nto actually commence the proceedings; correct? \nA. Yes, correct. \nQ. So during that three years, of course, if one thinks about how a limitation period \n-- what their purpose is, one purpose is, we ’ve discussed, to create legal certainty? \nA. Yes. \nQ. Another thing it does, it gives the claimant time -- from when he has the awareness \nof the claim, it gives him three more years to, if he wants, obtain additional evidence \nin order to prove his claim in the end; correct? \nA. Yes, it is correct. \nQ. So I think it follows from everything we ’ve discussed so far, the claim document \nthat is filed with the court does not need to include the evidence that the claimant \nultimately relies on to prove the claim at the trial, does it? \nA. I believe it should have some evid ence but does not necessary ["}

Well, what it needs to do -- would you agree? -- is it needs to identify the facts \nwhich are essential to enable the claim to succeed?   \nA. Not all facts, but it should identify  facts which would be factual grounds for \nthe claim. \n \nF3(3)  Meaning of “knew”  \n A person will have actual knowledge of the re levant facts if he has a belief in those \nfacts which goes beyond mere speculation; in other words, a belief which is \nsupported by some evidence. Mr Beketov confirmed that there is no dispute:239 \n \n239  Beketov { Day27/17:15 } - {Day27/18:8 }, {Day27/19:20 } - {Day27/20:1 } \nAA3/3/84\n82 \n Q. […] I’m just asking you about the con cept of “awareness”. At the moment we’re \nnot looking at any facts of any case. Let’s see whether -- I think you agree with \nthis. Let’s have a look at {C6/1/145}, wh at you said at 377. You quoted Mrs Justice \nMoulder in the Tatneft case, which was referring to Russian law. You see the bit \nyou’ve quoted. You see in the first paragra ph her Ladyship said: “Accordingly, in \nmy view, ‘knowledge’ for this purpose is a belief that a violation of right has \noccurred which goes beyond mere speculation but knowledge is distinct from \nevidence and a claimant can have knowledge even though it does not have evidence \nwhich would prove the case at trial... ” I take  it that you agree with that statement? \nThere she was talking about the Russian Civil Code but you would apply the same view in relation to Ukrainian law; correct? \nA. Yes, correct. \n \nF3(4)  Meaning of “could have known”  \n There is a presumption that parties will “ exercise reasonable prudence and take a \nreasonable level of interest in the state of their affairs ”.240 Accordingly, Mr Beketov \nconfirmed that a party will have constructive knowledge if, taking that degree of interest, he could have di scovered the relevant facts:\n241   \nQ. So is this right? A person will be deem ed to have knowledge of the violation of \nhis rights if, using reasonable prudence and taking a reasonable level of interest in \nhis affairs, he or she could have become aware of the violation and, if necessary, the \nidentity of the defendant? \nA. Yes, it’s a test for construc tive knowledge under Ukrainian law. \n The Bank therefore rather distorts the te st in its favour where it suggests, at \nBank.Closing/575,242 that the question is whether “ the facts giving rise to the claim \nare so obvious that any reasonable person in the claimant’s position would have \nrealised them ” or “ the claimant was in default of a duty of care owed by him in not \nrealising them ”, neither of which is a formulatio n found in any Ukrainian decision.  \n \n240  UJS/100.2 {C5/1/39} . The presumption has been affirmed by the Supreme Court of Ukraine, in a \nlimitation context, in Case No. 912/3644/17 { C2/102/7 }: “Article 261 of the CC of Ukraine provides \nfor not only the possibility but also the obligation of the person to know about the state of its property \nrights, and therefore, proving the reason why the claimant did not know about the violation of its \ncivil right and for this re ason did not seek its protec tion in court is not enough .” \n241  Beketov { Day27/15:23 } - {Day27/16:5 } \n242  Bank.Closing/575 {AA2/15/307}  \nAA3/3/85\n83 \n F3(5)  Burden of proof  \n While it is unlikely that the Limitation Defence will turn on the burden of proof, \nthe position is that there is a shifting burden such that:  \n(1) A defendant who raises a limitation defen ce has to "}

Yes, and it corresponds balance of probabilities test.  But when raising \nlimitation defence, the defendant has to provide evidence that claimant either \nknew or could have known about limitation of his or her rights on a certain \ndate. \nQ. Is this right? In this country we have  what is sometimes called a “shifting burden” \n-- \nA. Yes. \nQ. -- and I think that’s what you may be talking about, and it’s really a matter of \ncommon sense. It starts off that the claimant doesn’t have to do anything about \nlimitation, step one; yes? \nA. Yes. \nQ. Step two, the defendant can raise the question and he has to provide some \nevidential basis for saying that the claimant should have known more than three \nyears -- knew or should have known more than three years ago; correct?  \nA. Correct.   \nQ. And if the defendant does that and has,  as it were, raised that initial question and \nevidence, then the burden shifts to the cl aimant to prove, “No, I didn’t have the \nrelevant knowledge more than three years ago”? \nA. Yes, correct. \nAA3/3/86\n84 \n \n The Bank says that in relation to cons tructive knowledge the burden of proof “ lies \non both parties ”:243 that is indeed what some cases say, and the meaning is as \nexplained above. As regards actual knowle dge the Bank says th e burden is on the \ndefendant only,244 but that is wrong: Mr Beketov expressly agreed that, if the \ndefendant discharges his evidential burden, the burden then shifts to the claimant \n“to in fact show that it didn’t know and couldn’t reasonably have discovered the \nfacts ”. \nF3(6)  Disapplication of the limitation period \n As noted above, a limitation period may be  disapplied under Article 267(5) of the \nCivil Code if it was missed owing to objective reasons beyond the claimant’s \ncontrol which prevented or si gnificantly hindered the filing of a claim in time. This \nprovision is addressed in more detail in Section F9  below. \nF4. FOUR BAD POINTS  \n Before addressing the core is sues in dispute as regard s limitation, it is convenient \nto dispose of four other arguments whic h the Bank has at various times made, or \nhinted it might make, as part of its res ponse to the Limitation Defence, but which \nare plainly misconceived.  \nF4(1)  Denying fraud and relying on a limitation defence \n Contrary to a suggestion made by the Bank in opening,245 and recapitulated in its \nClosing Submissions,246 there is no inconsistenc y between a defendant denying \nliability for fraudulen t conduct and at the same time advancing a limitation defence \ncontending that the claimant knew or ought to  have known of the fraud at an earlier \ndate than it claims to have done. \n \n243  Bank.Closing/573 {AA2/15/306} \n244  Bank.Closing/571 {AA2/15/306} \n2"}

In th e case of a claim alleging a fraud which \nis denied, the limitation defence is eval uated on the assumption that there was \na fraud, as identified by the claimant in the way in which he pleads his case.248 \n(3) Consequently, while it may seem para doxical that a defendant should dispute \nthe claimant’s assertion that he coul d not have known or discovered a fact \nwhich, in relation to the merits of the claim, the defendant denies is a fact at all: \n“There is in reality no paradox, becau se at the stage of an inquiry into \nlimitation the existence of the cause of action, and therefore the truth of the facts relied on by the claimant to establis h it, is not the relevant issue. Put in \ngeneral terms, the question is not whet her the claimant could have established \nhis cause of action more than six years (or whatever other limitation period \nmight be relevant) before he issued his claim, but whether he could have \ncommenced proceedings more than six y ears before he issued his claim. The \nexistence of the constituents of the cause of action - such as fraud or mistake - as verified facts is not the issue.” \n See also Tatneft v Bogolyubov  [2021] EWHC 411 (C omm) at [23]-[25],249 where \nMoulder J rejected a submission that the defendants were guilty of “ brazen \nhypocrisy ” in raising a limitation defence as being wrong in principle, and found \nthe claim to be time-barred.  \n \n247  FII Group {M2/13.1}  \n248  FII Group  [199] {M2/13.1/90}  \n249  Tatneft v Bogolyubov  [2021] EWHC 411 (Comm) at [23]-[25] {M3/6/5}  \nAA3/3/88\n86 \n F4(2)  Public policy \n In its Reply, the Bank pleads that if the Court finds that the limitation period expired \nbefore 21 December 2017, the three-year limitation period should be disapplied \nand/or extended pursuant to section 2(1)  of the Foreign Limitations Periods Act \n1984 and/or in accordance with Article 26 of Rome II.250 \n The suggestion that the Ukrainian law of  limitation should offend public policy is \na surprising one for a Claimant owned by th e Ukrainian State to be making. In any \nevent, it is obviously wrong.   \n First, English law itself does not guarantee that a claimant will always be able to \nbring its claim before it becomes time-barred, so the risk that a foreign limitation period might have that result can hardly be said to conflict with English public \npolicy.

Similarly, it is an area which \nthrows up another, familiar, tension: on th e one hand, it is desirable to have general \nand clear rules about limitation, even if they occasionally appear to produce a harsh \nresult; on the other hand, it is sometimes a ppropriate to have specific exceptions to \navoid too many unfairnesses. I see no particular policy reasons for adopting either interpretation in the present case, as each of them seems to me to result in a \ndefensible and a ppropriate outcome. \n ൯൯. Seventhly, and connected with the si xth point, there is the alleged unfairness \non a potential pursuer if time runs against him from the date he knows of the injury, \neven though he may not know of the identity of the person who caused the injury or what the cause of the injury  was. In my view, the legislature could perfectly \nreasonably have assumed that in almost every case, five years from the date of \ndiscovery of loss, injury or damage woul d represent plenty of time for the injured \nparty to discover all he needs to know to bring proceedings. The fact that there may \nbe a very rare case where five years may not be enough is simply an example of the \ninevitable consequence of the compromise wh ich limitation law involves. After all, \n \n250  Reply/23.3 { A1/25/29 }; see also Bank.Opening/515 { AA2/1/203 } \n251  Morrison v ICL Plastics  [2014] UKSC 48 at [54]-[55] {M2/6.9/17}  \nAA3/3/89\n87 \n even under the interpretation favoured by Lord Hodge there could be potential \nunfairnesses in individual and unusual cases,  sometimes to pursuers and sometimes \nto defenders .\" \n Secondly, English law recognises that different states may reasonably make \ndifferent rules in relation to limitation and that the mere fact that a foreign limitation \nrule is stricter than the corresponding E nglish rule comes nowhere near establishing \na violation of public policy. As Leggatt J said in Alseran v Ministry of Defence  \n[2017] EWHC 3289 (QB) at [827]:252 \n“Private international law is founded on principles of comity and mutual respect and \non the recognition that in many areas of law different approaches may be reasonably \ntaken. That is obviously true in the field of limitation law, which involves striking a \nbalance between allowing claimants to  assert their legal rights and protecting \ndefendants against stale claims. Different legal systems may legitimately strike this \nbalance in different ways. An English cour t should for this reason be very slow to \nsubstitute its own view for the solution adopted by the foreign legislature.” \n Thirdly, and in any event, there is not hing harsh about the Ukrainian rules of \nlimitation which apply in this case. A th ree-year limitation period is unremarkable \nand plainly not unfair in itself, as the Bank accepts.253  And any potential harshness \nis mitigated by the existence of a discreti on to disapply the limitation period if the \nclaimant is prevented or significantly hindered from filing its claim in time by \nfactors beyond its control. That is a perf ectly fair and balanced scheme, and cannot \nseriously be contended to ra ise any public policy concerns.254 Indeed it is \nimpossible to see how the Court can conclude  that English public  policy is offended \nif it has also concluded that there is no basis on which to disapply the limitation \nperiod under Article 267(5): the facts on which D1 relie s i"}

The existence of a three-year limitation period, \ntogether with a discretion to disapply the limitation period where there are valid reasons to do so, is more than a sufficien t guarantee of fairness for the purposes of \nArticle 6(1): no authority be gins to suggest otherwise.\n256 The Court therefore \nsimply has to apply the provisions of the Civil Code in accordance with their terms: \nany “ human rights gloss ” is unnecessary and inappropriate.   \nF4(4)  D1 should be permitted to rely on the constructive knowledge of the \nBank \n The Bank contends that it is not open to D1  to rely on the Bank having constructive \nknowledge sufficient for the limitation period to start running.257 The Bank claims \nthat only actual knowledge was pleaded but that is wrong.  \n In his Defence,258 D1 pleads that both actual  and constructive knowledge is \nsufficient under Article 261 (“ became aware or could have become aware ”) and \nthat the Bank knew of the facts and matters on which its claim is based before December 2014. In that context, relian ce is clearly placed on knowledge whether it \nis actual or constructive. \n In any event, the Bank did in fact have actual awareness of the facts and this can be \ndemonstrated as a matter of fact in the case of some relevant individuals and as a matter of inference in relation to others on the basis that they are bound to have \n \n255  Alyoshin { Day30/51:21 } - {Day30/55:5 } \n256  While it is right, as the Bank’s counsel put to Mr Alyoshin, that the ECtHR has said that rules of \nlimitation must not be applied with “ excessive formalism ”, it has in the same breath underlined that \ncourts must also avoid “ excessive flexibility such as would render nugatory the procedural \nrequirements laid down in statutes ”: see e.g. Esim v Turkey , Application No. 59601/09, 17 \nDecember 2013 at [21] {M2/6.8/7}  \n257  Bank.Closing/565 {AA2/15/303}  \n258  Defence/84-86 {A1/8/49}  \nAA3/3/91\n89 \n investigated and discovered certain matters.

[…] in my view a Ukrainian court would likely take a common sense \napproach to determining how and unde r what circumstances the knowledge of \na natural person associated with a company will be attributed to that company. \nThis would, in my view, entail the court considering all the specific circumstances of the case to determine wh ether, as a matter of fact, the company \nshould be found to have the knowledge that  a particular natural person has been \nfound to have. \n൫൱൱. In this regard, I consider that a Ukrainian court would likely place \nsignificant weight upon the degree to which the person whose knowledge is sought to be attributed to a company was in a position to exercise influence \nover the management or business of the company, whether through formal or \ninformal means. \n൫൱൲. In the context of a bank, prima facie those in a position to exercise such \ninfluence would in my view likely include any individual who qualifies as: \na) an ‘executive’ (or ‘manager’) of the bank […] \nb) an ‘officer’ (or ‘official’) of the bank […]” \n(4) But in the specific context of limitation Mr Beketov wrote that:  \n“it is the knowledge of the management body with the authority to bring a claim \nthat should matter”278  \nand that:  \n“the knowledge of members of the Bank’ s Management Board would be more \nlikely to be considered relevant for purposes of limitation th an the knowledge \nof members of its Supervisory Board, because…the Bank’s Management Board, and not its Supervisory Board,  appears to have had the power to \n \n276  Beketov Supplemental Report in Avonwick /106 {C9.15/1/27} \n277  Beketov8/176-178 {C1/1/58} \n278  Beketov8/297 {C1/1/95} \nAA3/3/96\n94 \n authorise the instruction of third part y legal advisors and commenc"}

That evidence was however inconsistent not only with all his \nprevious reports but was also internally inconsistent so as to be impossible to \nunderstand. Mr Beketov said that: \n“In my view, in respect of any period of time during which the Bank’s \nSupervisory Board (and General Meeting of Shareholders) had the exclusive \npower to take a “decision on holding the officials of the Bank’s management \nbodies personally liable”, a Ukrainian c ourt would consider the knowledge of \nmembers of the Supervisory Board (and Ge neral Meeting of Shareholders), and \nnot its Management Board, to be relevant … This is because, during that period, \nthe power to decide whether to bring su ch claims rested exclusively with the \nSupervisory Board (and General Meeti ng of Shareholders), and it is the \nknowledge of those persons authorised to  decide whether the Bank will bring a \nclaim that is primarily  relevant to consider when applying a common sense \napproach […] \nwhen the ൬൪൫൱ Charters were in effect, the position would be as set out in \nBeketov ൲/൭൪൲-൭൬൭, i.e. it would be the knowledge of members of the Bank’s \nManagement Board that would in my view be primarily  relevant”.280 \n(6) In response to a question from the Court, Mr Beketov confirmed that he \nintended to say in paragraph 8 that “ a Ukrainian court would consider the \nknowledge of members of the Supervisory Board to be primarily  relevant ”, in \norder to be consistent with his later statements:281  \nMR JUSTICE TROWER: Can I just ask one question? I have your evidence \non this point, but if one goes back to paragraph 8 of the 13th report – \nA. Yes, my Lord. \nMR JUSTICE TROWER: -- you use the word “relevant” in two places, one \nin the fifth line and then one in the third -last line, and you put “primarily” \nbefore “relevant” in the third -last line but you don’t put it before “relevant” in \nthe fifth line.

Mr Howard, I believe I use “primar ily” in this context because I refer to \nthe knowledge of corporate body of specific legal entity who has power to bring the claim. So when you assess issue of attribution, in the first place, you \nshould look at this issue. But you are right, my evidence is that attribution of knowledge is not limited only to the corporate body. \n \n Mr Beketov also expressly accepted that atte mpting to confine the circle of relevant \npeople to those who were empowered to br ing legal proceedings  would be wrong:  \nQ.

That would be wrong, wouldn’t it? \nA. I would say that as a matter of principle it would not be advisable. \n \n It follows from this that the evidence of the experts as to whether the power to bring \nlegal proceedings against D1 was in fact  reserved to the supervisory board under \nthe Bank’s Charter at the relevant time, or  whether it rested with the management \n \n282  Beketov {Day27/39:16} - {Day27/40:4} \nAA3/3/98\n96 \n board at all times, is neither determina tive of anything nor even (as the Bank now \nsays)283 a “highly relevant consideration ”, and the Court need not consider or \nresolve it.  \n The true position – as Mr Beketov also accepted – is that the knowledge of any \ncompany officer or employee will be attrib uted to the company if they acquire (or \ncould have acquired) the knowledge in th e performance of their duties or if the \nknowledge is relevant to the performance of their duties:284  \nQ. Okay. So where we get to is if an of ficer or employee of the Bank learns about \na violation of the Bank’s rights in the course of performing their duties on behalf of the Bank or where the violation of the Bank’s rights is relevant to the performance of their duties, then, as a matter of common sense, that either must or \nat least may fall to be attributed to the Bank; correct? \nA. As a matter of common sense, I would say “may” – \nQ. Yes. \nA. -- because it has to be assessed give n all factual circumstances of a \nparticular case. \nQ. I’m not quite sure I understand that, when you say the “factual circumstances \nof a particular case”. Let’s just test it. If we take a person who is a member of the \nmanagement board -- okay? \nA. Yes. \nQ. Now, let’s leave aside for the mome nt whether the management board has \nauthority to authorise the commencement of  proceedings. Let’s leave that dispute \non one side. If such a person learns about a violation of the Bank’s rights -- and \nassume they’re not part of the wrongdoing. They’re a perfectly honest, proper \nperson -- as a matter of common sense, their knowledge would normally be attributed to the company, wouldn’t it? \nA. Yes. \nQ. If we take someone who is not a member of the management board but occupies \na senior position -- we’ll look at some for a moment -- I think your evidence is that \ntheir knowledge can be attributed to the Bank as a matter of common sense.

So in this particular case what we have is that the first and second defendants \n-- but let’s take Mr Kolomoisky -- he is said, through a loan scheme -- he is said to \nhave siphoned very large funds from the Bank using borrowers and sham supply \nagreements as described in the particul ars of claim which you’re familiar with; \ncorrect? \nA. Yes. \nQ. Right. So that’s the alleged wrongdoing. Now, I just want to consider various \npeople who may or may not -- I ’m not asking you whether they knew the facts, but \nlooking at their position for a moment as to whether they fall within the class of people who, against that factual backgr ound, are capable of having their knowledge \nattributed. Now, I think the thing is we first -- what we agree is that members of the \nmanagement committee, if they know a bout it, assuming they’re not fraudsters \n \n285  Bank.Closing/580(2) {AA2/15/310} \n286  See Libyan Arab Investment Authority v Credit Suisse [2021] EWHC 2684 (Comm) at [34] \n{M2/12.1/11} , per HHJ Pelling QC: “ there is no reason why the knowledge of non-wrong-doing \ndirectors or agents of the LIA should not be attributed to the LIA on the conventional basis that they \nowe a duty (in this case to the LIA) to report relevant knowledge about its affairs ”. \nAA3/3/100\n98 \n themselves or involved, their knowledge as a matter of common sense falls to be \nattributed to the Bank? \nA. Yes. […] \nQ. So [at Beketov8/208287] you identify members of the supervisory board and the \nmanagement board, then “members of [the] audit commission, the company’s \ninternal auditor, and members of any other body provided for in the company’s \ncharter”. So if we take firstly members of the audit commission, I think it’s also \ncalled the “Audit Committee”, if, in the course of your duties on the Audit Committee, you learn about the violation of the Bank’s rights in the form of Mr Kolomoisky siphoning funds out of the Bank via loans, purported loans, to companies he controls and sham supply agreements as described in these \nproceedings, that would obviously be releva nt to the performance of your duties on \nthe Audit Committ"}

I assume that it should be.   \nQ. Yes. So I think you would agree that , as a matter of common sense, if members \nof the Audit Committee learn of these fact s and assuming they are not themselves \ninvolved, that knowledge would be attributed to the company? \nA. As a matter of common sense, their knowledge may be attributable to the \ncompany, but, again, knowledge is a matter of fact under Ukrainian law. […] \n[Q.] Well, I’ll just go through va rious other people and let’s just see -- I’ll go through \na list rather than going too slowly. The ch ief accountant and head of the internal \naudit, they are presumably people who you would say are in a similar position to \nmembers of the Audit Committee, so if they  learnt the facts, potentially they are \npeople whose knowledge would fall to be attributed? \nA.

Yes -- potentially, yes, because again it would be a matter of fact to find \nwhether attribution took or did not take place. \nQ. Yes, and you would also I think agree that the head of the finance and risk \ndepartment, head of the compliance depa rtment, they would also be people who \npotentially -- if they acquired the knowledge, that  their knowledge would fall to be \nattributed? \nA. If they’re considered officials of the Bank under JSC Law or officers under \nthe law of the Bank, potentially their knowledge may be also relevant. \n \n287  Beketov8/208 {C1/1/69} \nAA3/3/101\n99 \n Q. Let me ask you then about the -- let’s take someone who is, say, the head of the \nlegal department. Now, assume the head of the legal department, as a result of \nbecoming involved in handling claims which took place in Ukraine in 2014 in court -- if the head of the legal department, as a result of that, learnt of the violation of the \nBank’s rights in the form that we’ve discussed , again, that would obviously be highly \nrelevant, wouldn’t it, to the h ead of legal department’s job? \nA. It would be because I assume he has to report to the board. \nQ. Yes. So his knowledge is, again, you would say -- and indeed of other people in \nthe legal department learning these facts -- is capable as a matter of common sense \nof being attributed to the company? \nA. As you said with before example, po tentially his knowledge may be relevant. \nF6.

This is when an \nunidentified informant (or inform ants) within the Bank (the “ Whistleblower ”) of \nsufficient seniority to persuade the GPO to open an investigation learned of the facts \nand matters supporting the Supply Agreemen t Fraud Allegations and reported them \nto both the GPO and Glavcom.

That knowledge was no-doubt based \non the allegations made in the proceedings served on the Bank (the “ 2014 \nUkrainian Proceedings ”) between September and October 2014 and the loan \nagreements, pledge agreements and supply agreements referred to in them but there is no reason to believe that the Whistleblower’s knowledge was confined to those matters.  \n There is no reason to suspect that the Whistleblower had not taken into account \nsuch Share Pledges as were then in existence:  \n(1) It was no secret that the companies whos e shares had been pledged to secure \nthe loans were companies owned and/or controlled by D1 and/or D2;  \nAA3/3/102\n100 \n (2) As such, whatever the value of the comp anies may have been at any particular \npoint in time,288 there was no guarantee that the Share Pledges would remain \nvaluable if anyone tried to enforce them, as assets could be removed from the companies whose shares had been pledged before any enforcement action was taken.\n289  \n D1 relies on the fact that the Bank mu st know who the Whistleblower was but has \nchosen not to reveal their identity as th e basis on which an adverse inference should \nbe drawn that it was someone sufficiently  senior within the Bank whose knowledge \nis to be attributed to it. \n If the Court does not accept that the knowledge of the Whistleblower was sufficient \nto start time running, then D1 relies on the fact that the Bank acquired actual \nknowledge of the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings  through its Legal Department in the \ncourse of September and October 2014 and that its Management Board, Credit Committee Members and other Senior Mana gers outside the Legal Department \nacquired actual knowledge of the Suppl y Agreement Fraud Allegations by the \nmiddle of November 2014 as a result of the facts and ma tters published in Glavcom. \nIt is to be inferred that all senior manage rs complied with their duty to investigate \nand discovered more facts and matters about the fraud within a short period of time. \nAgain, like the Whistleblower, they would have concluded that the loans were all \nfor the benefit of companies owned and/or controlled by D1 and/or D2 and were inadequately secured.  \n It is unsatisfactory that, having recogni sed the need to make enquiries of “ those \nconcerned ” and members of its own legal department,290 in due course and being \n \n288  The Share Pledges appear to have been recognised as valuable by the Bank’s Auditors, PwC when \nconcluding that the Bank’s loan book was adequately secured. \n289  An email sent by Ms Shetsova to Mr Linsky on 29.07.14 {E4/188} , referring to NBU inspectors as \nthe “ auditors ”, informed him that the NBU, “ the auditors completely refused to take into account \nthe proprietary rights to securities.

Only the Relevant Supplie rs were named as respondents \nto the Arbitration claims and so the Bank was not served with proceedings. \n The Bank contends that the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings and the Arbitration Claims \nwere issued “ to cover up the Misappropriation and evade scrutiny from the \nNBU ”.303  Whether or not that was the inten tion, they did nothing of the sort. On \nthe contrary, the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings  had precisely the opposite effect. Not \nonly did the receipt of claims by the Bank reveal the violation of the Bank’s rights \nto people within the Bank who did not already know about it, but, when judgments \n \n301  See Agreed Chronology { AA1/4 } \n302  Namely Gardera { F124/38 }, Nautis-Trade { F123/60 } and Tamersa { F123/36 } \n303  Bank.Opening/2(6) { AA2/1/8 }. The Bank states that the Judgments “ were no more than pieces of \npaper that could be shown to the regulator or auditor if they asked why the Unreturned Prepayments \nwere outstanding and in order to avoid the Borrowers incurring punitive charges under Ukrainian foreign currency control regulations.” : see the table at Bank.Opening/31, entry 2 “September-\nNovember 2014” { AA2/1/23 } \nAA3/3/106\n104 \n were issued, they were reported on th e Unified Register of Court decisions304 which \nwas a publicly accessible305 source of information.  \n It was obvious from the Borrowers’ Statements of Claim306 filed in the 2014 \nUkrainian Proceedings, when these were considered together, that something was wrong. Each of six Suppliers had written to a number of Borrowers explaining that it was not able to supply the goods they had ordered. These letter s were all sent at \naround the same time.

But the Judgment is not the most relevant event; people within the Bank would \nhave known about all the claims by the time the last was issued and served upon it; anyone \nsufficiently senior reading the Glavcom Article could have made enquiries of the Bank’s legal \ndepartment. \n307  For example, Trade Point Agro contracted to provide PET, RBD Palm Oil and apple juice \nconcentrate: { F1/90/1 }  \n308  Rozhkova { Day8/32:6-10 } \n309  Glavcom Article { E7/8 } \nAA3/3/107\n105 \n \n When asked to tell the Court what Glav com was, Ms Rozhkova suggested that it \nwas like “The Sun” media in the UK.310 The Sun is the most widely read news \nsource in the UK.311 Glavcom is one of the most widely read news sources in \nUkraine.312 \n Glavcom identified 30 of the Relevant Borrowers by name and all six of the \nDefendant Suppliers.313 It did not identify any borrowers who are not identified as \nRelevant Borrowers by the Ba nk in these proceedings.  \n Glavcom identified links between some of the Relevant Borrowers and the Bank or \nD1,314 referring to information solely within the public domain:315  \n“The fact is that many PrivatBank \"would-be-borrowers” have many things in \ncommon with the Privat Group of the Dn ipropetrovsk businessman.

WAS TIME PREVENTED FROM RUNNING WHILE D1 CONTROLLED THE BANK?   \n One of the Bank’s responses to the Lim itation Defence is to claim that the \nknowledge of its officers could not be attri buted to it while D1 remained in control \nof the Bank, because as a practical  matter the Bank could not commence \nproceedings during that period.402 There is, however, no ba sis for this argument, \nwhich is contrary to  the clear scheme laid out in  the Civil Code, and wrong in \nprinciple:  \n(1) The point at which time starts to run unde r Article 261(1) is the date when the \nclaimant first acquires knowledge (actua l or constructive) of its cause of \naction.

In  most cases the date of knowledge and \nthe ability to bring a claim will coin cide but Article 261(1) is strictly \nconcerned with the former and not the latter.  \n(3) This is clear from the terms of Article  261 as a whole, which clarifies when \nthe limitation period starts to run for some specific types of claim. In particular:  \n(a) Article 261(2) provides that for claims to invalidate transactions made \nunder duress, time runs from the date  when the duress ceases to exist. \n \n402  Anderson KC { Day4/38:14 } - {Day4/39:6 } \nAA3/3/124\n122 \n It is irrelevant whether or not the claimant is prevented from filing its \nclaim, as a practical matter, for other reasons.  \n(b) A similar analysis applies to Ar ticle 261(3) (claims to apply the \nconsequences of a void transac tion), Article 261( 4) (claims for \nviolations of a minor’s rights), Article 261(5) (claims accruing on a \ncertain date or on the presentation of a demand), and Article 261(6) (claims against sureties etc.). In non e of these cases is the start of the \nlimitation period tied to the question whether the claimant has the \npractical ability to bring a claim.  \n(4) Any other interpretation would lead to  significant uncertainty, and thereby \nundermine the agreed purpose of the limita tion period, given that it will often \nbe difficult to determine whether a clai mant did or did not have the practical \nability to start proceedings at a specific point in time  (whether for reasons of \ncorporate control or other reasons), and thus to ca lculate the limitation period \nwith accuracy.  \n Nor does Mr Beketov’s evidence suppor t the Bank’s case in this regard:  \n(1) Mr Beketov suggested in hi s WFO report in 2017 that “ arguably ” time did \nnot begin to run until the Bank was nationalised.403 But he did not repeat that \nsuggestion in his expert re port for trial (Beketov8),404 no doubt because he \nappreciated that – whether arguable  or not – it was not correct.  \n(2) Later, in his supplemental report, he said for the first time that:  \n“where a company is defrauded by its former management, which is then \nremoved and replaced by new manageme nt, a Ukrainian Court determining \nwhen the defrauded company acquired k nowledge sufficient to start limitation \nrunning is likely to conclude that th is will only be once the new management \nhas had a reasonable period of time to investigate the fraud and uncover \ninformation and evidence sufficient to allow a claim to be brought”.405 \n \n403  Beketov1/143(b) (CMC Bundle {D/27/42} ) \n404  Beketov8 {C1/1}  \n405  Beketov9/401 { C6/1/155 } \nAA3/3/125\n123 \n (3) But this does not support the proposition for which the Bank contends: \n(a) It is common ground that the knowledge of a fraudster will not be \nattributed to a company.406 So, if the company had been defrauded by \nits former management and no other officers or employees knew about \nthe fraud then there would be no kno wledge which coul d be attributed \nto the company and time would not have started running. \n(b) In that situation, the company would only acquire knowledge when the \nnew management acquired, or shou ld have acquired, knowledge of a \nviolation of its rights. \n(c) In other words, all Mr Beketov was effectively saying was that if the \nnew management does not have actua l knowledge of the violation of \nthe company’s rights, they will ac quire constructive knowledge of it \nwithin a reasonable time.

This is not disputed. \n There is also no court practic e supporting the Bank’s approach: \n(1) The only case cited by Mr Beketov in c onnection with the view he expressed \nat Beketov9/408 was the first instance judgment in Tavryka Bank .407 But \nthat judgment (which would hardly be a strong authority in any case) does \nnot even bear out the limited and unc ontroversial proposition advanced by Mr \nBeketov; still less does it  support the Bank’s argument that no attribution is \npossible on the facts of this case.  \n(2) The facts of the case were that the NB U appointed a liquidator over a bank in \nMarch 2013. In September 2013 the liquida tor concluded an inventory of the \nbank’s assets. The court found that the limitation period had started to run in \nSeptember, when the liquidator first knew that the bank’s assets were \ninsufficient to pay its creditors. (As it happened, the claim was not brought \nuntil 2018 and so was time-barred in a ny event.) The case says nothing about \n \n406  ULJS/110.3 {C5/1/43} \n407  Tavryka Bank {C9.8/43} . The relevant passage is at p.42. \nAA3/3/126\n124 \n attribution of knowledge or whether or not a limitation period can be deferred \non account of a fraudster’s control.  \n(3) There are other cases, not referred to by Mr Beketov in this context, such as \nAgrocomplex ,408 where the Supreme Court has stated that the start of the \nlimitation period runs from “ the emergence of the interested party’s right to \nsue, i.e. the [ability/possibility ]409 to enforce their right  through the court ”. \nThis simply reflects the fact that the “ emergence of the right to sue ” will \nnormally coincide with the practical abil ity or possibility to do so; but what \nmatters is when the claimant could have sued in principle: there is no case where a Ukrainian court has held that, although the claimant or one of its \nrepresentatives had knowledge of the cau se of action, nevertheless time did \nnot begin to run until the claimant ha d a practical opportunity to bring its \nclaim. \n Moreover, there is no need to distort th e plain meaning of Article 261(1) as the \nBank seeks to do, because the Civil Code provides a “ safety valve ” in Article 267(5) \nfor claimants who miss the limitation peri od for valid reasons. Where a claimant \nclaims to have been unable practically to  bring its claim in time, whether because \nit was under the control of a wrongdoer or fo r other reasons, such arguments can be \ntaken into account in the exercise of th e court’s discretion under Article 267(5). \n Accordingly, the Bank’s attempt to defer the start of the limitation period until after \nD1 was removed from his position must be rejected: it is misconceived in principle \nand not supported by any evidence or authority whatsoever. \nF8.

Potentially, yes. \n \n Finally, although no expert expressly addres sed this point, in considering whether \nthe Bank had a reasonable or sufficient opportu nity to bring its claim it must be \nrelevant to take into account its size, sophistication and access to legal resources. \nThus in the Avonwick  case, for example, Picken J declined to exercise the \ndiscretion under Article 267(5) in favour of a party who was “ a sophisticated \nbusinessman and would, as such, be an unlikely beneficiary of a decision to \ndisapply ”.417 \nF8(2)  Application to the facts  \n Applying these principles, there can be no doubt that  the Bank had a sufficient \nopportunity to bring its cl aim before time expired in October/November 2017 and \ncould with reasonable diligence have done so . The fact that it did not do so was not \nbecause it was “ prevented or significantly hindered ” by any external circumstances \nbut was simply due to its own choices as  to how – and where – to proceed. The \ndiscretion to disapply th e limitation period under Ar ticle 267(5) is therefore \nunavailable.  \nF8(2)(a)  2014 – December 2016 \n The fact that the Bank was engaged in hi gh-risk lending to related parties who had \nnot been identified by the Bank as such was well known to the NBU following an \naudit of the period between 2011 and 2014 which took place between May and August 2014. In particular , the NBU knew that the Bank’s loan book involved \n“significant credit concentrations (includi ng with insiders), violating credit risk \nratios and reducing regulatory capital ”; that loans were provided to “ newly created \n \n417  Avonwick {M3/4/161} at [755] \nAA3/3/130\n128 \n companies with almost no activity ” and secured by “ high share of low-liquidity \ncollateral ” – “80% of the collateral accepted by the Bank  for calculating loan \nimpairment provisions was rights to after- acquired goods to be delivered at a later \ndate”.418   \n As noted in Section F6(2)(c)  above, the NBU learned about the Supply Agreement \nFraud Allegations no later than early N ovember 2014 when the Chairman of the \nNBU was interviewed by LigaBusiness Inve st within a few days of the Glavcom \nArticle being published.   \n"}

No disclosure of relevant doc uments has been produced by the Bank or \nby the NBU. Nevertheless, it appears that a strategy was being developed to recover \nlosses from D1 in case that restructuring fa iled and the Bank had to  be nationalised:  \n \n421  EY Report 16 July 2015 { E17/242 } \n422  Rozhkova { Day8/59:19 } \n423  See D1 Day 6 Handout { AA6/7/1 }, detailing the NBU’s categorisa tion of Borrowers pursuant to \nArticle 52 of the Law on Banks as amended by Law 218-VIII on 2 March 2015.

The NBU wrote to the Bank to \nrequest a recapitalis ation plan on 21 January 2016, and obtained a personal \nguarantee from D1 on 4 February 2016. A day later, the NBU instructed \nKroll427 to search for assets owned by D1 in case of a shortfall in the Bank’s \nfunds. After further requests from the NBU, the Bank submitted a Restructuring Plan on 12 February  2015, which was approved by the NBU \non 23 February 2016. It is surely no coin cidence that Mr Hardman attended a \nthird meeting with the President’ s advisors on 15 February 2016.\n428  \n(3) On 1 July 2016, the NBU produced an audit report429 which made detailed \nfindings as to a “ scheme-based and sham ” corporate portfolio which served \nto raise funds for parties related to the bank, involving loans to unprofitable \nborrowers (including some Relevant Borrowers) secured by “ fictitious ” \ncollateral. Three days later, on 4 Ju ly 2016, the NBU engaged Alix Partners430 \nto investigate loans issued by the Bank in favour of D1. \n The Bank argues that while D1 was in control of the Bank it could not bring \nproceedings against him. That may be true and although the NBU could have intervened at any time after learning of the Supply Agreement Fraud allegations in \nNovember 2014, it did not nationalise the Bank until December 2016.

At \nthat time there were 10 or 11 months left  to bring a claim but  the Bank chose to \ndelay bringing any proceedings while it con tinued its efforts to negotiate with D1. \nF8(2)(b)  The NBU’s initial attempts to ca use D1 to recapitalise the Bank \n Applying stress tests, the NBU determined that the Bank’s capital adequacy ratios \nwere too low.

We were, all of us, coming to the \nBank with fresh eyes and, although some had come from public service positions where they had some prior interaction with  the Bank, many of us – myself included \n– had until very recently only followed events  at the Bank through what was reported \nin the press. There was a process of on-boa rding involving the Mi nistry of Finance \nand the National Bank of Ukraine (the “NBU”), but that was fairly limited: it \nconsisted of a small number of presentati ons, from which we were not permitted to \ntake copies of the underlying materials.

Correct. \nQ. Those were allegations which I imagine you, as somebody at that stage in \nFebruary 2015 who wasn't -- you weren't involved in Privat, but they were \nallegations which I imagine you would have found of interest, bearing in mind that \nPrivatBank was a bank of systemic importance and so on. \nA. That's correct. \nQ. Yes. So this is not something that -- when you come to November/December \n2016 and you're being invited to join this  board, the supervisory board, you hadn't \nforgotten about that, had you? \nA. With the -- I didn't remember details of the legal entities, size of the \ncontracts and details of the individual  loan and supply agreements, but in \ngeneral the scheme was in the recollection and I remembered it. \nQ. Yes. Perfectly understandable that you would not remember the specific details \nof the companies and the agreement numbers and so on, but the thrust of what had \nbeen said, namely that Mr Kolomoisky  had misappropriated or procured the \nmisappropriation of 1.8 billion via this scheme, you had that well in mind; right? \nA. Yes. \nQ. Yes. So you also knew -- even if you couldn't remember the detail, you knew \nthat the detail was set out in that Our Money article? \nA. Yes, and I think most likely this ar ticle in the original also had a cross-\nreference to it.  \n \n470  Oleksiyenko {Day10/81:3}  {Day10/82:14}  \nAA3/3/140\n138 \n  \n And later:471 \nQ. ...So you were fully aware of the fact -- it's very important that we're clear and \nprecise -- you were fully aware of the fact, if we take the position -- I'm taking it at 23 December because that's the date of this article[\n472] -- you were fully aware \no"}

Yes. \nQ. First thing. Second thing: you were fu lly aware of the fact that the scheme of \nthe misappropriation – the procurement of the misappropriation was alleged to be \nfunds being lent to borrowers, controlled by them, which funds in turn go to the \nsix suppliers; correct? \nA. Yes. \nQ. Thirdly, you were also aware of the fact that there were judgments of the \nUkrainian court which set out the terms of  the supply contracts, which terms the \njournalists said were obvious shams; correct? \nA. Yes. \n \n And further:473  \nQ. Right. What I'm interested in and I thi nk where we get to is, firstly, at the date \nwhen you and your colleagues come into th e Bank, you are fully aware of the fact \nthat the NBU has in fact itself -- we've see n what the journalists say, so we'll leave \nthat on one side.  We've now got what the NBU is saying about the borrowers and the suppliers. You're fully aware of the fact that the NBU is satisfied and has determined that the borrowers and suppliers , insofar as they have been listed in the \ndocuments, were related parties of the shar eholders, being used to transit funds on \nbehalf of the shareholders or siphon funds to them; correct? \nA. This is correct, but, my Lord, I would want to stress that the revelation \nthat NashiGroshi article list of companies and related parties list of companies in full was produced only in December 2016, not earlier. \nQ. Right. \n \n471  Oleksiyenko { Day10/83:24} - {Day10/84:20 } \n472  NashiGroshi article titled ‘The scheme of withdrawal of funds from Privatbank by the Kolomoisky-\nBoholyubov-Dubilet group’  dated 23 December 2016 { E17/60.1 } \n473  Oleksiyenko { Day10/113:15} - {Day10/115:1 } \nAA3/3/141\n139 \n A. Before that, NBU didn't have a full picture who are related parties to the \nBank and if they are abusing or not abusing. \nQ. Right.  Okay.  That will do for me.  So in December 2016 there is a full picture, \nas far as you were concerned, that the borro wers and the suppliers -- in relation to \nthe matters which are the subject matter of the particulars of claim, the borrowers and the suppliers are simply related parties who are being used to transit funds on \nbehalf of or to siphon funds to the shareholders; correct? \nA. Yes. \nQ. In other words, in the terminolog y that the Bank likes to use in these \nproceedings, in December 2016 you are fully aware of the fact that at least $1.82 \nbillion has been misappropriated, as you see it, or that misappropriation has been \nprocured by Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov by use of the borrower and \nsupplier companies; correct? \nA. I agree with this.  \n \n Ms Pakhachuk was cross-examined on Day 12 and had this to say:474 \nQ. Now, the point that at this stage I' m interested in is -- your understanding from \nan early stage in 2017, when you look at the documents, is that the NBU had found \nthat the Bank had been used -- these were their words -- as an instrument to raise \ncapital for providing a wide circle of  Bank-related or Kolomoisky and \nBogolyubov-related parties with credit.  That's what you understood, didn't you? \nA. Yes, correct. \n \n And:475  \nQ.

Yes, as far as I can recall, my Lord.  It was in 2017, in January, to be more \nspecific. \nF8(3)  The Bank’s delay (January to July 2017) \n The Bank’s disclosure reveal s that it conducted some sp ecific investigations which \nconcerned the Supply Agreement Fraud Allega tions in the first part of 2017. The \nBank has failed to disclose the documents relating to these investigations but it \nseems obvious that the Bank was preparing for the possibility of issuing claims \nagainst D1.  \nF8(3)(a)  Mr Levadskiy’s investiga tions into the 2014 Loans \n  On 26 January 2017, pursuant to an Order signed by Mr Shlapak (the “ Shlapak \nOrder ”),477  and subject to the supervision of Mr Bolotin, the new head of security, \nthe Bank appointed a committee to be chaired by Mr Levadskiy:478  \n“to conduct an official investigation into the facts of granting loans by the Bank to \nlegal entities and individuals after receivi ng loans from the NBU for refinancing in \n൬൪൫൮ -൬൪൫൰”.479 \n Plainly, this special investigation would ha ve involved specific consideration of the \nSupply Agreement Fraud Allegations  first reported by Glavcom. \n Mr Levadskiy may have been appointed to chair the committee because he was \nalready familiar with the Supply Agreemen t Fraud Allegations having reported to \na Legal Committee on the criminal investigation in 2015.480 \n \n477  PrivatBank Order No.16.0.0.0/4-708 signed by Shlapak { E17/135 } \n478  Mr Levadskiy is referred to as the Head of the Department of Criminal Prosecution and Legal \nProtection of HO: Shlapak Order { E17/135/1 } \n479  Notably, although the Bank’s witnesses claimed th at the preparation of a claim against D1 was kept \nsecret from Bank employees, paragraph 3 of the Shlapak Order gave the Commission the right to \ngather documents and “ if necessary, select [sic, solicit] written explanations from employees and \nofficials of the bank”, and paragraph 4 allowed Mr Levadskiy to involve employees of other \ndivisions in the official investigations: Shlapak Order { E17/135/1 }. \n480  An email sent on 26 February 2015 to Mr Stupak (Head of the Legal Department) and Mr \nNakorchevsky (Mr Stupak’s Deputy) attaching links to the Glavcom Article, the LigaBusiness \nArticle and the NashiGroshi Articles refers to Mr  Levadsky having attended the Legal Committee \nand mentioned “ the criminal case” (i.e. the GPO Investigation)  “and possible interrogations of \nBank employees ”: see email from Koryak to Stupak and Nakorchevsky on 26 February 2015 \n{E8/49/1 } \nAA3/3/143\n141 \n \n Mr Levadskiy’s commission produced a 13 page report on 10 March 2017 (the \n“Levadskiy Report ”).481 The document itself is not avai lable to D1 or to the Court \n(the Bank having chosen not to disclose it).

Ms Pakhachuk’s evidence about the \nreport was less than helpful; ultimately, she claimed that she did not remember \nwhether or not she had seen it and emphasi sed that Mr Shlapak was dealing with \nthe matter.482 \n Had there been any doubt about the matter (a nd there is not), it should be readily \ninferred from its non-disclosure that the contents of the Levadskiy Report would \nonly serve to confirm that the Bank’s new management already knew everything \nthat it needed to know a bout the Supply Agreement Fr aud Allegations to bring \nproceedings at that time. \nF8(3)(b)  The Shlapak Report \n While he was in office as the Chairman of the Bank’s Management Board, Mr \nShlapak conducted a number of investig ations. He produced a long report on 20 \nJuly 2017,483 and his resignation was approved by the Supervisory Board on the \nsame day. Towards the end of that report,484 he summarised steps that had been \ntaken to investigate the Supply Agreem ent Fraud Allegations which were the \nsubject of the GPO Investigation commenced in November 2014. \n“Between January and July 2017, the Ba nk has taken the following measures  \nIssue of loans to legal entities and individu als by the Bank after receiving refinancing \nloans from the NBU in ൬൪൫൮ -൬൪൫൰ ;  \nThe materials of investigation were handed over to be included to the files of \ncriminal proceeding No. ൮൬൪൫൮൪൪൪൪൪൪൪൪൫൬൰൫ , which is investigated by the Supreme \nCourt of Ukraine on the grounds of the crime provided for in Part ൯ of Article ൫൳൫ of \nthe Criminal Code of Ukraine.  \n \n481  Annex 1 to a search report by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine initiated on 06.07.17 \nwas an “ inventory ” of documents handed to the detective { E17/158.01 }.

If these conditions are met, it is not necessary to repay loans \nat once: payments will stretch over several years. And if borrowers regularly \nrepay loans, the bank will conti nue to cooperate with them.”488 \n(൰) The same article ends with a reference to the need for legal action if D ൫ and \nD൬ did not provide collateral.489 \n“And with regard to Privatbank, the head  of the NBU, Valeria Gontareva, is \ndetermined: a refusal to restructure loan s, in accordance with the relevant law, \ncould lead the former shareholders of Privatbank to the court.” \n Mr Oleksiyenko sought to claim that the New Borrowers initially serviced their \nloans,490 but the true position (which Mr Oleksiyenko was forced to accept491) was \nthat even in early 2017 the amount of over due interest signif icantly exceeded the \namount being paid on a monthly basis. Ms Pakhachuk accepted that the new management knew from the outset that th e New Borrowers could not be relied upon \nto repay their debts.\n492 \n \n487  The 2017 Audit Report notes that “ if new companies do not receive external support, they will all \nmove to financial class 10 (default) PD=100% and, consequently, the total amount of [credit risk] \nfor the transformed portfolio will increase to UAH 126.9 bln ”; and calculates credit risk for the New \nLoans “ on the basis of assumptions that loans are not being serviced in the future, based on \nborrowers’ lack of cash flows ” {E17/138/24 }. This was used to calculate the additional capital \ninjections required: { E17/138/25 }. \n488  V oxUkraine Article {E17/134.1/1}  \n489  V oxUkraine Article {E17/134.1/8}  \n490  Oleksiyenko {Day11/45:11-19 } \n491  Oleksiyenko { Day11/46:1 } - {Day11/47:9 } \n492  Pakhachuk { Day12/71:2-12 }, {Day12/80:15-21 } \nAA3/3/146\n144 \n \n Mr Stratonov presented an  update to the Supervisor y Board on 6 March 2017 (the \n“Stratonov Report ”)493 which reported on outstanding debt as of 1 March 2017494 \nand referred to the Bank having sent letters to all rela ted party debtors495 requesting \nimmediate payment of overdue interest payments for January 2017496 and the \nprovision of additional collateral meeting the requirements of NBU Regulation 351 \nand seeking further information about the companies.

Mr Matuzka had formerly been  employed by the Ministry of Finance. \n Due to the non-disclosure of relevant documents by the Bank, little is known about \nthe work he did between January and Ju ly 2017, but on 27 July 2017, Mr Matuzka \nreported to a meeting of the Bank’s Manage ment Board.

Unsurprisingly, given how incredible \nany such suggestion would be, there is no attempt made to suggest that the \npreparation of the claim was delayed as a result.511  \n Ms Pakhachuk also complains that some em ployees of the Bank remained loyal to \nD1 and so Hogan Lovells’ instruction and investigation of the facts was kept a \n \n509  Hryn { Day11/15:18-23 }, {Day11/18:25 } - {Day11/19:10 } \n510  Hryn { Day11/17:7-12 } \n511  Pakhachuk/21-22 { B1/1/7 } \nAA3/3/150\n148 \n secret, but there is no explanation as to how that is said to have delayed the issue of \nthe proceedings.512 As set out above, the Bank had been fully briefed by the NBU \nand had already conducted its own investig ations by July 2017. The Bank did not \nneed to speak to particular witnesses before issuing proceedings. \n As Mr Oleksiyenko frankly admitted,513 proceedings could have been issued \nagainst D1 at any time after January 2017. \n Although it has not been evidenced, the true  (or at any rate the most charitable) \nexplanation for the delay appears to have  been the Bank’s desire to gather the \nevidence necessary to support an app lication for a Worldwide Freezing Order \nagainst D1 shortly before issuing proceed ings. A WFO application is of course a \nsubstantial exercise and is quite separate  from, and much more onerous than, the \ntasks of formulating a claim, drafting a claim form and issuing proceedings. \n The Claim Form was not issued until 21 December 2017, after the Bank had applied \nex parte  for a WFO on 19 December 2017.514  \nF8(6)  Conclusion on Article 267(5) \n The Bank has wholly failed to discharge its burden of proving that there were \nobjective reasons beyond its control that prev ented or significantly  hindered it from \nbringing an action in due time. \n Indeed, contrary to the Bank’s subm issions, Mr Oleksiyenko conceded, in \nunambiguous terms, that the Bank’s new ma nagement could have prepared a claim \nform and issued proceedings against D1 from early in 2017.515  \n(1) On Day 10 he said as follows:516 \nQ. ...But what we've established at the moment, Mr Oleksiyenko -- I know \nthis isn't a case that you like and cons istent with your statement -- we have \nestablished that you knew from the outset that 1.82 billion had been \n \n512  Pakhachuk/16-19, 55-57 { B1/1/6 } \n513  Oleksiyenko { Day11/112:25 } - {Day11/113:23 }, {Day11/115:13-24 } \n514  WFO application notice { G1/1 } \n515  Oleksiyenko { Day 10/39:4-20 } \n516  Oleksiyenko {Day 10/39:4-20)  \nAA3/3/151\n149 \n misappropriated or the misappropriation had been procured in exactly the \nmanner that you describe in the particulars of claim, namely by lending to \nthe borrowers and use of the sham supply contracts.

So the true position is that -- if we break it down, let's say \nin July -- I'm not worried at the moment about the period before July -- actually, let's look at the position at any time.  If the decision had been made \nto sue in Ukraine, subject to the point  about giving the former owners until \n1 July in order to see if they made good on their promise -- but subject to that, you could have made your claim in Ukraine at any time, couldn't you? \nA. Subject to statute of limitation, yes. \nQ. Yes, you had to do it in time, but there was nothing -- other than -- what \nis important for us all to be clear a bout, other than that you have taken the \ndecision that, \"We are going to give the former owners until 1 July to see if \nthey honour the gentlemen's agreement in the nationalisation letter\" -- other \n \n517  He can only have meant “ would be remedied ” as he was referring to D1 and D2’s promise in the \nNationalisation Letter referred to in Section F8(3)(c)  above \n518  Oleksiyenko  {Day10/141:3-11}  \n519  Oleksiyenko {Day11/112:14} - {Day11/113:23}  \nAA3/3/152\n150 \n than that, if you had chosen to sue in Ukraine, at any time you could have \nprepared the claim forms and issued them? \nA. Yes, that's a possibility. \nQ. Yes. Thank you. Equally, if you had wanted to do so, subject to this point \nabout your deciding to give the former owners until 1 July, you could, if you'd wanted to, have instructed Hogan Lovells at any time? \nA. Yes. \n Mr Oleksiyenko’s evidence also clearly revealed the Bank’s case that it was \nprevented from bringing proceedings expeditiously after nationalisation because of interference by D1 and D2 to be false. \n(1) Mr Oleksiyenko’s evidence was that D1  and D2 had complied with their \ncommitments in the Nationalisation Le tter to grant full and unconditional \naccess to the Bank’s premises and systems and to refrain from exercising pressure on the new management:  \nI would say that the commitment number one was almost successfully \ncompleted and there were no aggressive or undue or hostile prevention \nfrom the former UBOs or the management in taking operational control \nover the Bank.520  \n(2) Moreover, he acknowledged that the former owners took “ positive actions ” \nto hand over control, including e.g. by providing passwords: “ they provided \npasswords, they provided keys, they provide access cards, whatever, \nwhatever, necessary to fulfil this  [commitment] ”.521 \n The true reason why the Bank did not bring its claim at some point between January \nand November 2017 is, as the Bank now essentially admits, that it chose first to negotiate with D1 and then to prepare a WFO application before issuing its claim.

Both of those were choices freely made  by the Bank for commercial or tactical \nreasons and cannot possibly qualify as “ objective reasons beyond its control ”.  \n Nor is it relevant that the Bank could not  bring proceedings before the change of \nmanagement at the end of 2016. Mr Beketov confirmed that the mere fact that the \n \n520  Oleksiyenko { Day11/61:13-17 } \n521  Oleksiyenko { Day11/62:5-7 } \nAA3/3/153\n151 \n claimant is deprived of part (or even mo st) of the limitation period in which to bring \nits claim is not in itself a ground for appl ying Article 267(5). While in some cases \nthe loss of part of the limitation period would no doubt prevent the claimant from \nfiling its claim in time, that is not what happened in this case, where the Bank was in a position to file its claim for many months but chose not to do so because it \nwanted to bring the claim outside Ukrain e and make an onerous application for \nfreezing relief before doing so. That is not at  all the type of s ituation that Article \n267(5) of the Ukrainian Ci vil Code contemplates. \n The Bank’s attempt to overcome the Limitation Defence by reference to Article \n267(5) must therefore fail.  \nF9. ABUSE OF RIGHTS  \n In the alternative to its a pplication under Article 267(5) , the Bank contended in its \nOpening Submissions that the Limitation Defence should be rejected on the ground that it amounted to an abuse of rights.\n522 \n This was a hopeless submission, for two reasons in terms of Ukrainian law.  \n(1) There is not a single Ukrainian case in which abuse of rights has been applied \n(or apparently even invoked) as a free-standing ground to disapply a \nlimitation period where the claimant c ould not satisfy the requirements of \nArticle 267(5).  \n(2) Indeed, there appears to be  only one case where abuse of rights has even been \nmentioned in this context. In Sirius-Bud ,523 the Supreme Court disapplied a \nlimitation period under Article 267(5), but as  part of its discussion of that \nissue indicated that an abus e of rights by eith er party could be relevant to the \nexercise of the discretion to disapply.524 It is not clear from the judgment \nprecisely why the Court consid ered abuse of rights to be relevant or what, if \n \n522  Bank.Opening/514 { AA2/1/203 } \n523  Sirius-Bud {C7/78} \n524  Sirius-Bud  at [94.5]-[94.6] { C7/78/40 } \nAA3/3/154\n152 \n anything, it added to the analysis unde r Article 267(5), but the significant \npoint is that the decision to disa pply the limitation period was made under \nArticle 267(5), and abuse of rights wa s referred to only in that context:525 \nthere is no suggestion that abuse of rights might be an independent basis for \nrejecting a limitation defence if Artic le 267(5) was not engaged. Mr Beketov \naccepted this in cross-examination:526  \nQ. And once one reads this properly and sees what the Supreme Court is \nsaying, if we could go back a page, it is abundantly clear that there is no independent basis of abuse of rights, as you are suggesting. This is all under 267(5) and factors that the court considers when exercising its discretion. That’s right, isn’t it? \nA. In this particular case, it is so, but I took this provision of the Supreme \nCourt judgment as instructing in a sense that, you know, we don’t have system of stare decisis. \nQ. I’m not asking how you got there, Mr Beketov. Now that I’m pointing out \nto you -- let me start again.

When I have been questioning you, you have been \nkeen to say that there was a Supreme Court case which supported your thesis \nthat abuse of rights was an independe nt ground for disallowing limitation. So \nfar, what I’ve just said is correct, isn’t it? \nA. In this particular case, yes. \nQ. Yes. Well, this is the case that yo u relied on, and when properly read, the \ndicta, the words of the Supreme Court th at you were relying on in 94.5, are \nsimply part of the court’s analysis of Article 267(5); we’ve agreed that? \nA. If you take structure of this argument which was made by Supreme \nCourt, yes, you’re right. \n(3) Although Mr Beketov sought to maintain that abuse of righ ts could be an \nindependent ground for overriding a limita tion defence, he was unable to \nidentify any circumstances in which it might be appropriate to disapply a limitation period in favour of a claimant who ex hypothesi had no valid reason \nfor bringing its claim out of time.\n527 \n(4) Mr Beketov’s argument that abuse of rights could apply in this way was \nconsistent with his overly expansive approach to abus e of rights in general, \n \n525  The sub-paragraphs which refer to abuse of rights, [94.5]-[92.6], must be read in the context of [94] \nas a whole {C7/78/39} , which addresses Article 267(5).  \n526  Beketov { Day27/95:18 } - {Day27/96:17 } \n527  Beketov { Day27/98:6-23 } \nAA3/3/155\n153 \n including his view that an  abuse of rights could, without more, satisfy the \nrequirement of unlawfulness for the purpos es of a tortious claim for damages. \nYet he accepted that there had never b een a decision of any Ukrainian court \nto that effect, and indeed was unawa re of any litigant ever even having \nadvanced such an argument.528 Moreover, his opinion was directly contrary \nto the view of the Constitutional Cour t which clearly held in 2021 that the \nrules on abuse of rights “ do not qualify a person's actions as an offence under \ncivil law or as another condition for holding a person liable under civil \nlaw.”529 Whether or not Mr Beketov was expressing his genuine views on \nthese points or deliberate ly going out of his way to assist the Bank, his \nevidence as to the scope of the abuse of  rights doctrine cannot safely be taken \nto represent current Ukrainian law. \n The Bank in its Closing Submissions unsur prisingly no longer maintains that abuse \nof rights is an independent ground for disa pplying the limitation period, and instead \nseeks to repackage the allega tion of abuse of rights as a matter which should lead \nto the limitation period being disapplied under Article 267(5).530 \n However, that too is unsustainable because the suggestion that the Bank was \nhindered from bringing its claim by the actions of D1 is contrary to the facts. As set \nout above in the context of Article 267(5) , it is simply not the case that anything \ndone by D1 prevented or significantly hi ndered the Bank from investigating the \nclaim and placing itself in a position to commence proceedings within the limitation \nperiod. The Bank was well able to commen ce proceedings long before the limitation \nperiod expired but chose not to do so for its own reasons which have nothing to do \nwith any actions of D1. \n Here and elsewhere, the Bank’s recourse to the abuse of right s doctrine amounts to \nlittle more than saying that, simply because  the claim is based on an alleged fraud, \nthe abuse of rights principle somehow exempt s it from any legal rules that stand in \nthe way of the claim succeeding.

T\nHE ADDITIONAL CLAIMS ADVANCED BY AMENDMENT IN JULY 2020  ARE TIME -\nBARRED  \n In Closing, the Bank repeats what was said in Opening531 which itself refers to its \nSkeleton Argument of 4 September 2020 (“ Skeleton Argument ”).532  \n A Protective Claim Form issued by the Bank on 14 July 2020533 alleged that: \n“sums drawn down pursuant to the loans identified in Schedule ൫ hereto … caused \n(in part) two payments to the Fifth Defendant [Collyer] pursuant to sham supply agreements between the Fifth Defendant  and Alfatrader LLC and Foxar LLC, as \nidentified in Schedule ൬ hereto.”   \n  Schedule 1534 to the Protective Claim Form identified the borrowers under these \nloan facilities as Prominmet, Celastrina, Densitron and Fiastra (the “ Additional \nBorrowers ”).  \n The Claim Form did not attempt to part icularise how the drawdowns had funded \nURPP but valued the claim at approximately USD 46 million. Particulars were later provided by reference to Mr Thompson’s subsequent work. \n The Additional Claims in fact contribute USD 56 million to the Bank’s claim of \nUSD 1.9 billion (i.e. around 3% of it). Schedule 2535 identified that:  \n \n531  Bank.Closing/653 {AA2/15/339} , referring to Bank.Opening/516-517 {AA2/1/204}  \n532  Skeleton Argument of 04.09.20 {G2/63}  \n533  Protective Claim Form dated 14 July 2020 { I3/64 } \n534  Schedule 1 to the Protective Claim Form dated 14 July 2020 { I3/65 } \n535  Schedule 2 to the Protective Claim Form dated 14 July 2020 { I3/66 } \nAA3/3/157\n155 \n (1) drawdowns by Prominmet, Celastrina a nd Densitron together contributed to \nan Unreturned Prepayment made by Alfatrader to Collyer in the amount of \nUSD 38,770,600 made on 3 June 2014; and that  \n(2) a drawdown by Fiastra had c ontributed to an Unretu rned Prepayment made \nby Foxar to Collyer in the amount  of USD 17,252,433 on 19 August 2014. \n The Bank sought to amend the Particulars of Claim in these proceedings so as to \nintroduce these new matters (“ New Matters ”) and expand its claims against D1 \nand D2 to include new alleged misappropriations. \n In paragraph 18 of its Skeleton Argument,536 the first point made by the Bank was \nthat it brought “ a single cause of acti on in tort against D1-D8 ”. That is not \nmaintained. The Bank at trial has emphasised that there were 270 Relevant Drawdowns each involving a separate misappropriation.\n537 Nor is it true to say in \nparagraph 19 and 20 that the Bank is merely  producing further particularisation of \na claim to USD 1,911,887,385. That figure represented the tota l amount of the \nURPP but the Bank had only claimed misa ppropriations of money under Relevant \nLoans made to the Original 46 Ukrainian Borrowers who had paid those URPP.

The Bank maintains that \neven when Relevant Drawdowns involved the advance of UAH, the Bank felt its \nloss in USD. The value of the UAH at the time of drawdown was such that the total \nequivalent amount of the Re levant Drawdown Portions if measured in USD was \nUSD 1,911,877,365. \n However, for the reasons explained in Section B2  of the Quantum Annex ,546 the \nBank did not feel all of its loss in USD. It fe lt its loss in the curr ency of the Relevant \nDrawdown. \n The Repayment Defence should succeed as a matter of Ukrainian law and, as a \nresult, (i) repayments funded by further le nding are not to be i gnored; and (ii) the \nfull Credit Value is to be ascribed to Transferred Assets.  \n As a result of the above, pr ior to consideration of the Limitation Defence, the only \namounts outstanding are USD 8.1m owed  by Tamersa and UAH 147.4m owed by \nProminmet.547 \n While Tamersa was not a party to the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings and was not the \nsubject of the Glavcom Article , the fact that it had made Prepayments to Trade Point \nAgro (D4) between 19 - 23 June 2014548 which had not been returned within 3 \nmonths was readily ascertainable from the Bank’s records in October and November 2014 and the Bank’s claims in resp ect of funds advan ced to Tamersa are \nbarred by D1’s general Limitation Defence. \n The loans advanced to Prominmet were th e subject of the A dditional Claims not \nbrought until July 2020 and are time barred in any event. \n \n546  Section B2  of the Quantum Annex {AA3/4/12}  \n547  See D1.Opening/461 { AA3/1/137}   \n548  See Thompson1, Appendix 3-2-34-1 {D1/74/1}  \nAA3/3/161\n159 \n \n Accordingly, even if the Court were to conclude that D1 was responsible for \nunlawful conduct and might otherwise have been liable for loss caused by the \nalleged misappropriation, the claims against D1 should be dismissed. \n ൬൰ October ൬൪൬൭  \nMARK HOWARD KC \nMICHAEL BOOLS KC \nALEC HAYDON KC \nALEXANDER MILNER KC \nGEOFFREY KUEHNE \nJAGODA KLIMOWICZ \nBrick Court Chambers \n \nAA3/3/162\n"}
