{"start": 17500, "text": " ................................ ................................ ................................ .............................  490 \n \n  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n7 \n  \nMr Justice Trower  \n \nIntroductio n to the claims  \n1. At the time of the events with which these proceedings are  concerned, t he claimant, \nJSC Commercial Bank Privatbank  (the “Bank”),  was Ukraine’s largest bank.   It was \ndeclared insolvent by the National Bank of Ukraine (“NBU”) on 18 December 2016 \nand was nationalised over the course of the following days .  These proceedings have \nbeen  brought by the Bank against two of its founding shareholders , the first defendant, \nIgor Kolomoisky  and the second defendant Gennadiy Bogolyubov  (together the \n“Individual Defendant s”), and six companies said to be owned or controlled by them \n(the third to eighth defendants (the “Corporate Defendants”) ) seeking  compensation for \nharm caused by what the Bank alleges to have been their participation in a fraudulent \nscheme carried out prior to nationalisation . \n2. The Bank also seeks relief against  the Corporate Defendants  in unjust enrichment .  The \nthird to fifth defendants , Teamtrend Limited (“Teamtrend”), Trade Point Agro Limited \n(“Trade Point  Agro ”) and Collyer Limited (“Collyer”)  (together the “English \nDefendants”) are English companies, while the sixth to eight h defendants , Rossyn \nInvesting Corp (“Rossyn”), Milbert Ventures Inc (“Milbert”) and Z AO \nUkrtransitservice Ltd (“ Ukrtransitservice ”) (together the “BVI Defendants”) are \nincorporated in the British Virgin  Islands.  \n3. It is common ground  that, between 2010 and nationalisation, the Individual Defendants  \nowned a controlling stake in the Bank , although each of them held less than 50% of the \nshares and the nature an d extent of th e control  they in fact exercised was an issue at the \ntrial.  In particular, one of the issues which I shall have to decide is the extent to which \n(and the period for which) Mr Bogolyubov exercised an influence over the Bank’s \naffairs which was commensurate with the extent of his shareholding.  It is his case that , \nby the time of the relevant events, he was taking a back seat role in the Ba nk’s affairs \nand was exercising his shareholder rights on the instructions of Mr Kolomoisky.  \n4. Until  nationalisation, the Individual Defendants  were also members of the Bank’s \nsupervisory board (the “Supervisory Board”) .  Prior to 30 April 2015, there was one \nother member of the Supervisory Board and Mr Bogolyubov was its chairman , a \nposition which he had held since shortly after the Bank’s transformation into a PJSC on \n6 July 2000 .  After 30 April 2015, there were three other members of the Supervisory \nBoard, one of whom was its chairman.  \n5. The claim made by the Bank is that  more than US$1.9 billion w as extracted from  its \nassets  at the behest of  and for the ultimate benefit of the Individual Defendants , using \na complex network of vehicles  owned and/or controlled by them  through a large number \nof nominees , many of whom were employees  either  of Pr ydniprovsky i Business Centre  \nLLC , formerly Privat Business Centre  LLC  (“PBC”)  or Primecap Cyprus Limited \n(“Primecap”), both entities which featured prominently in the proceedings .  These \nvehicles includ ed the Corporate Defendants .  The extraction was said to have been done  \nin the course  of what was described in some of t he Bank ’s internal records  as a currency \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n8 \n contracts project .

It is the Bank’s case that a number of senior employees, including in \nparticular certain  members of its management board (the “Management Board”) \nparticipated in this project at the direction  of the Individual Defendants .  It is also the \nBank’s case that , notwithstanding the fact that compliance with those instructions w as \nobviously contrary  to Ukrainian law and the Bank’s interests , they did so  because they \nwanted to keep their jobs.  \n6. Throughout its submissions, the Bank referred to the totality of what occurred as the \n“Misappropriation”.  This language is used because it is  alleged that th e Bank was \nprocured by the Individual Defendants  to advance  loans (the “Relevant Loans”) to 50 \nborrowers (the “Borrowers”) with no business activity  and no genuine credit or trading \nhistor y.  47 of the Borrowers were  incorporated in Ukraine (the “Ukrainian Borrowers”) \nand three  were incorporated in Cyprus : Celastrina Trading Co Ltd  (“Celastrina”) , \nFiastra Trading Ltd (“Fiastra”) and Densitron Enterprises Ltd (“Densitron”) (together \n“the Cypriot Borrowers”) .  When these proceedings were commenced , the Bank ’s case \nwas based on Relevant Loans to 46 of the Ukrainian Borrowers.   The Relevant L oans \nto the Cypriot  Borrowers and  one of the Ukrainian Borrowers, Prominmet LLC \n(“Prominmet”) , were only added to these proceedings by amendment with effect from \nthe issue of a protective claim form on 14 July 2020, by which time it is said by the \nDefendants that the limitation period had expired.   I shall return to whether that is the \ncase at the end of this judgment.  \n7. The Bank’s case  is that each of the Borrowers  was owned and/or controlled by one or \nboth of the Individual Defendants .  Sums were drawn down under the Relevant  Loans \nin both Ukrainian hryvnia (“UAH”) and US dollars (“US$”); in the case of UAH \ndrawdowns they were then  converted into U S$.  Amounts were then transferred , either \ndirectly or indirectly after one or more intermediate recycling transactions, to the \nCorporate Defenda nts’ accounts at the Bank’s Cyprus branch  as prepayments under 54 \nsham supply agreement s (the “Relevant Supply Agreements” or “RSAs”) .  It is the \nBank’s case that the RSAs  were  executed simply to provide the Borrowers with a  \npretext for moving foreign currency out of U kraine.  \n8. I shall explain what happened in more detail later in this judgment but , until September  \n2014 , prepayments to  suppliers under  the scheme of which the Misappropriation is said \nto have formed part were recycled by being repaid to the relevant borrower , which then \nused that amount to fund another prepayment under another supply agreement.  It is the \nBank’s case that the drawdowns  stopped in September  2014  when what it called the \nactive stage of the Misappropriation came to an end . \n9. When and after that had occurred, the net position was that  82 prepayments , which had \nbeen made to the Corporate Defendants  under the RSAs , and which were said by the \nBank to have  been funded by 270 drawdowns  totalling  US$2,335 ,943,519 (“Relevant \nDrawdowns”) made under the Relevant Loans, were not returned to the Borrowers .  In \nthese proceedings , these prepayments to the Corporate Defendants which were not \nreturned were referred to as  the “Unreturned Prepayments”.   The gross  value of the \nUnreturned Prepayments was US$1,997 ,835,585  but, of that amount , four of the \nBorrowers made partial repayments of US$85,958,200 .  It follows that the net figure \nfor Unre turned Prepayment s totalled  US$1,911,877,385 . \n10. As to the Relevant Drawdowns, some (totalling US$384,214,201  on the Bank’s \nmethodology)  were recorded in the Bank’s books as being used in part to repay other \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank "}

The gross  value of the \nUnreturned Prepayments was US$1,997 ,835,585  but, of that amount , four of the \nBorrowers made partial repayments of US$85,958,200 .  It follows that the net figure \nfor Unre turned Prepayment s totalled  US$1,911,877,385 . \n10. As to the Relevant Drawdowns, some (totalling US$384,214,201  on the Bank’s \nmethodology)  were recorded in the Bank’s books as being used in part to repay other \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n9 \n Relevant Drawdown s by the same or another Borrower.  To avoid double counting, t he \nBank’s claim gives credit for those instances .  The net total is therefore \nUS$1,951,729,318 , which is  approximately US$40 million more tha n the amount of the \nUnreturned Prepayments, but the Bank limits its claim to the lower figure.  \n11. The Bank’s internal records indicated that it had security for the Relevant Loans in the \nform of pledges over the Borrowers’ contractual rights under the RSAs  and over a \nfurther set of supply agreements , called the “Loan File Supply Agreements” or the \n“LFSAs” .  It is the Bank’s case that the security o ver the RSAs (the “RSA Pledges”) \nwas worthless and that they and  both the LFSAs and the security granted over the \nLFSAs (the “ LFSA Pledges ”) were shams ex ecuted to make it appear from the Bank’s \nfiles that its lending was adequately secured.  \n12. It is the Individual Defendants’  case that , apart from the pledges over the RSAs and the \nLFSAs , repayment of the amounts outstanding under the Relevant Loans  was fully \nsecured by  50 pledges granted by 40 pledgors (the “Share Pledgors”) over shares in 25 \ncompanies other than the Borrowers  (the “Share Pledges”) .  The Individual Defendants \nadmitted that 22 of the Share Pledgors and 20 of the companies whose shares had been \npledged (together the “Share Pledge companies”) were owned and/or controlled by one \nor both of them , although they said that they did not know that their assets had been \nused in this w ay.  The Share Pledges were released shortly before nationalisation but , \neven if they had not been , the Bank contends that they would have been woefully \ninadequate security for the Relevant Loans.  \n13. Between September and November 2014, 4 6 of the 50 Borrowers commenced 51 \nclaims in the Economic Court of Dnepropetrovsk and three  sets of arbitration \nproceedings against a Corporate Defendant claimi ng repayment of the funds which it \nhad prepaid to that Corporate Defendant under an RS A (the “2014 Ukrainian \nProceedings”) .  In those of the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings which were before the \ncourt , judgment against the relevant Corporate Defendant  to repay the prepay ment  it \nhad received was given on various dates between 7 October 2014 and 24 Decem ber \n2014 .  In those of the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings which were pursued by way of  \narbitration, awards  requiring Trade Point  Agro  and Collyer to repay the funds they were \nprepaid by three of the Borrowers were made in February and April 2015.  \n14. None of the judgments given or awards made in the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings was \nenforced .  The Bank  contends that the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings were an artificial \nconstruct procured and pursued in collusion between, amongst othe rs, the Borrowers \nand the Corporate Defendants .  They were not designed to secure genuine recovery for \nthe Borrowers or the Bank but were intended to avoid currency control penalties and \nfurnish the Bank with evidence (capable of being supplied to the NBU  as its regulator ) \nto explain why the Relevant Loans had not been repaid.  \n15. The Bank claims  to have lost more than US$1.9 billion  as a result  of the \nMisappropriation , although it accepts that it must give credit for the true value of certain \nassets (the “Transferred Assets”) it received from or on behalf of the Individual \nDefendants as part of w hat was called the “Asset Transfer s”.

This figure is the same as \nthe amount of the Unre turned Prepayments.   One of the principal issues is whether , \nnotwithstanding the Unreturned Prepayments, the amounts advanced under the 270 \nRelevant Draw downs were in fact repaid, and , if so, whether the Bank can establish \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n10 \n that it nonetheless suffered compensable harm from the Misappropriation  in the sums \nclaimed . \n16. All parties agree that the issue of whether  the Defendants  are liable  to compensate the \nBank  for the loss it claims to have sustained  by reason of the Misappropriation is \ngoverned by Ukrainian law .  The Bank’s claim against the Individual Defendants is \nmade in tort pursuant to Article 1166 (1) of the Ukrainian Civil Code  (“Article 1166 ” \nand the “Civil Code” respectively ), which  applies  where harm to a person’s  property \nhas been caused by an unlawful decision, act or omission .  That person then becomes \nentitle d to full compens ation  from the person who caused the harm .  Article 1166 \nprovides as follows:  \n“Property harm caused by unlawful decisions, actions or omissions to the personal \nnon-property rights of a natural or legal person, as well as harm caused to the \nproperty of a natural or legal person, shall be compensated in full by the person \nwho caused th e harm. ” \n17. The Bank submitted  that it is self -evident that the orchestration of the Misappropriation \nby the Individual Defendants , and/or their participation in it , amounted to unlawful \nconduct by them of a character contemplated  by Art icle 1166. \n18. The Bank also has claim s in tort and unjust enrichment against  the Corporate  \nDefendants.   The claim in tort is based on the same Ukrainian law principles as are \napplicable to the claim  against the Individual Defendants  and arises out of their \nparticipation in the acts causing harm to the Bank .  The re is a dispute as to whether its \nclaim in  unjust enrichment is governed by Ukraini an law (for which the Bank contends)  \nor the law of Cyprus (for which the Corporate D efendants contend) . \n19. The Bank contends that the Corporate Defendants’  liability in unjust enrichment under \nUkrainian law arises under  Article s 1212(1) and 1213 of the Civil Code  (“Article 1212” \nand “Article 1213” respectively) , which provide that a  person who has acquired or \npreserved property at the expense of another person without sufficient legal grounds is \noblig ed to return that property to the injured party , either in kind  or, where that is \nimpossible , through compensa tion for its value .  It also contends that if its claims in \nunjust enrichment  are governed by Cypriot law  the applicable provisions are  section s \n65 and  70 of the Cypriot Contract Law , Cap. 149 (the “Contract La w”), alternatively at \ncommon law.  \n20. Neither of the Individual Def endants  has advance d any explanation as to how  the \nRelevant Drawdowns can be said to have been  made for legitimate commercial \npurposes  and neither  of them has made a positive case that the RSAs were genuine \nsupply agreements .  However , they do not accept that the making of the Relevant Loans \nto the Borrowers or the transfer of money from the Borrowers to the Corporate \nDefendants involved any misappropriation of the Bank’s funds  and they deny that the \nBank has proved that they received any benefit from the monies said by the Bank to \nhave been misapplied . \n21.

Mr Kolomoisky  also denie d that he caused  the RSAs to be entered into  and denies that \nhe was aware of them or indeed the making of the Relevant Loans at the time they were \nmade .  It is part of his defence that he took no part in the lending decisions , all of which , \nwere made by the chairman of the Management  Board (Oleksandr ( Alexander ) Dubilet) \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n11 \n acting on the instruction s of the Bank’s credit committee (the “ECC”) .  This included \nthe Relevant Loans, which (like the Relevant Drawdowns  and the RSAs ) he did not \nprocure and of which he was unaware.   In other words , he says that the Bank has not \nestablished that he was sufficiently involved in what occurred to render him liable for \nany losses it sustained as a result of the Misappropriation.   \n22. Mr B ogolyubov’s position was expressed in similar terms .  He denied that he had any \nexecutive role within the Bank and said that he was not responsible for  and did not \nmanage or exercise day -to-day control over its activities including its lending decisions .  \nLike Mr Kolomoisky , he also pleaded in his Defence that he did not control any of the \nBorrowers and that, if they did enter into the various agreements alleged by the Bank, \nit was not with his knowledge or on his instructions .  In particular, Mr Bogoly ubov \nasserts that the court must be careful to ensure that it does not approach the evidence \non the assumption that participation in what occurred by one of them (viz. Mr \nKolomoisky) necessarily involved participation by the other (viz. Mr Bogolyubov).  \n23. One of the more significant (and curious)  aspects of Mr Bog olyubov’s case is his plea  \nthat in or about the beginning of July 2014 , he made an oral agreement with Mr \nKolomoisky to exercise  the voting rights attached to his shares in the Bank and his \nduties as chairman of the Supervisory Board at the sole direction of Mr Kolomoisky.   \nHe said that l ater, in May and June 2015 , this was reflected in  formal documentation \n(the “D eeds of Waiver  and Indemnity ”).  The Bank does not accept that what was said \nin the Deeds of Waiver and Indemnity reflect ed the truth of what was happe ning.  \n24. The very nature of what occurred meant that , unlike the Individual Defendants,  the \nCorporate Defendants did not seek to say that they did not participate in what occurred.  \nHowever, they deny that they were owned or controlled by the Individual Defendants  \nor that they were party  to the Misappropriation .  They also deny that anything they may \nhave done caused the Bank any harm  and they therefore deny any liability to the Bank .  \nIn that context they made common cause with the Individual Defendants on the claims \nagainst them under Article 1166 . \n25. The Corporate Defendants  advanced two main defences to the claims in unjust \nenrichment based on receipt of the Unreturned Prepayments.  The first is that, whether \nUkrainian or Cypriot law applies, there is no cause of action in unjust enrichment where \nthe receipts were indirect, as they were said to be in the present case, because they \npassed through the hands of the Borrowers.  The second is that the English Defendants \nreceived the Unreturned Prepayments (and indeed entered into the RSAs) as agents for \nundisclosed principals and, not being on notice of the Bank’s claims before making \nonward transfers, are not liable for that reason.

The second is that the English Defendants \nreceived the Unreturned Prepayments (and indeed entered into the RSAs) as agents for \nundisclosed principals and, not being on notice of the Bank’s claims before making \nonward transfers, are not liable for that reason.  The Bank disputed this and, amongst \nother matters, contended that the relevant agency agreements (described later in this \njudgment and defined as the “English Agency Agreements”) were shams and the \ncounterparties to them were companies associated with the Individual Defendants.  \n26. There was therefore  a slight difference in emph asis between the pleaded position of the \nEnglish Defendants and the pleaded position of the BVI Defendants:  \ni) The Corporate  Defendants said that, althou gh the English Defendants  did not \nseek to verify the substance of the transactions , they had no knowledge of their \ncommercial  purpose.  They said that  the English Defendants  executed the RSA s \nand received prepayments under them as agents for undisclosed  principals  (the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n12 \n “ED Principals”) .  They did so  in the good faith belief that they were genuine \ntransactions and/or with the intention  of performing them .  They also said that \nany sums t he English Defendants received under them were paid on \nimmediately to the  ED P rincipals o r to third parties identified by the ED \nPrincipals.  \nii) The Corporate  Defendants contend ed that the RSAs into which the  BVI \nDefendants  entered were genuine, arm’s length agreements , and t hey made \nonward payments of the sums received before having any notice of the Bank’s \nclaim.   They accept ed that the  BVI Defendants did not supply any goods under \nthose RSAs and therefore became (and remain ) obliged to pay the counter -party \nBorrowers the amounts of the prepayments  they received.  \n27. One of the more striking aspects of the way that the Individual Defendants chose to \ndefend the  case against them  is that , although they both made and served witness \nstatement s for use at the trial , neither of them was called  to give evidence .  The Bank \nwas therefore unable to test their pleaded cases with  either of them in cross -\nexamination .  It was also unable to explore with them their role in what appeared  on the \nface of it  to have been unlawful conduct  within and t o the det riment of a major bank in \nwhich each of them had a very substantial ownership interest .  Similarly , although Mr \nKolomoisky served witness statements  from a further four witness es, none of th em was \ncalled  to give  evidence  and their witnesses statem ents were withdraw n.  Neither Mr \nBogolyubov nor the Corporate Defendants served any statements from third part y \nwitnesses of fact  in support of their defences.   \n28. The decisions by the Individual Defendants  not to give evidence , and not to call  the \nwitness es whose  statements had been served in support of their case on the facts , were \nmade  late in the process of preparing the case for trial and well after the date on which \nit was originally  fixed to commence.   While it was not suggested that circumstances \nbeyond their control constrained them  from giving oral evidence, b oth contend ed that \nthe court should not draw adverse inferences from  this course of events.  It was said \nthat t here was no need for them to give evidence,  because  the way in which the cases \nagainst all of the Defendants in tort had been formulated were  misconceived , and  that \nthe Bank could not prove its case on their participation in what occurred . \n29.

It had always been possible that either or both of the Individual Defendants  would \ndecide not to give  evidence (see e.g. , the judgment I delivered on their application for \nan adjournment of the trial in the light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (JSC \nCommerc ial Bank Privatbank  v. Kolomoisky and others  [2022] EWHC 775 (Ch) at \n[19])).  Nonetheless, I shall have  to give careful consideration to the nature and extent \nof any inferences I should draw from the fact that both have chosen not to  do so . \n30. As I have already indicated, t here was no real attempt by any of the Defendants to argue \nthat the scheme was operated for legitimate banking purposes , although Mr \nBogolyubov  in particular argued that there was insufficient evidence of a \nmisappropriation from which he himself  benefit ted.  What occurred  was said to be no \nmore than one part of a loan recycling  scheme driven by a desire to avoid Ukraine’s \ncurrency control regime .  In short, i t was submitted that , even if the Bank established \nthat it had suffered a loss to the extent of the Unreturned Prepayments , there was no \nevidence that the Bank’s property to the extent of  this loss was misappropriated  for their \nbenefit . \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n13 \n 31. The fact that the Misappropriation on which the Bank sue d was one, but only one part \nof a loan  recycling scheme  was at the heart of the Defendants ’ argument  that the Bank \nhas been driven to  formulate its case in a manner which is misconceived .  They all \nsubmitted that the Bank has ta ken into account only one part of a much bigger pic ture \nand ignored what occurred both earlier and later in the working through of the scheme.   \nThe Defendants  said that t he reason the Bank  took the course that it did was that it had \nalways wanted to sue them  in England , in part to obtain the benefit of freezing orders  \nand other interim relief.   It was said that t he only way in which the Bank  could justify \nproceedings in England  was to focus its claim on limited facts relating to Relevant \nDrawdowns , whic h funded  Unreturned P repayments advanced to the Corporate \nDefendants, including in particular the English Defendants .  This was said to have been \ndone for the purpose of providing a sufficient anchor to give this court jurisdiction \npursuant to Article 6(1) of the Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of \nJudgments in Civil and Commercial Matters 2007 (the “Lugano Convention ”).  If there \nhad been no English anchor defendants, the Individual Defe ndants  would have been \nentitled to be sued in Switzerland, which was (anyway at the commencement of these \nproceedings) their own place of domicile.  \n32. Arguments based on jurisdiction first featured on the Defendants’ applications to \nchallenge the making of a worldwide freezing order  (“WFO”)  originally made by  \nNugee J on 19 December 2017 and for the proceedings to be struck out on grounds \nbased on Article 6 of the Lugano Convention.  These applications were successful \nbefore Fancourt J ( PJSC Commercial Bank Privatbank  v. Kolomoisky and others  \n[2018] EWHC 1910 (Ch))  as recorded in an order made on 4 De cember 201 8, but his \ndecision was reversed by the Court of Appeal on 15 October 2019 ( JSC Commercial \nBank Privatbank  v.

Kolomoisky and others  [2019] EWCA Civ 1708 , [2020] C h 783 ).  \nThey continued to feature throughout the case and were at the heart of the Defendants’  \nclosing submissions at the trial because they submitte d that the court should have no \nsympathy for the Bank if it were to conclude that there was an insufficient nexus \nbetween the Misappropriation on which it had sued and the compensation which it \nclaimed , arising out of the operation of the loan recycling scheme.  This would simply \nbe the result of a self -imposed straitjacket, which the Bank was required to wear by \nreason of the forum shopping in which it had chosen to engage.  \n33. The Defendants then submitted that this forum  shopping has given rise to an \nirremediable difficulty for the Bank because , whatever may have been the position in \nrelation to the scheme more generally, the advances made under the Relevant \nDrawdowns were repaid by a number of means, including further advances, thereby \ndischarging not just the Borrowers’ liability under them, but also any claims in tort and \nany claims in restitution against the Corporate Defendants.   This was called the \n“Repayment Defence”,  an expression which I shall adopt in this judgment . \n34. The first of the means by which the Relevant Drawdowns were said to have been repaid \nwere one of the two categories described as repayments by cash (the “Cash \nRepayments”) , a phrase which for convenience I shall use in this judgment .  It is not \nsuggested that any actual cash was used , because  what occurred was that the proceeds \nof one or more loans were used to repay other loans by way of accounting entry in the \nBank’s books.   Cash Repaym ents falling into this first category were themselves funded \nby drawdo wns on loans (the “Intermediary Loans”) entered into by 34 further \nborrowers , which were not also Borrowers under the Relevant Loans  (the “Intermediary \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n14 \n Borrowers”) .  As with the Bo rrowers, it is the  Bank’s case that each of the Intermediary \nBorrowers was owned and/or controlled by one or both of the Individual Defendants . \n35. The Bank’s answer is that , although these repayments were recorded as such in the \nBank’s books , they should not be treated as such for the purpose s of their claim in tort \nagainst the Defendants , because the Bank received no or no significant value as a result \nof those repayment s.  They simply amounted to a further layer of sham lending to \ncompanies owned and/or controlled by the Individual Defendants  and did not constitute \na genuine source of recovery for the Bank .  In short, s uch ledger entries as were made \nwere funded by further fraudulent borrowing and therefore did not  serve to  extinguish \nor reduce the Bank’s loss.  \n36. The Defendants also submitted  that the Bank’s losses were reduced by the Asset \nTransfers , which were  used to reduce the outstanding balances on the Relevant Loans.  \nIt was invariably the case that the Tran sferred Assets were not held in the name of the \nIndividual Defendants, but it was the Bank’s case that , whatever the identity of the \nentity (the “Asset Transferor”) by which the  Transferred Assets  were held prior to the \nrelevant Asset  Tran sfer, they were in fact held  by or on behalf of  one or both of the \nIndividual Defendants.  The Bank accept ed that, if and to the extent that  there was a \ngenuine transfer of the Tran sferred Assets , credit can be given for their true value so \nlong as that value  was applied in reduction of the outstanding amount s drawn down  \nunder the Relevant Loan .  However, there is a significant dispute between the parties \nas to the true value s o"}

However, there is a significant dispute between the parties \nas to the true value s of the Transferred A ssets (which the Bank  said were significantly \nand deliberately inflated by the Individual De fendants)  and therefore as to the amounts \nfor which the Bank is required to give credit in reduction of the full compensat ion to \nwhich it is entitled under Article 1166 . \n37. The third aspect of the Repayment Defence arose out of  what the Defendants claim to \nhave been a second category of Cash Repayments  in the form of a series of new loans \ntotalling c.US$5.7 billion  (the “New Loans” ) made by the Bank  to 36 companies (the \n“New Borrowers”)  in the period 20 October  2016 to  18 November 2016 , which was \nshortly before the Bank’s nationalisation .  The New Borrowers , which were also said \nby the  Bank to have been owned and/or controlled by the Individual Defendants,  used \nthose funds to repay old loans , including sums outstanding under the Relevant Loans \nand the Intermediary Loan s, in a process referred to as the “Transformation”.   It was \nsaid that, to the extent that the Bank suffered any loss, that was caused either by the \nBank’s conduct  of the Transformation on the orders of the NBU , or by the release of \ncollateral (including the Share Pledges ) before the assets owned by the companies \nwhose shares had been pledged could be used to secure the New Loans.  It was the \nBank’s case  that the New Loans were designed to disguise earlier illegitimate lending \nand denies that the Share Pledges were adequate or valuable security for the old loans.  \n38. One of the important aspects of the Repayment Defence is the Ukrainian law  \nconsequence of whether  the Relevant Loans  were valid or void .  It is not in issue that, \nif they were valid, a valid repayment would not just discharge the debt but also \nextinguish any loss sustained by the lender to the extent of  the original advance .  The \nposition is more complex if the Relevant Loan was void (as the Banks contends to be \nthe case ).  The Defendants now seek to advance a case  that the Bank will have  suffered \nno loss in respect of the Relevant Loans if and to the extent that it chose to accept \npayments as discharging the Borrowers ’ liabilities to retu rn the sums drawn down under \nthe Relevant Loans, as opposed to other liabilities in respect of later loans , a choice \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n15 \n which it is said that the Bank self -evidently made .  Particular  reliance was placed on \nthe choices made by the Bank after nationalisation when it was  no longer owned or \ncontrolled by the Individual Defendants . \n39. The Bank said that the way in which the Defendants sought to advance their case on  \nchoice in their closing submissions was not open to them on the pleadings , was \nunheralded until the service of closing submissions  and was not adequately explored in \nthe evidence.  Whether that is a complete answer to the point is one to which I will \nrevert later in this judgment . \n40. The Defendants also advance d a defence that the Bank suffered no loss to the extent \nthat funds advanced under the Relevant Loans were transferred back to the Bank.  This \ninvolved an argument that any liabilities arising out of the making of the Relevant \nDrawdowns were discharged by using those funds to discharge separate liabilities \narising out of Relevant Loans or other loans.  This was called the “Use of Funds \nDefence” , but was said by the Bank to be unsustainable for the reasons explai"}

This was called the “Use of Funds \nDefence” , but was said by the Bank to be unsustainable for the reasons explained by \nBryan J when rejecting the similar “Circular Credit point” in National Bank Trust  v. \nYurov  [2020] EWHC 100 (Comm) (“Yurov ”) at [1197ff].  \n41. The Defendants’ arguments as to the means by which the claims arising out of the \nMisappropriation were discharged  (and in particular how that occurred on what were \nsaid to be repayments of what were said to be loans) have developed during the course \nof the trial .  However, the overarching argument is that , whatever loss the Bank may \nhave sustained from the operation of the loan recycling scheme as a whole, the Bank \nhas not established that any shortfall arising from the Unreturned Prepayments , or \nindeed any  other alleged loss , is properly payable as compensation for the \nMisappropriation on which the Bank sues.  \n42. Although Mr Kolomoisky continued to deny that he was in any way responsible for the \nunlawful conduct alleged by the Bank, the Repayment Defence (combined as it was \nwith the Bank’s arguments on loss) was one of the two principal matters on which he \nconcentr ated in his closing submissions.  He did not shrink from the fact that it relies \non a single -minded focus on precisely how the Bank has formulated  its case .  He \nsubmitted  that it was important for the court not to be distracted by looking at the losses \nwhich might have flowed from the operation of the scheme as a whole  rather than the \nlosses which flowed from the specific misappropriations on which the Bank has chosen \nto sue , driven as it was by its desire to litigate in this jurisdiction through the anchor of \nthe English Defendants’ presence here .  He said that , in the light of the Bank’s own \nexpert evidence,  the Repayment Defence  was a complete answer to its claim and, in \nsome respects, everything else was subsidiary to his case on this point.  I shall deal with \nit in detail later in this judgment.   \n43. The Defendants also pleaded  defence s that the Bank’s claims are time -barred  (the \n“Limitation Defence”) and the Individual Defendants also pleaded that the Bank is \nprecluded from pursuing its claims by operation of the doctrine of venire contra factum \nproprium  (a prohibition against inconsistent conduct)  as it is applied under Ukrainian \nlaw.  I shall come back to limitation in more detail later in this judgment, but it is worth \nidentifying the parameters of the dispute at this stage , not least because , by th e close of \nthe trial , it had come to play a much more significant ro le in the Defendants’ defence \nthan had b een apparent when the case was opened  and was the second of the two main \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n16 \n matters on which Mr Mark Howard KC concentrated in his closing submissions  on \nbehalf of Mr Kolomoisky . \n44. Article s 257 and 261(1)  of the Civil Code  (“Article 257” and “Article 261” \nrespectively) provide for a limitation peri od of three years  from the date when the \nclaimant becam e, or could have become aware of the violation of its right or the person \nwho violated such right .  There is no dispute that  the Relevant Loans, the Relevant \nDrawdowns, the RSAs and the Unreturned Prepayments were all executed or made in \nor before September 2014.

However, t he Bank contend ed \nthat this defence is no answer to its claim , because it did not have the necessary actual \nor constructive knowledge for more than the requisite three -year period .  It also \ncontend ed that the limitation period should be disapplied in accordance with the \nprovisions of Article 267 (5) of the Civil Code  (“Article 267(5) ”), which provides that  \nany violated right shall be protec ted i f a court finds any reasons for missing the \nlimitation period to be valid . \n45. As to venire contra factum proprium , this defence bears some similarity to the English \nlaw principle that a person may not approbate and reprobate.  It is said to preclude the \nBank from contending that any of the Relevant , Intermediary or New  Loans is void or \nvoidable because the Bank has treated them as valid in other Ukrainian proceedings .  \nThe Bank contends that  this doctrine does not give the Defendants a defence , both \nbecause it never acted in bad faith in the other proceedings it commenced in Ukraine , \nand because  the Individual Defendants did not act to their detriment in reliance on what \nwas said to be the Bank’s preclusively inconsistent conduct .  However, in his written \nand oral closing submissions , Mr Kolomoisky said that he no longer needed to rely on \nthe defence of venire contra factum proprium .  It was no longer necessary  because  of \nthe argument  he made in closing to the effect that the Bank was bound by its choice to \ntreat the Borrowers as having repaid their liabilities in respect of the Relevant Loans . \n \nThe nature of the evidence : legal principles  \n46. I now turn  to explain the nature of the evidence with which the court was faced  at the \ntrial and the approach which the court should adopt to making the necessary findings \nof fact in a case of this sort .  I do so in circumstances in which t here are many aspects \nof what occurred on which there is no direct documentary or oral evidence.  In part, this \nis because the documentary record  was demonstrably deficient in a number of highly \nmaterial respects , and it is clear that much documentation which did exist has either \nbeen destroyed or suppressed .  It was also because t here was a dearth of witnesses ; \nmany who  could have given evidence on issues central to the Bank’s claim  were not \ncalled to do so.  Circumstantial evidence therefore forms an impor tant part of the Bank’s \ncase.   \n47. There was no dispute at the trial that the general approach to proving a case in fraud \nwas comprehensively summarised by Bryan J in JSC BM Bank  v. Kekhman  [2018] \nEWHC 791 (Comm) (“Kekhman ”) at [41] - [92] and Yurov  at [50 ].  For present \npurposes, it is not necessary to recite those passages in full.  The following headline \npoints suffice:  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n17 \n i) Fraud or dishonesty must be distinctly alleged and distinctly proved; it must be \nsufficiently particularised, and it is not sufficiently particularised if the facts \npleaded are consistent with innocence or negligence.  \nii) As in an ordinary civil claim, the burden of proof is on the claimant and the fact \nthat fraud is alleged does not change the standard of proof from being the \nbalance of probability.  When assessing the probabilities, the court will have in \nmind, to whatever extent is appropriate in the particular case, that the more \nserious the allegation the less likely it is that the event occurred and, hence, the \nstronger should be the evidence before the court concludes that the allegation is \nestabl"}

But care must be taken in working out what  in a particular \ncase is inherently probable or improbable. It is generally correct that  absent other \ninformation, the more serious the wrongdoing, the less likely it is that it  was \ncarried out, because most people are not serious wrongdoers.  The standard of \nproof  remains the same, but more cogent evidence is required to prove fraud \nthan to prove  negligence or innoc ence because the evidence has to outweigh the \ncountervailing  inherent improbability.  \niv) Memories are fallible, people can convince themselves of the veracity of false \nrecollections of  events and retain confidence in their false recollection, and a \njudge’s ability to evaluate  honesty and reliability merely from a witness’s \ndemeanour is also fallible.  Therefore,  where possible, a court should rely on \ndocumentary evidence and any other objectively  provable facts.  \nv) The nature of circumstantial evidence is that its effect is cumulative, and the \nessence of a successful case based on circumstantial evidence is that the whole \nis stronger than individual parts.  \nvi) Hearsay evidence of a witness who has not been cross -examined is generally \ngiven less weight than the evidence of a witness who  has been called and cross -\nexamined and had their evidence tested in cross -examination.  \n48. These principles are all well known, but of particular significance in the present case is \nBryan J’s comment about circumstantial evidence , which was derived from what Rix \nLJ had to say in JSC BTA Bank  v. Ablyazov & Others  [2012] EWCA Civ 1411 , [2013] \n1 WLR 1331  (“Ablya zov”) at [52]:  \n“It is, however, the essence of a successful case of circumstantial evidence that the \nwhole is stronger than individual parts. It becomes a net from which there is no \nescape. That is why a jury is often directed to avoid piecemeal consideration of a \ncircum stantial case”.  \n49. Ablyazov  was a case where the standard of proof was beyond all reasonable doubt, but \nin Kekhman  at [79], Bryan J noted that the points made by Rix LJ were equally apt in \nthe context of civil fraud, while in Lakatamia Shipping Co Ltd  v. Su [2021] EWHC \n1907  (“Lakatamia ”) at [64], he explained that they are of general application.  In \nLakatamia  at [65],  drawing on the decision of the Court of Appeal in Bank St \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n18 \n Petersburg PJSC  v. Arkhangelsky  [2020] EWCA Civ 408, [2020] 4 WLR 55 at [70], \nhe then summarised the position as follows:  \n“In this regard, and consistently with Rix LJ’s observations, in evaluating the \nevidence it is best to avoid compartmentalising particular points relied upon, or \ntreating points in “silos”, or adopting a piecemeal approach to evidence relied upon; \nrather i t is appropriate to take account of “previous findings in considering the \nlikelihood of the later facts having occurred” or, in other words, to “stand … back \nand consider … the effects of the implications of the facts … found in the round”.”  \n50. It is also highly relevant, as was submitted by Ms Clare Montgomery KC on behalf of \nMr Bogolyubov, that the Ukrainian context is part of the background against which the \ninherent probabilities of the Bank’s case fall to be evaluated ( a point made in Avonwick \nHoldings Ltd  v. Azitio Holdings Ltd  [202"}
{"start": 59500, "text": "in considering the \nlikelihood of the later facts having occurred” or, in other words, to “stand … back \nand consider … the effects of the implications of the facts … found in the round”.”  \n50. It is also highly relevant, as was submitted by Ms Clare Montgomery KC on behalf of \nMr Bogolyubov, that the Ukrainian context is part of the background against which the \ninherent probabilities of the Bank’s case fall to be evaluated ( a point made in Avonwick \nHoldings Ltd  v. Azitio Holdings Ltd  [2020] EWHC 1844 (Comm) [104] -[105] by \nPicken J).  The need for the court to adopt a cautious approach in such a context has \nbeen emphasised in many other judgments: see e.g. Berezovsky  v. Abramovich  [2012] \nEWHC 2463 (Comm) at [38]  and Filatona Trading Ltd  v. Navigator Equities Ltd  \n[2019] EWHC 173 (Comm) at [12].  What is inherently probable in a secure banking \nsector, governed by the UK regulators, is not necessarily inherently probable in the \nconditions that prevailed in the Ukrainian banking sector between 2000 and 2016.  \n51. It was submitted on behalf of Mr Bogolyubov that the relevant back -story in the present \ncase is one in which related party lending and problems about bank capitalisation were \nnot a source of any particular concern in Ukraine prior to 2014. It was said that they \nwere therefore not the subject of any significant scrutiny.  It was also said that Ukraine \nwas a jurisdiction in which “businessmen habitually held their assets in byzantine \nstructures designed to defy penetration” .  In that regard, the NBU’s 2014 an nual report \nobserved that it was not until the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014 that there was any \neffort by the NBU to impose modern and transparent procedures for monitoring and \nreporting related party lending or for disclosing the identity of a bank’s  owners.  \n52. I accept that all of these considerations must be given weight when seeking to determine \nthe appropriate inferences to draw as to what the Individual Defendants are likely to \nhave known and approved.  The same considerations are also important when seeking  \nto assess whether conduct is or is not commercially acceptable for the purposes of \ndetermining the likelihood that it did in fact occur.  But it is important to recognise that \nthis point goes both ways.  It is of course the case that it is appropriate to assess the \nprobability of Mr Bogolyubov having a particular state of mind or knowledge against \nthe background of what was said to be “the laissez faire  economic context evident in \nstates like Ukraine emerging from the breakup of the Soviet Union”.  But it is also \nappropriate to recognise that a less regulated system may be more vulnerable to abusive \nconduct by powerful and influential businessmen conditi oned to treat the assets of \ncompanies which they control (and even companies as large as the Bank) as if they \nwere their own.  \n53. However, another important aspect of the evidence is the inferences the court is invited \nto draw from (a) the decision of the Individual Defendants not to give evidence  (which \nin the case of Mr Kolomoisky was only conveyed shortly before the start of the trial) , \n(b) the decision of Mr Kolomoisky (again conveyed at the last minute)  not to call the \nwitnesses of fact whose evidence had been foreshadowed by the service of statements, \n(c) the decisions made by the Individual Defendants not to adduce evidence fro m a \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n19 \n number of witnesses  who had relevant evidence to give, whose position appeared to be \nsympathetic to the Individual Defendants and who were available to do so  and (d) \ndeficiencies in the disclosure of documents throughout the very lengthy period between \nthe commencement of these proceedings and the trial.  \n54.

The court’s approach  to the drawing of adverse inferences from the absence of a witness \nis explained in  the judgment of  Lord Leggatt JSC in Efobi  v. Royal Mail Group Ltd  \n[2021] UKSC 33, [2021] 1 WLR 3863 , which is now t he leading authority  on the point .  \nHe said at [41]:  \n“The question whether an adverse inference may be drawn from the absence of a \nwitness is sometimes treated as a matter governed by legal criteria …. … I think \nthere is a risk of making overly legal and technical what really is or ought to be just \na matter of ordinary rationality. So far as possible, tribunals should be free to draw, \nor to decline to draw, inferences from the facts of the case before them using their \ncommon sense without the need to consult law books when doing so. Whether any \npositive signi ficance should be attached to the fact that a person has not given \nevidence depends entirely on the context and particular circumstances. Relevant \nconsiderations will naturally include such matters as whether the witness was \navailable to give evidence, wha t relevant evidence it is reasonable to expect that \nthe witness would have been able to give, what other relevant evidence there was \nbearing on the point(s) on which the witness could potentially have given relevant \nevidence, and the significance of those points in the context of the case as a whole. \nAll these matters are inter -related and how these and any other relevant \nconsiderations should be assessed cannot be encapsulated in a set of legal rules.”  \n55. In the present case, most of the considerations identified by Lord Leggatt are indeed \nintimately inter -related.  I have reached the clear conclusion that the Defendants ’ \ndecision not to call any witnesses was made , anyway in part,  because of a well-founded \nfear that their own roles in the Misappropriation would be more likely to be exposed \nduring the course of any cross -examination were they to do so .  But similar  \nconsiderations may also be material to the evidence called by the Bank, in any event \ninsofar a s it related to the Limitation Defence.   Having regard to that, I will deal first \nwith the Bank’s witnesses and the impressions I formed of them in the witness box.   I \nwill then consider the significance of the Defendants ’ decisions  not to call any evidence \nin support of their respective cases .  I will defer dealing with the Defendants’ \nsubmission s on the failure of the Bank to call a number of witnesses on issues relating \nto the Limitation Defence until later in the judgment.   \n \nThe witnesses of fact called by the Bank  \n56. The Bank called ten witnesses of fact, six of whom were cross -examined, but four of \nwhom were not.  It was regrettable that the Defendants’ decision not to cross -examine \nthree of the four was made very late in the day because they had already made the \ndifficult journey from Ukraine by the time that decision was communic ated to the Bank \nand the court.  In the event, the cross -examination that was carried out focused, albeit \nnot exclusively, on limitation issues.  I will first explain my impression of the witnesses \nwho attended for cross -examination and then give a short s ummary of the issues to \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n20 \n which the evidence of the four witnesses who were not called for cross -examination \nrelates.  \n57.

The first to give oral evidence for the Bank was Kateryna Rozhkova.  She joined the \nNBU in June 2015 as director of its banking supervision unit and is now its First Deputy \nGovernor (having first been appointed its acting Deputy Governor in January 2016).  \nShe therefore held, and continues to hold, a  senior position in a n important Ukrainian \nstate institution.   She is responsible for  maintaining financial stability, as well as the \nregulation of Ukraine’s banking sector.  Her evidence covered the purpose and  effect \nof Ukraine’s banking reforms between 2014 and 2016, the NBU’s regulation of the \nBank during that period and her experiences of dealing with the Individual Defendants.  \nHer evidence, much of which was unchallenged, was also directed at disputing Mr \nKolomoisky’s abandoned case that the Bank was nationalised as a result of a political \ncampaign directed against him.  \n58. In their cross -examinations of Ms Rozhkova, Mr Howard concentrated on questions \nthat went to the L imitation Defence, while Ms Montgomery concentrated on what Ms \nRozhkova  knew about her client’s involvement in the affairs of the Bank.   In his closing \nsubmissions, it was said by Mr Howard that Ms Rozhkova was not a straightforward \nwitness and Ms Mon tgomery said that she was combative and unwilling to accept \nobvious propositions.  It was said that she would often respond to questions by \nanswering a different o ne, or by resorting to formulaic responses about what should \nhave been done and that she obviously had an agenda and prepared mantra, attempting \nto protect the Bank’s position as best she could.  \n59. While there is some substance to the Defendants’ criticisms of Ms Rozhkova, I do not \nthink that overall it is a fair summary of the way in which she gave her evidence.   \nAlthough  many of her answers wandered off the point, there were a number of \noccasions on which I was not convinced that she fully understood the questions she had \nbeen asked.  However, I agree that she was a witness who tried to anticipate where the \nquestioning was  going and I was also left with the impression that there were occasions \non wh ich she did not want to answer the question that was put to her.   Nonetheless, and \nhaving regard to the fact that her English was not perfect and she sometimes struggled \nfor that reason, I agree with the Bank’s submission that in all material respects her \nevidence was truthful  and of assistance to the court. \n60. I should  also record that I agree with the Bank’s submission that Ms Rozhkova \ndemonstrated considerable courage in giving evidence for the Bank in circumstances in \nwhich Mr Kolomoisky had in the past made serious threats against her.  The \nunchallenged evidence est ablished that this conduct included  (i) threats  in 2016  to \nrelease her private phone records and messages into the public domain; (ii) threats in \nOctober 2016, which was shortly before the Bank’s nationalisation, that he could find \nher anywhere and compari ng himself to “a hungry tiger in a cage” , after which she \nrefused to carry on meeting him;  and (iii) as late as December 2019 (i.e., shortly after \nthe Court of Appeal had determined that this court has jurisdiction to try the Bank’s \nclaim and that the WFO against the Individual Defendants should continue until trial) , \norganising a  threatening  protest outside her home whilst her eight -year-old daughter \nwas also in the house , requiring her to take a police escort to work , a protest which he \nthen recorded in a  congratulatory exchange with Mr Bogolyubov over WhatsApp .  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n21 \n 61.

These threats are consistent with other conduct by Mr Kolomoisky, which cannot \nsimply be brushed aside as the conduct of a businessman accustomed to getting his own \nway.   The culture within the Bank was submissive and unquestioning to instruction \ngiven by those senior in the hierarchy, at the head of which were Mr Kolomoisky \nhimself and (albeit to a much less pronounced extent) Mr Bogolyubov.  In particular, \nthese threats and this culture, are of relevance to the Bank’s case on limitation, and \nmore especial ly that it is unrealistic to think that any employee of the Bank would or \ncould have caused the Bank to initiate legal proceedings against the Individual \nDefendants in 2014 when aspects of the Misappropriation were first made public.  I will \nrevert to them  in that context.  \n62. I should also record that Ms Rozhkova gave evidence about a number of other very \nunpleasant threats made against her  (and indeed against the NBU ’s former governor, \nValeriya Gontareva) .  There is no direct evidence that Mr Kolomoisky was responsible \nfor making them, although she believes that he was,  and she frankly accepted that, given \nher role in cleaning up the Ukrainian banking sector, there are a lot of people who might \nbear a grudge against her.  Nonetheless, whatever their provenance, the fact that th ey \nhave been made supports the opinion I have expressed as to the courage she has shown \nin giving the evidence she gave.  \n63. The second witness who gave oral evidence was Dmitri Luchaninov, a Ukrainian \nlawyer and the Bank’s head of compliance since July 2012 .  He reported to Yuriy \nPikush , general deputy chair of the Management Board .  He also reported to Mr Dubilet \nand would take instructions from Timur Novikov , head of the Bank’s Invest ment \nBusiness and in charge of Primecap .  He gave evidence in person with the assistance of \nan interpreter.  One of the responsibilities of the compliance department was to maintain \nthe Bank’s list of related parties.  Another responsibility was to be the Bank’s point of \ncontact for the NBU and  to coordinate the collection of information in response to \nrequests from the NBU and other regulators.  In his witness statement, he explained the \ninstructions he was given by Mr Dubilet, Vladimir Yatsenko  (a first deputy chair of the \nManagement Board pre -nationalisation and head of the Bank’s corporate VIP business \ndepartment ), Mr Novikov and Tatiana Gurieva (head of the Bank’s strategic client or \ncustomer service business department known as BOK) to hide related -party affiliations \nand the steps he took to implement those instructions.  \n64. Ms Mon tgomery established in cross -examination that the evidence he gave as to the \nassumptions he had made about the role which Mr Bogolyubov played in the \nmanagement of the Bank was not underpinned by any personal observation.  He was \ncriticised for not making c lear in his witness statement that this was the case, and indeed \nit was said that this information should never have been included at all.   Although \ntempered by the fact that Mr Luchaninov was always open that this part of his statement \nwas based o n assumption, there is some force in this criticism because the assumptions \nwere not matters of fact based on material of which he had personal knowledge.  \n65. Nonetheless, I have reached the view that, while what Mr Luchaninov had to say about \nthe relationship between Mr Bogolyubov and Ms Gurieva and Mr Novikov should not \nhave been included in his "}

Nonetheless, I have reached the view that, while what Mr Luchaninov had to say about \nthe relationship between Mr Bogolyubov and Ms Gurieva and Mr Novikov should not \nhave been included in his witness statement in the form that it was, that failing did not \nhave a material effect on the quality of the remaining parts of his evidence.  In general \nI consider that, when he understood the question (which was not always the case), he \nwas doing his best to assist the court.  His evidence overall was straightforward,  credible \nand truthful.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n22 \n 66. The third witness who gave oral evidence was M arina  Lozytska.  Throughout the \nrelevant period until nationalisation she worked in the Bank’s head office in Dnipro as \ndeputy head of the client banking service division of the client operations accounting \ndepartment of BOK.  One of her duties was to update the Bank’s related party lists for \nBOK clients.  She continues to work at the Bank as head of the department for record -\nkeeping of client operations also known as NURA, based in Dnipro.  She travelled to \nLondon to give her evidence in person via an interpreter.  \n67. In her evidence she explained that the documentation for which she was responsible \nincluded material relating to a client’s registration as a legal entity, its corporate \nownership structure and information on individuals with the right to act on its behalf .  \nShe was responsible for the regular updating of the list of BOK clients which showed \nsigns of being related to the Bank. Her general understanding was that many of BOK’s \nclients were companies and other entities falling within the industry sectors in wh ich \nthe Individual Defendants held business interests , particularly in the oil, metallurgy, \nmining and transport industries.  Her assumption at the time was that many of them \nwere companies which were ultimately beneficially owned by the Individual \nDefendants.  \n68. She gave evidence about the close relationship that she assumed existed between Mr \nDubilet, Ms Gurieva, Mr Novikov, Mr Yatsenko and Lyubov Chmona (head of the \nBank’s budgeting department) , on the one hand , and the Individual Defendants , on the \nother.  It was said on behalf of Mr Bogolyubov in closing that her cross -examination \nrevealed that what were called her “carefully crafted assumptions” about his supposed \nrelationships with the Bank’s management were not based on her personal knowledge.  \nWhether or no t it is correct to characterise her assumptions as carefully crafted, I agree \nthey were of limited evidential value, based as they were on assumptions derived from \nthe structure of the Bank’s management committees and the Supervisory Board.  She \nalso gave first-hand evidence about the role of PBC and Sergei Melnyk , its head, in \nmanaging the affairs of BOK’s customers.  \n69. In Mr Bogolyubov’s closing submissions, it was also said that Ms Lozytska was a \ndifficult and evasive witness.  In my view she was certainly forceful in the way that she \ngave her evidence and clear in her perspective as to what was going on.  However, \nalthough I agree that she was inclined to jump to conclusions based on what she \nunderstood the position to be, rather than conc entrating only on matters within her own \ndirect personal knowledge , I do not think that she was evasive . \n70. The fourth witness who gave oral evidence was Sergiy Oleksiyenko.

He gave his evidence in English.  His evidence \nexplained, from the perspective of the Supervisory Board, the many pressures faced by \nthe Bank in the first half of 2017 immediately after nationalisation.   He explained why \npotential  claims against the Individual Defendants were investigated seriously from \nAugust 2017 and how the decision to institute the present proceedings was taken, \ntogether with the need for extra security to prevent the leakage of information.  His \nevidence was t herefore primarily concerned with issues which went only to the \nLimitation Defence.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n23 \n 71. Mr Oleksiyenko was subjected to a forceful cross -examination over a period of more \nthan one day.  His evidence was criticised in Mr Kolomoisky’s closing submissions as \nhaving originally omitted a number of important facts and matters and some of his \nconcessions were characterised as reluctant or forced upon him.  It was also said that \nhe misled the court by pretending that some of the language he used in his witness \nstatement was his own, when it was said to be obvious that words had been put into his \nmouth .  I agree with some of the criticisms levelled at Mr Oleksiyenko because  it was \nplain from his cross -examination that his witness  statement did not always give a \nrounded description of what he and his colleagues in the new management team knew \nand learnt both at and shortly after they were appointed at the time the Bank was \nnationalised.   \n72. However, I do not accept many of the criticisms made of Mr Oleksiyenko in Mr \nKolomoisky’s closing submissions.  In my view, he was a clear and precise witness.  \nHe was often accused of not answering questions in circumstances in which the \naccusation was not justifi ed.  Despite that he kept his composure and was prepared to \nmake concessions, whether or not such concessions might have been thought to damage \nthe Bank’s case, and I do not think it is right to characterise those concessions as \nreluctant.  There were occasions on which he was criticised for not being full in his \nanswers but more often than not this was driven by his desire to ensure that the answers \nhe gave were precise.  I think that he was an honest witness who gave clear evidence \nand did his best to assist the court.  \n73. The fifth witness who gave oral evidence was Irina Hryn.  She was an in -house lawyer \nat the Bank between 2011 and 2022.  She gave her evidence in Ukrainian via video link \nfrom Kyiv.  Her evidence related to a number of claims against the New Borrowers \nwhic h were filed in the name of the Bank in late 2017.  She explained that her signature \nwas forged on the papers, evidence on which she was cross -examined, but which in the \nevent was not challenged by Mr Kolomoisky in closing.  She also gave more general \nevidence in relation to the Bank’s debt collection procedures more particularly where \nthe amount outstanding was greater than UAH 200,000.  \n74. Although there were occasions on which Ms Hryn had difficulty in describing \nstructures within the Bank’s claims and legal department, Mr Kolomoisky did not \ncriticise her veracity in his closing submissions and Mr Bogolyubov accepted that she \nwas generally a straightforward witness.

I agree that she gave evidence in a \nstraightforward manner and I accept the s ubstance of what she had to say.  \n75. The sixth witness, and the last one to attend for cross -examination, was Galyna \nPakhachuk, who was working for the Ministry of Finance prior to the Bank’s \nnationalisation.  She gave evidence in person through an interpreter.  She was appointed \nto the Management Board five days after nationalisation and remained in post until 31 \nAugust  2021.  Initially, she was deputy chair of the Management Board but was \nappointed acting chair on 25 July 2017 when the chairman ( Oleksandr Shlapak) \nresigned.  She continued to  occupy the position of acting chair until the appointment of \na new chairman in January 2018.  At the time she made her witness statement, Ms \nPakhachuk was acting as an advisor to the chairman of the Management Board.  \n76. The main thrust of Ms Pakhachuk’s evidence was the complexity and difficulty of the \nrole required to be performed by the Bank’s new management team in the period after \nnationalisation.  These difficulties included the need to avoid a run on the Bank, \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n24 \n overcoming the lack of important documentation, building a new organisational \nstructure and dealing with employees who appeared to remain loyal to the Individual \nDefendants.  Her evidence was to the effect that the Bank’s claim in these proceedings \nwas ins tituted as soon as reasonably practicable, and to that extent went to the \nLimitation Defence.  \n77. In closing submissions, Mr Kolomoisky did not make specific criticism of the way in \nwhich Ms Pakhachuk gave her evidence, although he relied on a number of aspects of \nher evidence in which he said that she made concessions on which he relied.  However, \nMr Bogolyubov was more critical.  He submitted that Ms Pakhachuk was a combative \nwitness who would not accept obvious points.  He also submitted that it was apparent \nfrom the cross -examination that her witness statement was replete with exaggeration, \nin parti cular where it dealt with matters relating to the loyalty which Bank employees \nhad to Mr Bogolyubov.  \n78. In my view, Ms Pakhachuk was quite defensive in the way she responded to parts of \nher cross -examination.  She was inclined to give speeches about issues on which she \nfelt strongly, rather than concentrating on the questions she was asked and there were \noccasions in which, having been riled by the cross -examiner, she allowed her frustration \nto show.  Nonetheless, I do not think that she intended to mislead the court in any of \nthe evidence that she gave, and I accept the truth of what she had to say.  \n \nThe Bank’s other evidence of fact  \n79. The first of the four witnesses whose evidence was admitted without cross -examination \nwas Olena Pogorelaya.  Prior to nationalisation, she worked as one of five deputy heads \nof the Bank’s corporate VIP business loan department.  She explained that her work  \ninvolved assisting the Bank’s Cyprus branch in the finalisation of loan documentation, \nwhich was often to be backdated, and explained that Mr Yatsenko’s secretary was also \ninvolved in arranging for execution both by the Bank and by the purported counterpa rty.  \nShe said that the culture within the Bank was such that employees did not question or \nrefuse to comply with instructions given by their superiors and that she was sure that \nshe would have lost her job if she had refused to perform a task she had been  asked to \ncarry out and that she could not afford to take that risk.

I have no doubt that she was \nright about that.  \n80. Ms Pogorelaya also gave evidence of her experience of the way in which nominees \nwere put in place for the Bank’s clients.  Thus, she was paid to act as a director of one \nof the Bank’s clients and acted as a shareholder for other clients although she did no t \nattend or vote at any shareholders’ meetings in that capacity. She gave evidence that \nmany of the shareholders of clients serviced through her department were employees \nof the Bank and was confident that none of her colleagues had any real interest of their \nown in the companies concerned.  \n81. The second of the four witnesses who se evidence was admitted without cross -\nexamination was Ruslana Domashenko.  She was appointed curator of the Bank in \nFebruary 2015 in succession to Olena Zarutska who had been appointed by the NBU \non 11 September 2014.  Her main function was to monitor the Bank’s compliance and \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n25 \n to report to the NBU’s oversight department with daily information.  It was not her role \nto instruct or direct the Bank on how to conduct its operations and she did not do so.  \n82. Ms Domashenko’s main point of contact within the Bank was Mr Luchaninov.  She \nunderstood that her role was to be the ears and eyes of the NBU, but she had no role in \ninstructing or directing the Bank in the conduct of its operations and only limited access  \nto the Bank’s documents and electronic systems.  She did not attend Supervisory Board \nor Management Board meetings and did not recall attending any ECC meetings.  In \nparticular she denied that she supervised or controlled the implementation of the \nTransfo rmation as had been alleged in Mr Kolomoisky’s Defence, although she did \nhave what she described as a very limited role in monitoring its implementation.  \n83. The third of the Bank’s witnesses whose  evidence was  admitted without cross -\nexamination was  Mykhailo Shekmar.  He is a senior member of the NBU’s bank \ninspection team and, at the time of his witness statement, was the deputy head of one \nof the four directorates within the NBU’s inspections department. The head of the \ninspections department of th e NBU reports to the Deputy Governor for Banking \nSupervision; i n 2016 this was Ms Rozhkova.  He carried out a scheduled inspection of \nthe Bank between 8 February 201 6 and 1 July 2016 and an unscheduled inspection of \nthe Bank between 17 October 2016 and 31 December 2016.  \n84. His evidence was concerned with the role of the inspection team.  He also explained \nwhy Mr Kolomoisky was wrong to plead in his Defence that the purpose of the \nunscheduled inspection was to ensure that the NBU could procure the Bank’s \nnationalisation before the Transformation was complete with the consequence that any \nlosses caused to the Bank arising out of the New Loans was caused  by the NBU, not by \nMr Kolomoisky.  He also gave evidence about the difficulties which the inspection team \nhad in obtaining app ropriate documentation and other information from the Bank in \nrelation to matters relevant to the inspection.  \n85. The fourth of the Bank’s witnesses who did not give oral evidence at the trial was \nValerii Bondarenko.

He is a senior lawyer in the Bank’s legal department having joined \nthe Bank in October 2013.  He was working in the Bank’s claims department in 2017 \nand gave evidence about the Bank’s standard procedures for issuing claims against \ncorporate borrowers who are in default. He was involved in the preparation and \nsubmission of claims against the New Borrowers in the latter part of 2017.  H e gave \nevidence that,  although at some stage after October 2017 he had been instructed by the \ndeputy head of the claims department not to file any further claims against New \nBorrowers, some claims were discovered which appeared to bear his signature.  He \nconfirmed that his sig natures on some of the relevant documentation were forged.  \n \nWitnes ses not called by the Bank  \n86. In the closing submissions prepared on his behalf, Mr Kolomoisky said that it was \nstriking that, despite what he called “the prima facie  expiry” of the limitation period in \nrespect of many of its claims before the issue of these proceedings, the Bank chose not \nto tender evidence from anyone to explain what the Bank did and did not know about \nthe violation of its rights before 21 December 2 014.  In particular, he said that it was \nnoticeable that the Bank did not call evidence from a number of witnesses who w ere \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n26 \n better informed about what was being done in relation to the preparation of the 2014 \nUkrainian Proceedings (an issue which is relevant to the Limitation Defence) than \neither Mr Oleksiyenko or Ms Pakhachuk.  He also criticised the Bank for its failure to \ncall evidence from anyone at the NBU who was able to speak to what it (and the Bank) \nknew throughout the period from the time of the making of Relevant Loan s in 2014 \nuntil 2017.  It was suggested that Ms Domashenko and Ms Rozhkova were only able to \ngive evid ence about the period from 2015.   It was said that this, together with the \nabsence of disclosure by the NBU of any relevant documentation, should lead to an \ninference that the NBU’s documentary record would not support the case formulated \nby the Bank in t hese proceedings.  \n87. On the issue of disclosure, Mr Kolomoisky relied on the fact that at an earlier stage in \nthe proceedings there was a dispute as to whether the Bank should be ordered to treat a \nnumber of the NBU’s employees as custodians for the purposes of its disclosure \nexercise.  I was not addressed on the outcome of that dispute, in which issues as to \nbanking confidentiality as between the Bank and the NBU seem to have been raised, \nbut the court was never asked to resolve the question of whether documents in the \nphysica l possession of the NBU relating to the Bank were disclosable by the Bank in \nthese proceedings (on the grounds that they were in the Bank’s control), nor was there \nany evidence as to whether the Defendants could have sought evidence -gathering relief \nin Ukr aine against the NBU in aid of these proceedings.  \n88. In large part, these considerations related to the Limitation Defence and, as will appear, \nI have had regard to them both  in evaluating the inferences which it is appropriate for \nme to draw and in the ultimate conclusions that I have reached.  I have also had regard \nto the fact that the NBU’s witnesses gave their evidence in support of the Bank’s case \nwithout compulsion and, to that extent, the NBU was cooperating with the Bank \nthroughout these proceedings.

I will revert \nto the question of documentary evidence more generally  a little later in this judgment . \n \nAbsence of oral evidence from the Individual Defendants   \n89. It is plain that both Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov had highly relevant evidence \nto give on many of the issues which were always bound to arise at the trial.  They ranged \nfrom the disputed extent of their control of the Bank  and what the Bank called (in a \nphrase which I shall adopt) the “Relevant Enti ties”, i.e., the Borrowers , the Intermedia ry \nBorrowers, the New Borrowers , the Corporate Defendants  and the ED Principals , to \ntheir knowledge of and involvement in the making of the Relevant Loans and the \nMisappropriation  more generally .  These points are all very significant in the context \nof the case as a whole and I think that the Bank was justified in submitting that, if the \nIndividual Defendants had not been involved in what had occurred to the extent alleged \nby the Bank, they would  have been anxious to give their side of the story in order to \nclear their names.  \n90. As to Mr Kolomoisky’s own availability to give evidence, initially he applied for and \nwas granted permission to do so by  video link  and subsequently made  a witness \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n27 \n statement confirm ing his “willing[ness] to travel to the Fairmont Grand Hotel in Kyiv \n… to give my evidence at Trial” .  He made this statement on 11 April 2023 , two months \nbefore the start of the trial , in response to a case management order seeking to regulate \nthe taking of oral evidence at the trial.  The order recited that nothing in it affected Mr \nKolomoisky’s right to choose not to give evidence at trial, and he reiterated that point \nin his statemen t, but from the way he expressed himself, he had not a t that stage decided \nthat he would not give evidence and there was no indication that there was any \nimpediment to him doing so.  He continued to maintain that position until less than \nthree weeks before the start of trial when the court and the Bank were i nformed that he \nwould not be giving evidence after all.  \n91. In Mr Kolomoisky’s closing submissions, the explanation for his non -attendance \n(advanced o nly o n instructions) was that, o ver the last year or so, he had been  under \nincreasing public scrutiny in Ukraine , that his home was searched on 1 February 2023 \nand that he had been  arrest ed over the summer.   The court was informed that Mr \nKolomoisky  remain ed detained in Ukraine at the time his closing submissions  were \nfiled and it was submitted that  it is unsurprising that in such circumstances he should \nprefer to keep  his powder dry, particularly where the claims in England can be shown \nto be misconceived without the need for him to give evidence . \n92. This submission requires a little bit of unpacking because, even though it has been \nwidely reported that Mr Kolomoisky is now in detention, there can be  no suggestion \nthat his decision not to give evidence was driven by unavailability.  Although he made \nhis decision not to give evidence at the last minute, it was made before there was any \nsuggestion that he had been or might be detained and there is no ev idence that a way \ncould not have been found to enable him to give evidence by video -link, as was the \noriginal intention, if he had been prepared to"}

What it does raise, however, is an argument that there were relevant, and Mr \nKolomoisky would say powerful, reasons why he cannot be criticised for not giving \nevidence, one of which might be called the collateral impact on him of giving evidence \nin England .  The reference to keeping his powder dry gives rise to the question of \nwhether it is justifiable for Mr Kolomoisky to contend that he should not be exposed to \ncross -examination in English proceedings because his evidence on relevant matters \nmight have an  adverse effect on him elsewhere.  The difficulty with that submission is \nthat no details were given as to how or why that might be the case.  In the absence of \nany particularisation from Mr Kolomoisky (let alone any evidence from him or anybody \nelse) as t o precisely how and why his appearance as a witness in English proceedings \nmight have the effect o f prejudicing his defence to the unparticularised charges with \nwhich he is or may be fac ing in Ukraine, I cannot accept that considerations of this type \nshoul d have any material impact on the inferences which it is appropriate for me to \ndraw.  \n94. The position is similar in relation to the suggestion that Mr Kolomoisky did not need to \ngive evidence because the Bank’s claim is misconceived.  I cannot assess with any real \naccuracy the extent to which he might have had confidence in the merits of his o wn \ndefence, but I am satisfied that he must have known that he was at serious risk of \nliability being established against him so long as the Bank was able to continue with \nthese proceedings through to trial.  This would have been apparent to him from the t ime \nat which the Court of Appeal confirmed in the context of the Defendants’ jurisdiction \nchallenge s that the Bank had a good arguable case to recover the full US$1.9 billion \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n28 \n claimed arising out of his participation in a fraud on an epic scale ( JSC Commercial \nBank Privatbank  v. Kolomoisky and others  [2019] EWCA Civ 1708 , [2020] Ch 783 at \n[211] and [256]).  \n95. Even if Mr Kolomoisky had thought that the structural deficiencies he says are manifest \nin the Bank’s claim had become better -founded during the course of preparing the case \nfor trial, or that he might prevail in the Li mitation Defence, that does not explain his \nnon-attendance.  Nothing which occurred between the time at which he was expressing \nan intention to give evidence and the time at which he announced that he would not so \ndo, can have affected the merits of the Repayment De fence and the Limitation Defence \nto such an extent that it can possibly have been thought that he did not still have relevant \nevidence to give on significant points for the case as a whole.  In my judgment, a much \nmore significant reason for his failure to give evidence was what he knew would be the \nenhanced likelihood that, if he did so, the  extent of his involvement in the \nMisappropriation would be exposed.  From long before the time at which he was still \nasserting that he intended to give evidence, the Bank had put together a comp elling case  \nthat there was very significant wrongdoing in the conduct of the affairs of a major \nUkrainian bank in which Mr Kolomoisky (together with Mr Bogolyubov) had a \ncontrolling interest  and of which he was a member of the Super visory Board until \nnationalisation .

In my judgment, it is inconceivable that he would not have missed the \nopportunity to explain his role in what occurred if he did not have a great deal to hide.  \n96. As to Mr Bogolyubov,  it has never been suggested that he was unavailable to give \nevidence either.  He made public his decision not to do so at the pre-trial rev iew held \non 29 March 2023, but no explanation was proffered at that stage.  This was a very \nsurprising development, because of the way in which he had continued to represent \nthrough his solicitors that he intended to give evidence (albeit reserving his right to take \na final view once the case against him at the trial had been closed).  It was also su rprising \nbecause one of the bases on which he had supported the successful joint application to \nadjourn the trial made at the time of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 ( JSC \nCommercial Bank Privatbank  v. Kolomoisky and others  [2022] EWHC 775 (Ch)) was \nthat “he will be unable to prepare to give oral evidence at trial”.  \n97. He later submitted that the Bank had failed to discharge the burden of establishing a \nprima facie  case of wrongdoing by him and that the Bank could not rescue its claim by \nseeking adverse inferences from his non -attendance.  It was also submitted in the \nclosing submission made on his behalf that his election not to give evidence was made \nagainst the b ackground of considerable uncertainty and turmoil in Ukraine  and, in an \necho of what was said on behalf of Mr Kolomoisky, that:  \n“The Court can properly take the view, not least given developments over the \nsummer concerning Mr Kolomoisky, that there may be a number of reasons \nunconnected with the prospect of being cross -examined by the Bank why Mr \nBogolyubov elected not to give evidence at trial.”  \n98. I shall come back to the question of whether there is any basis for the submission that \nthe Bank’s claim failed to establish a prima facie  of wrongdoing, or that he might have \nthought that might be the case.  However, the same factors which must have caused Mr \nKolomoisky to appreciate that he was at serious risk of liability being established \nagainst him so long as the Bank was able to conti nue with these proceedings through to \ntrial also applied to Mr Bogolyubov.  The Court of Appeal’s findings on good arg uable \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n29 \n case were made against him as well.  Furthermore, the fact that his decision not to give \nevidence was announced in March sits uneasily with any suggestion that what occurred \nin the summer might be relevant to his decision not to attend and there is no evid ence \nthat it was a factor.  Arrangements for him to give evidence remotely if required could \nhave been put in place (as was already anticipated at that stage for some of the Bank’s \nwitnesses), and I am satisfied that if he had chosen to do so he could have  given \nevidence at the trial .  I do not accept that such issues were a material factor in his \ndecision not to do so.  \n99. In summary, the closing submissions for both of the Individual Defendants assert that \nwhat was happening in Ukraine (anyway in the summer of 2023) may have been \nrelevant to their decisions not to attend the trial.  However, neither of them points to \nany pa rticular event which caused them to decide that it was no longer possible for them \nto do so and there is no actual evidence that any such considerations were in fact part \nof the reason why eac"}

However, neither of them points to \nany pa rticular event which caused them to decide that it was no longer possible for them \nto do so and there is no actual evidence that any such considerations were in fact part \nof the reason why each of them chose not to attend.  In reality, what is said in thei r \nclosing submissions on this aspect of the inferences I am invited by the Bank to draw \nfrom their non -attendance is little more than speculation.  The most that can be said is \nthat Mr Kolomoisky might have wished to avoid exposing himself to cross -examination \nwhich might have had an adverse impact on his position in the legal difficulties in which \nhe finds himself in Ukraine.  \n \nOther evidence of fact  withdrawn  by Mr Kolomoisky  \n100. There is also no evidence that matters of availability affected Mr Kolomoisky’s \ndecision not to call the three other witnesses from whom he had served witness \nstatements in the latter part of 2021, i.e., 18 months or so before the start of the trial.  \nThes e statements had been made by Mr Yatsenko , Oleksandr Zavadetskyi ( head of the \nspecial monitoring unit at the NBU  concerned with unwinding related party loans  from \nJune 2015) and Konstantin Medvedev ( head of the asset management department of the \nBank’s Investment Business  from 1999 until six months after nationalisation ).  At the \ntime of the second pre-trial review  in March 2023, it was still Mr Kolomoisky’s \nintention to call these witnesses and it was said that, subject to obtaining visas, they \nwere free to travel to the UK to do so.  Even if they had not been able to obtain visas, \nthere was no indication that they  would not be available to give their evidence by video -\nlink.  Indeed, in his closing submissions, Mr Kolomoisky did not contend that the \nquestio n of availability was part of the reason for his failure to call these witnesses.  His \ncase was simply that, in light of the burden of proof and the failure of the Bank to prove \nits allegations, it was not necessary for him to do so.  \n101. Of these three putative witnesses, Mr Yatsenko  was the only one who was involved in \ndecisions relati ng to the making of the Relevant Loans and subsequent events relating \nto the Misappropriation.   Although Mr Zavadetskyi and Mr Medvedev had evidence of \nsome relevance to give on the conduct of  NBU during 2015 and the internal working \nof the Bank’s Investment Business, their evidence was not in itself central to the claim \nor its defence .  Taken alone , Mr Kolomoisky’s  failure to call them does not give rise to \ninferences adverse to any of the Defendants on the issues to which their evidence \nrelates.   The same c annot be said for Mr Yatsenko.  The Bank submitted that he was \none of the witnesses whose evidence would have been highly relevant to the issues in \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n30 \n the proceedings and that I should draw adverse inferences from Mr Kolomoisky’s \ndecisions to withdraw his statement shortly before the trial.  \n102. I agree with the Bank’s submission .  I am satisfied that Mr Yatsenko  had highly relevant \nevidence to give in relation to  many of  the matters with which these proceedings are \nconcerned .  He continued to have a relationship with the Individual Defendants post -\nnationalisation and he would have been prepared to give evidence if he had been asked \nto do so .  In particular, h e played a significant part in approving the Relevant Loans  and \nthe surviving documentary material discloses that there were a number of othe r aspects \nof the Misappropriation in which he was involved.

Thus, i n March 2015 , he was party \nto a discussion which led to  a plan for eliminating the recording of any connectio ns \nbetween the Individual Defendants and 42 of the B orrowers  (all of which were clients  \nof BOK ), and which had been identified by the NBU  as related parties .  This was \nrecorded in a document which came to be referred to in the proceedings as the \nLuchaninov e -mail.  It was relied on heavily by the Bank as reflecting the extent to \nwhich it was clear that the Individual Defendants were both intimately related to entities \nwhich were part of the Misappropriation.  He was also involved in the Asset Transfers  \nand was responsible for sending various versions of the plan for the Transformation to \nthe NBU, and for answering questions from the NBU’s inspectors in relation to it. \n103. He has continued to be in contact with the Individual Defendants  (and in close contact \nwith Mr Kolomoisky) since nationalisation .  Thus, he was one of  the members of a \ngroup , also including other members of the Management Board , who met with Mr \nKolomoisky and  Mr B ogolyubov  in Geneva shortly after the commencement of these \nproceedings .  Given the timing, which was between the commencement of these \nproceedings and the service of the Defendants’ jurisdiction challenges, it is probable \nthat the meetings related  to this litigation.  It is of course possible that they were merely \nan evidence -gathering exercise, but Mr Yatsenko’s presence explained why he can \nproperly be characterised by the Bank as one of the Individual Defendants’ loyal \nlieutenants .  In the absence of any evidence to the contrary from either of the Individual \nDefendants , it is right to infer that he  has continued to be available to them in the \nconduct and defence of these proceed ings. \n104. That is more particularly the case so far as Mr Kolomoisky is concerned, because it is \napparent from red actions  to certain WhatsApp exchanges he has had with Mr Yatsenko  \nsince the commencement of these proceedings that he and Mr Kolomoisky  have \ncontinued  to communicate with each other , exchanging  confidential information \nrelating to the commercial affairs of unidentified companies. I infer from th e \nexplanation for these red actions that Mr Kolomoisky and  Mr Yatsenko continue to have  \na close business relationship.   In like manner, in September 2018, Mr Yatsenko was \nsent by Mr Kolomoisky copies of certain draft requests for mutual legal assistance in \nrelation to an alleged fra ud on the Bank which had been sent by the Ukrainian \nauthorities to the Austrian, British, BVI, Cypriot and Luxembourgi an authorities.  As \nthey were drafts, they must have come into the hands of Mr Kolomoisky illegitimately.  \nIn my view the Bank was entitled to submit that Mr Kolomoisky obviously trusted Mr \nYatsenko not to reveal that he had obtained such material in this wa y. \n105. There is also another aspect of the relationship between Mr Yatsenko and the Individual \nDefendants which was telling.  It relates to a company called PJSC Ingosstrakh \nInsurance Company (“Ingosstrakh”), in which both Mr Kolomoisky and Mr \nBogolyubov admitted to holding an interest.  Ingosstrakh was a guarantor (with a \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n31 \n liability limited to UAH 10,000) of the Relevant Loan to Prominmet , the significance \nof which I shall deal with later in this judgment.  In February 2021, a warrant was issued \nfor the arrest of Mr Yatsenko in relation to a criminal in"}

In February 2021, a warrant was issued \nfor the arrest of Mr Yatsenko in relation to a criminal investigation by the Ukrainian \nprosecuting authorities relating to a large transfer of fun ds from the Bank to Ingosstrakh \njust before nationalisation in December 2016.   Mr Yatsenko received a tip -off and \nsought to flee Ukraine on a private jet bound for Vienna, but the prosecutor  got wind \nof his plan, had the plane turned around in mid -air, and arrested him on the runway of \nBoryspil airport in Kyiv.  Disclosed WhatsApp exchanges make clear that this \ndevelopment was of interest to both of the Individual Defendants, but of equal  \nsignificance is the fact that his thwarted escape was on an aircraft operated by Windrose \nAirlines, a company which was owned or controlled by Mr Kolomoisky and which \nfeatures in the Asset Transfers I shall describe later in this judgment.  \n \nInterlocutory witnesses not called by  the Defendant s \n106. The Bank also drew attention to the fact that three former employees of the Bank gave \nevidence for Mr Kolomoisky earlier in these proceedings and at that stage were \ntherefore available to give evidence to explain what occurred during the \nMisappropriation , the extent of the Individual Defendants’ participation in it  and the \nlikelihood that the y controlled the Relevant Entities .  The evidence they gave at the \ninterlocutory stage related (anyway in part) to how the Bank’s records were kept and \nhow BOK worked i n practice.  \n107. The first of these individuals was Oleksiy (Alexey) Kazantsev.  He worked for the Bank \nbetween 2002 and April 2018 and made a witness statement on 10 June 2018 in answer \nto the evidence adduced by the Bank on the Defendants’ jurisdiction challenge s.  He \nhad been the deputy head of client lending within BOK  and had held the position of \ndeputy head of the customer credit department .  He maintained a document which has \ncome to be called in these proceedings the “Kazantsev Spreadsheet ”.  It tracks the \nrecycling of prepayments back and forth between  Borrowers , described on the \nspreadsheet as ‘Resident’  and the Corporate Defendants , described as ‘Non -resident’ , \nand was found on his laptop .  It is evidence of an  important aspect of the Bank’s \nevidence as to how the Misapp ropriation occurred . \n108. The second of these individuals was Olga Koryak.   She was employed by the Bank \nwithin B OK between 2003 and 2016 where she was head of its legal support department  \nand responsible as coordinator for matters relating to inspections and inquiries.  She \nalso gave a witness statement (dated 9 March 2018) for Mr Kolomoisky in the context \nof the Defendants’ jurisdiction challenge s.  It was primarily concerned with a dispute \nover document destruction in July 2017, which was not relied on at the trial, but was \nalso concerned with BOK’s general working practices.

Each of these three individuals had given evidence at an earlier stage in the proceedings, \neach of them plainly had relevant evidence to give on issues that related to the merits \nof the Bank’s claim and there is no indication that any of them were no longe r available \nor willing to give evidence at the trial.   The Bank submitted that I should draw an \ninference that the Individual Defendants’ failu re to a dduce  evidence at the tria l from \nMr Kazantsev and Ms Koryak was because their evidence would have confirme d that \nthe Individual Defendants controlled  the Bank  and owned and /or controlled all of the \nRelevant Entities . \n111. To the extent that it was said by the Defendants that the Bank had not substantiated a \ncase that the individuals concerned would give evidence if requested to do so by either \nof the Individual Defendants, I do not agree that that is the correct question.  Nor do I \nagree with the effect of Mr Bogolyubov’s submission in closing that there was a burden \non the Bank to show that he had sufficient control over them to procure them to attend, \nwhich had not been discharged.  Witness statements from them had already  been served  \nby Mr Kolomoisky , and t he nature of the pre - and post -nationalisation relationship \nwhich they each had with the Individual Defendants (including instances in which they \nhad given evidence at an earlier stage in these and other proceedings) was sufficiently \nclose to mean that it was a matter for the Defendants to adduce admissible evidence as \nto why they had insufficient influence to call them as witnesses rather than the other \nway round.  \n \nOther a vailable witness not called by  the Defendant s \n112. The Bank also criticised the Defendants for not calling a number of individuals whom \nthey said had highly relevant evidence to give, having been at the centre of the events \ndescribed by the Bank as the Misappropriation.  They included the individuals, whos e \nrole and relationship with the Individual Defendants I shall summarise in the next few \nparagraphs.  I n each instance, i t was said by the Bank that  the issues on which they had \nrelevant evidence to give were central to the Bank’s claim, t hat they continue d to be \navailable to give evidence on behalf of the Individual Defendants had they chosen to \ncall them and that it was likely  that the evidence they had to give would have had an \nadverse impact on the Defendant’s case by exposing the extent of their knowledge of \nand participation in the making of the Relevant Loans and the Misappropriation  more \ngenerally . None of the Defendants suggested that any of these individuals would have \nbeen willing to give evidence on behalf of the Bank , a submission which is suppo rted \nby the nature of the relationship they have continued to have with the Defendants.  \n113. The most significant  issue on which it is said that several of them would have been able \nto give important evidence is the extent to which the acts, omissions and decisions of \nthe Management Board , of which the first three (Mr Dubilet, Mr Novikov and Ms \nGurieva were members)  were ultimately controlled by the Individual Defendants.

The \nBank submitted that I should infer from the fact that none of them were called that they \nwould have confirmed that the Individual Defendants owned and controlled both the \nBank and the Relevant Entities and that they used that control to procure and authorise \nthe making of the Relevant Loans and the Misappropriation more generally.    \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n33 \n 114. The first is Mr Dubilet, the pre -nationalisation chairman of the Bank’s Management \nBoard, whose formal role in approving the Relevant Loans is summarised below .  As \nwill become apparent from a number of parts of this judgment, i t is clear that Mr Dubilet \nhad a central role in the events w ith which these proceedings are concerne d.  \nFurthermore, p re-nationalisation Mr Dubilet had, and continued up to the trial to have, \na close relationship with both of the Individual Defendants, discussing significant \nmatters  with Mr Kolomoisky and being in regular communication with Mr \nBogolyubov.   I make more deta iled findings on these pre -nationalisation relationships \nlater in this judgment.  \n115. These discussions and communications between the Individual Defendants and Mr \nDubilet continued after nationalisation.   Although the surviving documentation is \npatchy, taken in the round it raises a clear inference that Mr Dubilet continued to be \navailable to both of the Individual Defendants for the purposes of giving evidence on \ntheir behalf at the trial and there is no r eason to believe that he would have declined to \ngive evidence on their behalf if either of them had considered it to be in their interes ts \nfor him to do so.  In the following paragraphs, I give some examples from the \ndocuments which have survived as to why I have reached the conclusion that he is likely \nto have remain ed available to them for that purpose.  \n116. On several occasions during the months after nationalisation, when he was replaced as \nchairman of the Management Board by Mr Shlapak, Mr Dubilet sent to Mr Kolomoisky \nconfidential information relating to investigations being carried out post -nationalisation \nin relation to the Bank’s affairs.  This is likely to have been leaked to him by individuals \nloyal to Mr Kolomoisky who wer e still employed by the Bank and extended to material \nrelating to the Bank’s obligation to make disclosures to the Ukrainian prosec uting \nauthorities.  It also extended to communications relating to PwC’s 2015 audit of the \nBank and correspondence about the value of assets which were subject to the Asset \nTransfers.  \n117. Mr Dubilet was also involved in coordinating work for Mr Kolomoisky post -\nnationalisation carried out by individuals who had been employed by the Bank pre-\nnationalisation.  There are a number of examples of this in WhatsApp communications \nboth shortly after nationalisation and much later in 2019, which was well after the time \nat which many of the issues in these proceedings had become apparent.  There is  \nevidence that the closeness of the relationship was active as late as July 2019 when Mr \nDubilet was involved in WhatsApp discussions with Mr Kolomoisky (which seem to \nhave borne fruit), as to how to persuade the Ukrainian police to call in the Bank’s then  \nchairman, Peter Krumphanzl, for questioning about allegations that he had been \ninvolved in a “number of questionable contracts”.  \n118. The closeness of the relationship which Mr Dubilet continued to have with Mr \nKolomoisky after nationalisation was also illustrated by the fact that, in September \n2019, the Individual D efendants  exchanged corresp"}

The closeness of the relationship which Mr Dubilet continued to have with Mr \nKolomoisky after nationalisation was also illustrated by the fact that, in September \n2019, the Individual D efendants  exchanged correspondence about the receipt by Mr \nDubilet of a National Anti -Corruption Bureau summons served in support of a US \ninvestigation into money  laundering by the Individual Defendants.  It is not surprising \nthat a communication of this sort would have been of interest to both of the Individual \nDefendants but , in light of the history, the fact that Mr Kolomoisky had come into \npossession of it and was sharing it with Mr Bogolyubov  demonstrates the continuing \ncloseness of the relationship which Mr Kolomoisky had with Mr Dubilet .  It is also \nclear that the relationship continued on a personal level as well, with examples in the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n34 \n evidence of Mr Dubilet and his family being provided with holidays by Mr \nKolomoisky, both in May 2017, between the time of nationalisation and the \ncommencement of these proceedings, and as late as 2018 and 2019.  \n119. There is no evidence that the relationship between Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Dubilet was \nas close, although Mr Dubilet had an office in the Individual Defendants’ shared offices \nin Geneva, and continued from time to time to work on obtaining and providing Mr \nBogolyubov with information relating to the Bank (such as the Bank’s related party list \nas at 1 December 2016 and a leaked draft of an Ernst & Young  (“EY”)  report) during \nthis period.  There is also clear evidence that, as late as 2019, Mr Dubilet and Mr \nBogolyubov continued to communicate with each other in relation to the Bank’s affairs, \nincluding at least one meeting over lunch which was also attended by Mr Kolomoisky.  \nWhether or not this particular meeting was concerned with the conduct of these \nproceedi ngs (and it is likely that it was, anyway in part), there is no evidence that what \nhad been a close relationship had deteriorated in any way or that Mr Dubilet would not \nbe prepared to cooperate with the wishes of the Individual Defendants in relation to \ntheir defence of these proceedings, including in particular whether or not to give \nevidence on their behalf.  \n120. I have reached the conclusion that, d espite the fact that it is now Mr Bogolyubov’s case \nthat the manner in which the Relevant Loans were granted was “clandestine and \ncontrary to all principles of prudent banking”, and that Mr Dubilet (and other members \nof the Management Board) were responsib le for authorising the steps in the \nMisappropriation without the knowledge, approval and consent of the Individual \nDefendants , it is more likely than not that he would have been available to give evidence \nif asked .  I have been unable to identify any  material evidence that this has caused either \nof the Individual Defendants to distance themselves from Mr Dubilet, who was at the \ncentre of the arrangements by which they were made .  Indeed the contrary is the case , \nbecause the nature and tone of the communications which they had post -nationalisation , \nand such evidence as there is of the ir contact  in that period,  is wholly inconsistent with \nany form of belief by either of the Individual Defendants that the matters of which the \nBank now complains were initiated or implemented by Mr Dubilet and/or other \nmembers of the Management Board without the consent and approval of the Individual \nDefendants.  \n121.

I also accept the Bank’s submission that the case which Mr Bogolyubov now seeks to \nadvance is difficult to reconcile with what he had said in his withdrawn witness \nstatement to the effect that Mr Dubilet was an experienced and talented banker who \ncontinued  to grow and expand the Bank up until the time of nationalisation in 2016.  \nAlthough I would have reached the same conclusion without this evidence, I agree that, \nif the making of the Relevant Loans had not been approved and authorised by the \nIndividual De fendants, the impact which the events surrounding the Misappropriation \nhad on the Bank’s survival and the reasons for its nationalisation means that it is most \nimprobable that the relationship between the three men would have continued as it \nundoubtedly di d. \n122. Mr Dubilet also continued in close contact with a number of other individuals employed \nby the Bank pre -nationalisation, who also featured in the evidence  and who were in \ncontinuing contact with the Individual Defendants post -nationalisation .  These included \nOleg  Gorokhovsky  (a deputy chair of the Management Board from January 2014 until \nnationalisation and head of the Bank’s credit card and salaries department) , Lyudmila \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n35 \n Shmalchenko ( a deputy chair of the Management Board pre -nationalisation and the \nBank’s Director of Treasury ) and Mr Yatsenko , together with other former employees \nof the Bank , including  Vadym Kovalyev who was appointed to the Management Board \nin April 2015.  \n123. In my judgment, Mr Dubilet had highly relevant evidence to give to the claims against \nall of the Defendants and there is every reason to believe that his relationship with all \nof them was such that he would have been prepared to do so if his evidence had assisted \ntheir case.  However, I have reached the conclusion that, if he had been called,  it is \nlikely that  his evidence would have undermined the case of both of the Individual \nDefendants that they did not know of or approve the Relevant Loans or the purpo ses \nfor which they were advanced.  \n124. The second individual who was at the centre of the events with which these proceedings \nare concerned , and was available to give  relevant evidence for the Individual \nDefendants , was Mr Novikov who was also a shareholder in Primecap.  His formal role \nas a member of the Management Board who approved the Relevant Loans is described \nin paragraph 221 below .  As with Mr Dubilet, Mr Novikov’s role in approving the \nRelevant Loans is of itself reason to consider that he had relevant evidence to give both \nby explaining the real purpose for which they were advanced, and by identifying the \nextent to which the Individual Defendants participated in the decisions to make them.  \nBut his participation in events relating to the Misappropriation went well beyond that , \nas to which I make more detailed findings on his pre -nationalisation relationship with \nthe Individual Defendants later in this judgment.  \n125. As to his availability to give evidence at the trial , there is compelling evidence that Mr \nKolomoisky continued to communicate on a regular basis with Mr Novikov after the \nBank’s nationalisation and continued to be in regular contact with him after the \ncommencement of these proceedings.  It appears that Mr Kolomoisky avoided e -mail, \nbut many hundreds of WhatsApp messages  and log records  (together with hundreds of \nattachments) amounting in average to at least two communications per day , were \ndisclosed eviden cing communications made during  the cours"}

It \nis clear from those messages that Mr Kolomoisky  and Mr Novikov had a long -standing \npersonal  relationship , which extended beyond the affairs of the Bank to other aspects \nof Mr Kolomoisky’s business activities  including other business projects , the details of \nwhich were confidential  and of no direct relevance to the issues in these proceedings \nand were therefore r edacted . \n126. As to Mr Novikov’s  post-nationalisation  relationship with Mr Bogolyubov , there is \ndocumentary evidence which establishes that they c ontinued to maintain a personal \nrelationship (and Mr Novikov continued to work for Mr Bogolyubov ) not just in the \nperiod between nationalisation and the commencement of these proceedings, but also \nfor a considerable period thereafter.  Thus in recent years, Mr Novikov has continued \nto exchange hundreds of WhatsApp messages with Mr Bogolyubov relating  to his \nUkrainian and other assets and has been assisting Mr Bogolyubov with the conduct of \nhis def ence to these proceedings.  There is also evidence from WhatsApp exchanges \nthat Mr Novikov continued to be in communication with Vyach eslav Anischenko  \nsubsequent to the Bank’s nationalisation.  Mr Anischenko  had originally worked for the \nBank between 2000 and 2008 when he became Mr Bogolyubov’s  personal assistant \ninvolved in the administration of some of his personal investments.   Like Mr Dubilet , \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n36 \n he too was  present in the Geneva office shared by the Individual Defendants and seems \nto have had his own office in the premises at least between the time of nationalisation \nand the middle of 2020.  \n127. In all the circumstances, I have concluded  that Mr Novikov would have been able to \ngive relevant evidence which would have cast light on the purpose of the Relevant \nLoans and the Individual Defendants’ knowledge of , and participation in , the \nMisappropriation if either of the Individual Defendants had chosen to call him.  \nFurthermore, his relationship with both of the Individual Defendants was such that it is \nto be expected that he would have been called if the Individual Defendants did no t have \ncountervaili ng reasons for not doing so.  There is no evidence that, despite his direct \ninvolvement in many of the issues which have arisen in these proceedings, he was \nunavailable to be called by either of the Individual Defendants to give evidence on their \nbehalf.  In my judgment, if he had been called, it is likely that his evidence would have \nundermined the case of both of the Individual Defendants that they did not know of , or \nparticipate in , the Relevant Loans or the purposes for which they were advanced.  \n128. The Bank also submitted in its oral closing argument that Mr Anischenko could have \nbeen cal led to give evidence, not least because his willingness to do so on behalf of Mr \nBogolyubov was apparent from what occurred in proceedings brought against both of \nthe Individual Defendants by Vadim Shulman in May 2017 (the “Shulman \nProceedings”).   In particula r, it was said with some force that , if there had been \nsubstance in Mr Bogolyubov’s allegation that he had made an oral agreement with Mr \nKolomoisky in early Jul y 2014 to step away from the Bank, it is very likely that Mr \nAnischenko would have known about it and been ab"}

I infer that one of the reasons he was not called was that , \nas Mr Bogolyubov’s per sonal assistant,  his evidence might have undermined Mr \nBogolyubov’s pleade d case on the  oral agreement which is said to have been formalised \nin the  Deeds of Waiver and Indemnity ; an issue to which I shall revert later in the \njudgment.  \n129. The third individual who was at the centre of the events with which these proceedings \nare concerned and could have given relevant evidence for the Individual Defendants is \nMs Gurieva.  Her formal role as a member of the Management Board and her \nparticipati on in the approval of the Relevant Loans is described below .  A spreadsheet, \ndescribed during the course of the trial as the “Gurieva Spreadsheet”, which (amongst \nother things) identifies  the Unreturned Prepayments and links each of the original 46 \nBorrowe rs’ indebtedness to the Bank to an Unreturned Prepayment, was found on her \nlaptop.  \n130. Of equal  significance for present purposes is Ms Gurieva’s post -nationalisation  contact \nwith the Individual Defendants , which clearly demonstrated her  preparedness to assist \nthe Defendants in their defence to these proceedings .  She headed a team  of former \nemployees of the Bank and Primecap who produced what ha ve come to be called the \nLafferty Spreadsheets  (named after the partner in Field fisher to whose interlocutory \nevidence they were exhibited ). \n131. It is convenient to give a  brief explanation of the Lafferty Spreadsheets and the  work \ninvolved in their preparation at this stage .  The work was carried out from the Geneva \noffices of the Individual Defendants  in early 2018 (i.e. very shortly after the original \ngrant of the WFO), at a time when both Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov  were \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n37 \n living in Geneva.  The Lafferty Spreadsheets were at the centre of the case presented \nby the Individual Defendants on their jurisdiction challenge s and were described as the \noutput of a tracing exercise, which was said to explain the true nature of what was called \nthe scheme alleged against them.  Although Mr Kolomoisky made the running on the \njurisdiction challenge, Mr Bogolyubov said in evidence that he made his jurisdiction \nchallenge on the same grounds as Mr Kolomoisky and referred to and relied on Mr \nLafferty’s evidence in support, including therefore the Lafferty Spreadsheets.  \n132. The exercise of their production involved an analysis of the bank statements of 214 \nseparate companies (the “Lafferty Spreadsheets Companies”) through whose hands \nmonies drawn down by the Borrowers were said to have passed.  They include all but \none of the Borrowers and 13 of the Intermediary Borrowers.  As the evidence then \nadduced made clear, they were put together by teams of people including former \nemployees of the Bank, who were said to have been aware of both the transaction \npatterns described and the  companies involved in the scheme, and that they had done \nso based on their understanding of the way in which that scheme had operated.  \n133. The Lafferty Spreadsheets consist ed of appro ximately  6,000 rows of data setting out \ndetails of 926 payment chains , which were  said to show the operation of a scheme  by \nwhich money cycled through loops , with mon ey moving through the Bank’s branches \nin Ukraine, Cyprus and Latvia,  which w"}

It was said that , subject to very \nlimited exceptions, they demons trated that all the money borrowed by the  original  46 \nBorrowers , and  which  passed through the  hands of the  Corporate Defendants , was \nultimately repaid to the Bank  in discharge of some other liability to it.   These payme nt \nchains  included what was described as a break point  / compensation structure,  by which \nit was meant that there was a gap in the chain between origin and destination, such that \nit was not immediately apparent how the chain connects, and the fi nal money repaid to \nthe Bank appears to originate from somewhere else.   Those who prepared them \nadvanced a case that at least US$452 million of Relevant Drawdowns went via break \npoints to repay loans of companies in which the Individual Defendants ha d admitted \ninterests.  \n134. Although they were at the centre of the Individual Defendants’ case for several years,  \nthe Bank’s expert evidence was that they did not follow, or even purport to follow, a \nconsistent methodology or approach  and contain ed significant inaccuracies , \ninconsistencies  and omissions .  In the event , neither of the experts appointed by the \nIndividual Defendants to give evidence on their behalf at the trial was able to  support \nthe analysis contained in the Lafferty Spreadsheets  and they were abandoned in March \n2022 shortly before the trial was originally due to start.   Having done so,  Mr \nKolomoisky’s case in relation to the scheme described in Mr Lafferty’s evidence and \nthe Lafferty Spreadsheets was then expressed as follows:  \n“The term “Scheme” used in Mr Lafferty’s Second Witness Statement was defined \nin paragraph 13 as follows “the scheme identified by the Bank … which it wrongly \ncontends gives it a cause of action (“the Scheme”)”. The Scheme identified by the \nBank was illustrated in a series of Charts referred to as the “i2 Charts” which \nthemselves identified a large number of companies alleged to be involved in a \nScheme to defraud the Bank and purported to map payments made by one to the \nother by reference to transactions.  The Lafferty Spreadsheets attempted to trace the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n38 \n actual flow of funds from one bank account to another. The First Defendant no \nlonger places any reliance on the Lafferty  Spreadsheets.  In none of his statements \nof case, nor in his evidence for trial does the First Defendant describe the features \nof, or advance any positive case of, the existence of any scheme. However, the \nLafferty Spreadsheets and the tracing exercise con ducted by Mr Davidson  (the \nforensic accounti ng expert instr ucted by Mr Kolomoisky ) demonstrate that a \nsubstantial part of the funds adv anced by the Bank under the Relevant Loans came \nback to the Bank to repay other loans that would not otherwise have been repaid.  \nIf and insofar as that analysis identifies a “Scheme”, it was not a scheme to defraud \nthe Bank. ” \n135. The Bank submitted in its opening submissions at the trial that this was a remarkable \ndevelopment given the  Lafferty Spreadsheets were said to have been compiled  by the \nteam who were “aware of the transaction patterns described…and the companies \ninvolved in the scheme” and had by the  time "}

The Lafferty Spreadsheets had been  referred to at some length in the judgment of the \nCourt of Appeal  on the Defendants’ jurisdiction challenge s (see in particular [2019] \nEWCA Civ 1708 , [2020] Ch 783 at [243] and [244]), which concluded that there was \nreason to believe that the exercise of preparing the Lafferty Spreadsheets “ was \nundertaken by individuals who were themselves involved in the alleged fraud ”, and \nrequired to be approached with caution .  In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, \nthe docume ntation and circumstances surrounding the Lafferty Spreadsheets and their \npreparation  demonstrated with clarity that the Relevant Drawdowns were part of what \nthe Bank’s forensic accounting expert accurately characterised as a money  laundering \nexercise, which had no genuine or legitimate commercial purpose.  \n137. The Lafferty Spreadsheet s Companies included all of the Borrowers,  14 of the \nIntermediary Borrowers, all six of the Corporate Defendants  and more than 50 of the \ncompanies disclosed by the Individual Defendants as amongst their assets pursuant to \ntheir disclosure obligations under the WFO.   The Lafferty Spreadsheets themselves  \nwere presented on the basis that they had been produced using the Bank’s transactional \ndata provided by former employees and clients of the Bank.  When the Bank indicated \nthat the provision of this data was likely to constitute a criminal offence under Ukrainian \nlaw, Mr Kolomoisky changed his position and asserted instead that the Lafferty \nSpreadsheets had been produced using  the bank statements  of the Lafferty Spreadsheet s \nCompanies , copies of which seem to have been available to Mr Kolomoisky  on request . \n138. This is one of the several elements of the evidence which has caused me to conclude \nthat the Borrowers,  the Intermediary Borrowers and  the Corporate Defendants were all \nultimately owned and controlled by one or both of the Individual Defendants.   I should \nmake clear at this stage, that when I use the word  “own” in this context I mean  the \nownership of  a beneficial interest in the  entity concerned  sufficient to control its affairs \nand when I use the word  “control” , the concept which I seek to capture is the a bility by \nwhatever means to procure the relevant entity to act (or not act) in accordance with the \ncontroller ’s wishes  and instructions , either  generally or unconditionally in the relevant \ncontext.  \n139. The Bank contends that, in the light of Ms Gurieva’s involvement in this exercise, she \nwould have been able to give evidence of what had originally been relied on both by \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n39 \n Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov as particulars of the mechanisms by which the \nsums returned to the Bank as part of the loan recycling scheme were said by them to \nhave amounted to repayments of the Relevant Loans.  I agree that it is highly likely \nthat, as head of BOK and leader of the team which put together the Lafferty \nSpreadsheets, Ms Gurieva would have had valuable evidence to give on the purpose \nbehind the transactions recorded in them and the extent to which either or both of the \nIndividual Defendants  had been aware of and participated in what had occurred.  \n140.

I agree that it is highly likely \nthat, as head of BOK and leader of the team which put together the Lafferty \nSpreadsheets, Ms Gurieva would have had valuable evidence to give on the purpose \nbehind the transactions recorded in them and the extent to which either or both of the \nIndividual Defendants  had been aware of and participated in what had occurred.  \n140. Having provided this assistance to the Defendants in their defence of these proceedings, \nthere is no suggestion and no evidence that her relationship with them deteriorated \nthereafter or that she had otherwise become unavailable to give evidence on their b ehalf.  \nIndeed there is evidence that she continued to be in touch with Mr Kolomoisky \nthroughout the period up to the end of 2019.  There is no evidence that she was \nunavailable to be called by either of the Individual Defendants and it is likely that, if \nshe had been called, her evidence would have undermined the case of both of the \nIndividual Defendants that they did not know of or participate in the Relevant Loans or \nthe purposes for which they were advanced.  \n141. The fourth  individual , who was at the centre of the events with which these proceedings \nare concerned , and who is said by the Bank to have been available to give r elevant \nevidence , is Mr Melnyk.  He was head of PBC,  an entity the significance of which I \nshall explain a little later in this judgment  and was employed by Sunaltezza Consulting \nLtd (“Sunaltezza”) between November 2017 and January 2020.  Sunaltezza was a \ncompany owned and controlled by Mr Bogolyubov.  Mr Melnyk  acted as a nominee for \nboth of the Individual Defendants in respect of a number of their valuable assets, \nsometimes pursuant to oral agreements: Mr Kolomoisky disclosed seven oral \nagreements and Mr Bogolyubov disclosed five oral agreements to which Mr Melnyk \nwas party.  He was also a purpor ted ultimate beneficial owner (“UBO”) of 27 Borrowers \nand twelve Intermediary Borrowers and was recorded as having a beneficial ownership \nin the English Defendants.  \n142. Mr Melnyk also had a role in a number of events which related to the making of the \nRelevant Loans and the Misappropriation  more generally .  His participation included \nprocuring the execution by nominees of contracts to which the Corporate Defendants \nwere party, corresponding on and seeking loans in respect of the payment of fees \nrelating to the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings and liai sing with BOK in relation to aspects \nof the Asset Transfers in July 2016 (viz. the valuation of some of the petrol stations \nwhich appeared on a document called the Topch y spreadsheet which I will refer to later \nin this judgment).  \n143. However, I was not shown any substantial evidence that Mr Melnyk was still in touch \nwith Mr Kolomoisky after nationalisation .  That is not to say that there was any \nevidence that he was not , and there was evidence that he had been in contact with Mr \nBogolyubov as late as 2021 .  Furthermore,  his employment by Sun altezza until January \n2020 demonstrates that he was available to assist Mr Bogolyubov  in the defence of \nthese proceedings up at least until then.  There is no evidence that he did not continue \nto be available and there is no reason to believe that if he had been asked to give \nevidence on behalf of Mr Bogolyubov (and probably Mr Kolomoisky as well) he would \nhave done so.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n40 \n 144.

She was an employee of the Bank’s Cypr us branch , who transferred \nto Primecap  two days after nationalisation .  She was involved in the administration of \nthe Individual Defendants’ assets and was a party to WhatsApp exchanges which were \ndisclosed very late in the preparation of the case for tr ial and which, on the Bank’s case, \nrevealed the extent of Mr Bogolyubov’s active continued involvement  with the Bank \nlong after the time at which he said that he had taken a back seat in its affairs.   In \nparticular, her evidence would have related to (a) the circumstances surrounding the \nmovement of former Bank employees to  Primecap at the time of the Bank’s \nnationalisation , and (b) correspondence in 2019 relating to the BVI Defendan ts, which \nmade clear  that their continued funding was being  provided by two other entities \n(Sanderlyn Limited  (“Sanderlyn”)  and Versala  Limited  (“Versala”) ) whose sole \nshareholders were Cy priot residents accustomed to acting as nominees for b oth of the \nIndividual Defendants.  This is what the Bank called compelling evidence of the \nIndividual Defendants’ o wnership and /or control of Prim ecap and the Bank’s case as \nto their  ownership and control of the Relevant Entities . \n145. I shall come back to this aspect of the case later, but for present purposes, I am satisfied \nthat Ms Markova was available to give evidence on behalf of the Individual Defendants \nhad they chosen to call her.  Her availability was confirmed by the fact that, having \ntransferred to Cyprus immediately after nation alisation, she was one of a number of \nformer Bank employees who continued to receive payments for services from entities \ncontrolled by the Individual Defendants, including in particular S unalt ezza by w hom it \nappears that she was then employed.   I shall revert to Sunaltezza shortly, but the Bank \nrelied heavily on the fact that the role of Sunaltezza as a custodian of documents in the \ncontrol of Mr Bogolyubov only fully emerged in the course of late disclosure given \nduring the course of the trial . \n \nThe documentary evidence  \n146. Although the court was faced with a vast amount of documentation, it is clear that \nrelevant documents which may have been available in the past are now no longer \navailable, and that many of the events which occurred were either never evidenced by \ndisclosab le documents or were evidenced in a form which has not survived.  There are \na number of aspects to this, all leading to the Bank making two overarching \nsubmission s.  The first is that the court should draw adverse inferences against the \nIndividual Defendan ts for their serious and culpable failure to give proper disclosure.  \nThe second is that their practised failure to create and retain relevant documentation \nmeans that the absence of documents giving direct support for the Bank’s allegations \nagainst the In dividual Defendants (and more particularly Mr Bogolyubov) does not \ndetract from the Bank’s case that it is most improbable that they did not know about \nand were not involved in the loan recycling or the Misappropriation.  \n147. It is the Bank’s case that one of the principal reasons that the documentary record is \nincomplete is that the Individual Defendants have, throughout these proceedings, failed \nto make proper disclosure in accordance with their obligations.  These obligation s \nincluded making search -based Model E disclosure in relation to the allegations of \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n41 \n ownership and /or control of the Borrowers, the Intermediary Borrowers, the Share \nPledg"}

When dealing with the position of Mr Kolomoisky, the way in which Mr \nRobert Anderson KC for the Ba nk put the point in his oral submissions was that he had \nadopted a deliberate strategy to ensure that relevant documents have never seen the light \nof day.  \n148. Based on the way in which they complied with their disclosure obligations, it appeared \nthat one of the differences between Mr Kolomoisky’s and Mr Bogolyubov’s working \npractices was that Mr Bogolyubov was accustomed to using e -mail: he had a Gmail \naccount f rom which a limited number of e -mails were eventually produced.  Mr \nKolomoisky took a different approach.  He had a general practice of deliberately \navoiding the use of documentation relating to the conduct of his business affairs.  \nIndeed , he said in his own disclosure certificate that, be cause he has been targeted by \nbusiness and political rivals in Ukraine and by the Russian state and President Putin, he \nhas for many years  “sought to limit the risk of inadvertent and /or malicious disclosure \nof business or politically sensitive information  by consciously and actively restricting \nthe volume of documents he has created and handled, and by choosing to avoid the use \nof e-mail”.  This avoidance of the use of e -mail was reiterat ed in another statement in \nhis dis closure certificate that he “does not use (and has never used ) a personal e -mail \naccount, whether for personal or business purposes.   He does not consider e-mail to be \na safe and reliable method of communication .” \n149. The Bank does not submit that what Mr Kolomoisky had to say about not using e -mail \nis wrong or untrue.  However, it is able to point to this explanation as supportive of its \nsubmission that the absence of e -mails giving direct support for the Bank’s allega tions \nagainst Mr Kolomoisky does not detract from its case that he knew about and \nparticipated in the loan recycling or the Misappropriation.  \n150. The absence of other relevant documentation is said to be more telling.  Thus, the Bank \nsubmit ted that it is inherently incredible that neither Mr Kolomoisky nor his secretaries \nretained any records which kept track of where he was supposed to be, when he was \nsupposed to be there and who he was meeting in relation to events which were relevant \nto issu es in these proceedings.   In my judgment, there is real force in this submis sion.  \n151. The only records of any significance came from WhatsApp exchanges.  These were the \nonly records of the principal means by which the Individual Defendants communicated \nwith each other and the remainder of their inner circle, viz. WhatsApp, Viber, mobile \ntelephone or the use of the ‘Black’ , a secure telephone network by which several dozen \nindividuals who featured in the evidence at trial were able to communicate with each \nother by calling numbers recorded by their name in a directory.   Amongst those records \nare examples (mostly at the time of and after nationalisation) of WhatsApp messages \nbetween the Individual Defendants which recorded nothing of substance, because they \ndid no more than request one or other of them to speak on the Bl ack. \n152. Although Mr Kolomoisky has given some disclosure of messages from the period \nbetween 2015 and 2016, increasing substantially from 2017 onwards, he has disclosed \nno messages in the period 2013 and 2014 when the Misappropriation was taking place."}

However, even during 2017 (in particular immediately prior to the \ncommencement of these proceedings in December 2017), it is possible to see from a \ncomparison of the WhatsApp messages disclosed by Mr Bogolyubov and those \ndisclosed by Mr Kolomois ky that in this period at least, there were communications \nbetween the two of them , of which Mr Bogolyubov had retained a record while Mr \nKolomoisky had not.  \n153. Mr Anderson said that both Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov also had a “burn after \nreading” policy.  This allegation concentrated on documentation  destruction, as \nopposed to documents not coming into existence in the first place, and I am satisfied \nthat th is undoubtedly happened in many instances.  A stark illustration of this was a \nfurther admission  by Mr Kolomoisky in his disclosure certificate  that his “general \npracti ce has been not to retain hard copy documents ”.  He went on to say that, a fter \nreviewing  a hard copy document,  his “practice has been to dispose of the document \nimmediately or once any action points have been completed”.   The Bank criticised  this \nas an extraordinary way for a supervisory board member of a major financial institution \nwith c.20 million customers to behave.  Notwithstanding the Ukrainian context to which \nI have already referred, I agree ; it gives some small insight into some of the unusual \naspects of the Bank’s pre -nationalisation culture . \n154. Nonetheless, o n one view Mr Kolomoisky’s general practice might be said to support \nan argument that the manner in which he was accustomed to operate provides an \nexplanation for the absence of relevant documentation available for inspection by the \nBank, which cannot of i tself be regarded as nefarious, anyway so far as these \nproceedings are concerned.  If that is what he always did, so the argument goes, there \nis no reason to consider that his deliberate document destruction policy should cause \nthe court to d raw adverse inferences in the context of these proceedings.  \n155. However, I do not think that this would be the right conclusion to draw.  One \noverarching reason for this is the striking fact that Mr Kolomoisky disclosed no \ndocumentary communications between himself and any third party in the period prior \nto May 2015.  Taken alone, that is capable of having an innocent explanation, but is \ncast in a rather different light by the fact that he started his disclosure by declining to \naccept his obligation to disclose relevant documents which it is now clear were within \nhis co ntrol, being in the possession of entities which it has subsequently become \napparent were either vehicles controlled by him or vehicles which held documents as \ncustodians on his behalf.  There were many other occasions during the course of the \ncase’s prepa ration for trial on which the court had cause to criticise Mr Kolomoisky’s \napproach to disclosure.

Overall I accept the Bank’s submission that, even in a case of \nthis size and complexity, the Bank should not have been required to make so many \nsuccessful d isclosure applications, with conspicuous examples relating to documents \nwithin his control which emanated from Primecap and the initial failure to identify PBC \nas a corporate services provider holding relevant documents which were in fact within \nhis contro l. \n156. The Bank made detailed submissions relying on the procedural history of the \ndifficulties it had in obtaining disclosure of the Primecap documentation.  There is no \nneed for me to recite them in this judgment but what occurred was reflected in a number \nof disclosure orders the court was required to make during the course of the pre paration \nof the case for trial.  Taken in the round I think it is fair to summarise Mr Kolomoisky’ s \nattitude to the Bank’s efforts to obtain that documentation and the compliance b y him \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n43 \n with his duties to make proper disclosure as being that “he would delay and obfuscate \nfor as long as possible in the hope that these documents would not come out ”.  But I \nthink that what occurred also betrayed a mindset which sought to make the disclosure \nprocess as painful as possible for the Bank, while drip -feeding material to give the \nimpression that he was complying with his obligations.   I have no confidence that the \nBank has seen all of the surviving documentation in Mr Kolomoisky’s control which \nrelate to the issues for disclosure in these proceedings . \n157. If anything the position was more stark in relation to PBC , which was not initially \nidentified as a potential custodian of relevant documentation .  In the light of what has \nnow transpired, it was obvious that documentation in its possession was in Mr \nKolomoisky’s control and should have been searched and disclosed to the Bank from \nan early stage in the disclosure process .  Mr Kolomoisky must have know n that this \nwas the case  if only because 23 PBC employees were said to hold assets for him \npursuant to 97 or al agreements.   It then eventually transpired that PBC’s mail server no \nlonger exists , with the consequence that it was no longer possible to access what was \nlikely to have be en one of the more important potential sources of documentation \nrelevant to these proceedings : the e -mails of Mr Melnyk.  \n158. I have also concluded that Mr Kolomoisky took deliberate decisions to procure the \ndestruction of data which was capable of being relevant to the current proceedings, in \ncircumstances which had nothing to do with a well -established or commercially \njustifiab le practice of document destruction for the types of reason identified by him.  \nA summary explanation of why I am satisfied that was the case is appropriate, although \nit is fair to say that the essence of those circumstances w as disclosed in Mr \nKolomoisky’ s own disclosure certificate.  \n159. Over an extended period commencing in 2009 and including the period of the \nMisappropriation, the nationalisation of the Bank and up to the commencement of these \nproceedings, the Individual Defendants were parties to several sets of legal proceedings \nin bot h this jurisdiction and the US in relation to what the Bank called aspects of their \nbusiness empire.   They included English proceedings brought against the Individual \nDefendants by Victor Pinchuk in 2013 (the “Pinchuk Proceedings”) , proceedings \nbrought in England against both of the Individual Defendants by PJSC Tatneft in March \n2016 (the “Tatneft Proceedings”)  and the Shulman Proceedings .

They were both also \nat the centre of English proceedings brought by Eclairs Group Ltd (which they \ncontrolled through a series of trusts) and Glengarry Overseas Limited against JKX Oil \n& Gas Plc in June 2013.  \n160. There was no suggestion that these other proceedings related to the same matters as \nhave been in issue in this claim, but there was a material overlap on some of the issues \nwhich were at the heart of the current dispute, including the manner in which both of \nthe Individual Defendants were accustomed to conduct their businesses and the \nrelationships th ey had with individuals and entities who have featured in the present \nproceedings.  These included the relationship which the Individual Defendants had \nbetween  themselves and the relationship which Mr Kolomoisky had with Mr Novikov .  \nThey also included  the manner in which  Mr Bogolyubov used his personal assistant, \nMr Anischenko , as a conduit for communicating with ot hers in relation to his affairs .  \nThese matters  are c entra l to an understanding of the probabilities that the Individual \nDefendants approved of and procured the Misappropriation.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n44 \n 161. The existence of these proceedings meant that, with the possible exception of a single \nperiod between the ending of the Pinchuk Proceedings in January 2016 and the \ncommencement of the Tatneft Proceedings in March 2016, both of the Individual \nDefendants wer e subject to clear document preservation obligations pursuant to \nPD57AD and its predecessors (including at the most relevant times paragraph 7 of \nPD31B).  That obligation extended to any time they knew that they may become party \nto proceedings.  In these c ircumstances, it is very surprising that, during that short three -\nmonth period, Mr Kolomoisky gave instructions to his disclosure provider in the \nPinchuk Proceedings ( AlixPartners (“Alix”) ) to destroy the data they had imaged for \nthe purposes of those proceedings from a mobile phone, which was not itself retained \nafter the imaging had taken place.  \n162. So far as Mr Bogolyubov is concerned, the issue was more about compliance with his \nobligations than a stark example of document destruction , although like Mr \nKolomoisky he had surprising difficulty in obtaining documentation from those who \nworked with and for him .  I also think there are some indications that, although he stood \nbehind Mr Kolomoisky in relation to the very slow pace and incomplete manner in \nwhich the Primecap and PBC  documentation  emerged , he was complicit in the approach \nthat Mr Kolomoisky adopted.  This was reflected by the fact that it is now clear that \nthere are  21 PBC n ominees holding  79 assets for him pursuant to some form of \nundocumented arrangement.  \n163. The Bank made detailed submission s about the unsatisfactory manner in which \ndisclosure  in relation to  Mr Bogolyubov’s e -mail accounts occurred.  This required a \nnumber of court orders during the course of preparing the case for trial .  There were a \nnumber of aspects to this.  They included the fact that no e -mails were disclosed from \none of his accounts in relation to the period prior to 25 February 2016 , even though it \nis clear that the account had been in use during th at period .

Taken overall, I \nam not satisfied from what I have seen that there has be en an explanation f or all of the \napparent gaps in what has been disclosed.  Whether or not the material  still exists, I \nhave little doubt that the disclosed documentary record  of Mr Bogolyubov’s \ninvolvement in matters relating to the issue s in these proceedings falls very far short of \nwhat was in existence at the time the events occurred.  \n164. The Bank places particular reliance on the fact that it was only by chance (and well \nafter the date on which the trial was due to commence) that significant and highly \nrelevant documentation came to light in the form of material in the possession of two \ncompanies wholly owned by Mr Bogolyubov: Grizal Enterprises Ltd (“Grizal”) and \nSunaltezza , but which had not previously been identified by Mr Bogolyubov as a \ndocument custodian .  In order to understand the significance of what occurred, it is \nnecessary to re iterate that it has always been at the heart of the Bank’s case that the \nBorrowers and the Intermediary Borrowers (together with Primecap and PBC) were \ncompanies in the ultimate beneficial ownership of both of the Individual Defendants.  \nThis was always de nied by the Defendants and, during the course of the preparation of \nthe case for trial, it was one of the most contentious aspects of the dispute.  It was a \ncentral  part of the Bank’s case, because, if established, it gave material weight to its \nallegation s both that the Individual Defendants must have know n of and given \ninstructions in relation to the Misappropriation and that they were likely to have \nbenefi tted from it in some way.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n45 \n 165. The starting point for explaining what occurred is that neither Grizal nor Sunaltezza \nwas identified during the course of Mr Bogolyubov’s disclosure as a potential custodian \nof the documents he was  required to disclose pursuant to the orders for extended \ndisclosure which had been made earlier in the proceedings.  As a result of an \ninterlocutory application to enforce the WFO in a number of other jurisdictions, \ntogether with certain ancillary relief,  the Bank started to probe for additional \ndocumentation rel ating to the source of Mr Bogolyubov’s income.  This eventually led \nto the disclosure after the commencement of the trial of bank statements from Grizal \nand then Sunaltezza which themselves demonstrated that both entities had  since 1 \nNovember 2017  been making substantial payments to ten individuals , including Mr \nMelnyk,  (together with  a further eleventh employee , Konstia ntyn Ivlev , with effect \nfrom 6 March 201 9) who had been employed by PBC . \n166. These individuals  were recorded elsewhere in the trial papers as having associated role s \neither on the basis that they were one of the ultimate beneficial owners (“ UBOs ”) of the \nEnglish Defendants  (as claimed by the Corporate Defendants ), or one of the ED \nPrincipals  or one or more of 34 of the  Borrowers or one or more of  23 of the \nIntermediary Borrowers .  Many of them had also acted as nominees for the Individual \nDefendants  in relation to other assets in which either or both of the Individual \nDefendants  held an undisputed beneficial interest .  I was taken to the employment \ncontract which Mr Melnyk  (who had been head of PBC) had with Sunaltezza ; he was \ncontracted to work 50 hours per week at a salary of EUR 7,500 per mo nth. \n167.

This very late disclosure therefore made clear that Mr Bogolyubov’s companies were  \nmaking monthly payments to the very same former PBC employees who the Bank says , \nbut Mr Bogolyubov denies , held interests in various of the Borrowers and  Intermediary \nBorrowers for him and Mr Kolomoisky .  They also show that Mr Bogolyubov’s \ncompanies employed three of the five purported UBOs of the English Defendants (Mr \nMelnyk  and Anna  Yesipova from 1 November 2017 , and Mr Ivlev  from March 201 9) \nand one of the ED Principals (Olena Ryazantseva) .  The Bank submitted that  this was \npowerful evidence that the Individual Defendants we re the true beneficial owners of \nthe Borrowers , the Intermediary Borrowers and indeed PBC and that this \ndocumentation should have been disclosed much earlier in the proceedings .  Indeed, in  \nthe case of Mr Melnyk, the link to Mr Bogolyubov through Sunaltezza had been \ndeliberately obscured by his assertion on a contested disclosure application made in \nNovember 2022 that he had no right to search the devices, accounts and telephones of \nMr Melnyk (amongst others).  I n that context  it was misleading not to mention that this \nwas probably wrong because he was for much of the period to which the application \nrelated an employee of Mr Bogolyubov’s own service company . \n168. The essence of Mr Bogolyubov ’s submission s was that the whole issue had been blown \nout of all proportion and  that it certainly does not show that documents have been \ndeliberately withheld.  It was said that , promptly upon becoming aware that Grizal and \nSunaltezza  might hold relevant documents, Mr Bogolyubov took steps to collect and \nreview them  and that any defects in the original disclosure process ha ve now been \nremedied .  The substance of what this late disclosure showed was dealt with in a letter \nfrom Mr Bogolyubov’s solicitors  sent shortly before the trial resumed after the long \nvacation.  They said:  \n“We are instructed that in or about late 2016/early 2017 our client was informed \nthat it would help to  facilitate the granting of visas to certain individuals intending \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n46 \n to relocate to Cyprus if those individuals  were employed by a company which had \na trading history of more than two years in Cyprus. Mr Bogolyubov had such a \ncompany and was therefore approached for assistance.  \nMr Bogolyubov was informed that certain of the individuals provided corporate \nservices to various companies in which he had an interest and would do so through \nSunaltezza while it employed them.  He acquiesced to the request on the \nunderstanding that the employment arrangements would be temporary and that the \ncost of the employment would be set off against service charges that such \nindividuals would otherwise have charged Mr Bogolyubov’s companies.  This \narrangement was not recorded in writing. Mr Bogolyubov  did not enquire about the \nspecific identities of the individuals.  Mr Bogolyubov has not seen the employment \ncontracts between Sunaltezza and these individuals and is not personally involved \nin the payroll process or any administrative aspects of Sunaltezza.  \nFor a short period of time in late  2017/early 2018, Sunaltezza did not have \nsufficient funds to pay the salaries of the employees in question.

The fact that he agreed that these companies  should make these payments  \nin the first place , and the manner in which the individual s concerned received the \npayments  under contracts of employment entered into with Mr Bogolyubov’s own \nservice companies, is a very clear confirmation of the pervading  interconnectivity \n(through these individuals) between the Borrowers, the Intermediary Borrowers, the \nCorporate Defendants  and Mr Bogolyubov.  This is all the more striking in \ncircumstances in which it is at the heart of Mr Bogolyubov ’s case that he had stepped \naway from the Bank as a result of an agreement he reached with Mr Kolomoisky in  July \n2014 , said to have been formalised by the execution of the Deed s of Waiver  and \nIndemnity  in May and June 2015.  \n170. It is also of central relevance that the PBC nominees included three of the five purported \nUBOs of the English Defendants, who , as I shall explain later , were said to have be en \nresponsible for funding their defence of these proceedings. The employment status they \ncan now be seen to have had within Sunaltezza means that th e suggestion that they were \nresponsible for funding any of the Corporate Defendants’ defences lacks all credibility.  \nIt is very much more likely that the funding came from those behind  Sunaltezza, who \nalso had an interest in the outcome of the proceedings, i.e., Mr Bogolyubov and possibly \nMr Kolomoisky as well.  \n171. Two other aspects of the manner in which this information emerged very late in the day \ncaused me real concern, and cast significant doubt on the court’s ability to place reliance \non unevidenced assertions from Mr Bogolyubov about his continuing invol vement with \nthe various corporate entities wh ich participated in the Misappropriation .  They also \nmade me sceptical that the court can assume that full disclosure has been given by Mr \nBogolyubov and corporate custodians of documents held on his behalf in relation to the \nimportant  matter of his continuing role in the affairs of the Bank, and the other corporate \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n47 \n entities involved in the Misappr opriation both up to and after July 2014.   The fact that \nMr Bogolyubov has chosen not to give  evidence in support of this or any other aspect \nof his defence  supports a conclusion  that I cannot proceed on the basis that full \ndisclosure on these issues has been given .  I cannot speculate on what remains \nundisclosed , but nor do I consider it remotely arguable that the absence of further  \ndocumentation regarding Mr Bogolyubov’s relationship with the Borrowers, the \nIntermediary Bor rowers and the Corporate Defendants carries any real weight  to prove \nthat part of his case which specifically denied that Mr Bogolyubov controlled the \nBorrowers or the Intermediary Borrowers via PBC or at all.    \n172. The first is  that, at an earlier stage in the proceedings  (January 2022) , the Bank had  \npleaded  the Individual Defendants ’ ownership and control of PBC in support of its \nallegation that they owned and /or controlled the Borrowers and the Intermediary \nBorrowers.

It scheduled to its pleading a list of individuals who were said to have been \nofficers , directors, representatives,  shareholders and/or purported UBOs of the \nUkrainian Borrowers and at least 29 of the Intermediary Borrowers .  Mr Bogolyubov ’s \nresponse was that he  was not acquainted with any of the individuals identified in the \nschedule  (save for Mr Melnyk, who is admitte d to have been an officer or employee of \nPBC) and did not know whether any of those individuals were employees or officers of \nPBC.   This turned out to be a very misleading response, given that it is now clear that \nnine of th ose were employed through his own wholly owned service company in the \nperiod after nationalisation.   No properly evidence d explanation for this inexplicable \ndiscrepancy was ever given.  \n173. The second relates to Ms Markova.  She had moved from the Bank’s Cypriot branch to \nPrimecap at the time of nationalisation .  After the commencement of the proceedings \nshe was sending regular messages to Mr Kolomoisky about the bank balance s of the \ntwo entities (Sanderly n and Versala) which were being used to fund the BVI \nDefendants’ defence of these proceedings .  This was a state of affairs from which Mr \nBogolyubov sought to distance himself and in respect of which he said in opening that \n“the Bank again seeks to elide the positions of Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Kolomoisky ”.  \nOn 26 January 2023, I made an orde r requir ing both of the Individual Defendants to \ncontact Ms Markova to assist with the provision of information necessary for the Bank \nto police the WFO .  Mr Bogolyubov’s response was that he had contacted Ms Markova \nbut th at he had not , as at 28 February  2023 , received a response.  \n174. I agree with the Bank that Mr Bogolyubov’s response  is not credible .  Ms Markova was \nthen an employee of Mr Bogolyubov’s service company, Sunaltezza , and was at that \nvery period of time receiving regular payments from Sunaltezza in payment of her \nsalary, bonus and expenses.   Furth ermore , two other employees of Sunaltezza  \n(Vict oriya Pyrog and Valeria Diachenko) were the authorised  users on Sanderlyn’s \nintern et bank account , which ties Mr Bogolyubov in more closely to control of the \nCorporate Defendants.  In my view, this  demonstrates that the submission that the Bank \nwas illegitimately seeking to elide the positions of Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Kolomoisky \nwas ill -founded.  \n175. In my judgment the Bank was entitled to ask: why, if it was true that Mr Bogolyubov \nhad indeed tried to step away from the Bank in July 2014, did he employ a string of \nformer Cyprus branch employees in the year following nationalisation and why did he \nagree with Mr Kolomoisky in a remarkably informal way that he would take on and \npay many of the most important members of PBC’s staff?  There was never a properly \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n48 \n evidenced answer to these questions , apart from the rather weak explanation given in \nthe Enyo letter from which I have quoted above.  In my view, the right  inference to \ndraw is that it was in Mr Bogolyubov ’s interests  to keep the PBC team  together , because \ntheir  knowledge of the relationship between the Individual Defendants a nd the Bank \npre-nationalisation  was information the dissemination of which it was in his interests \nto continue to control .

W hat occurred in relation to the individuals employed post -\nnationalisation by Sunaltezza and Grizal is a small but nevertheless significant extra \npiece of information which confirms the Bank’s case as to his interest in and control of \nthe Borrowers, the Intermediary Borrowers and PBC . \n176. In these circumstances, and in the light of the way that disclosure was carried out in this \ncase, I am not satisfied that all electronic communications between the Individual \nDefendants during the period relevant to these proceedings have been disclosed or even \nidentified.  I am not in a position to determine whether those which have not been \ndisclosed have bee n destroyed and if so when, but what is clear is that the fact that \nelectronic communications between the Individual Defendants during periods critic al \nto this case have not been disclosed does not establish that no such electronic \ncommunications occurred.   \n177. I also accept the Bank’s submission that the number of specific disclosure orders which \nthe court was required to make during the course of these proceedings illustrates why I \ncannot be satisfied that, even taking into account what has been destroyed, all \ndocumen tation in the control of the Individual Defendants relevant to the disclosure \nissues has seen the light of the day.  Indeed I am satisfied that it almost certainly has \nnot.  This means that the absence of documentation in relation to matters in whic h they \nmight have been expected to have been involved is no evidence that they were not in \nfact involved.  It seems to me that this is more particularly the case when taken together \nwith their decision not to give evidence.  I think it is likely that if th ey had done so, \ntheir cross -examination would have further supported the Bank’s  case that the Relevant \nEntities were all controlled by the Individual Defendants . \n178. A further issue of  concern relating to the availability of relevant documentation is \nreflected in the evidence of Ms Pakhachuk .  She  joined the Bank as deputy chair of the \nManagement Board at the time of nationalisation and described in her witness statement \nthe immense challenges faced by the Bank’s new management when they took over \nrunning its affairs.  One paragraph is worth citing  in full because it gives a clear picture, \nnot challenged in cross -examination, of why the Bank’s own records were incomplet e: \n“As well as existing staff being actively unhelpful,  we were also facing a situation \nwhere hard and soft copy documents were routinely missing from the Bank's files. \nIn my view, there had been a deliberate attempt to ‘clean out ’ the Bank’s documents \nbefore the nationalisation. This was particularly clear for one of the departments \nfor which I was ultimately responsible after my appointment,  the Investment \nBusiness Department, which was previously headed by Mr Novikov. The offices \nof that department had been  completely emptied by the time I started at the Bank, \nby which I mean they were stripped of everything: the filing cabinets were \ncompletely empty  and even the plug sockets had been removed from the wall. The \nmajority of the staff in the Investment Business Department simply left after the \nnationalisation, and I believe that those who remained only stayed in order to work \nto undermine and mislead us. ” \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n49 \n 179.

There was no evidence that  the Individual Defendants were directly involved, and to \nthat extent there is no warrant for drawing any adverse inference s against them  arising \nout of what occurred.  I cannot exclude the possibility that this was done on their \ninstructions or with their approval , but the Bank has not sought to prove that it was .  It \nfollows that the only inference it is appropr iate for me to draw is that it is no answer to \nthe Bank’s case that documents in a particular form would have existed if it were to be \ncorrect ; it is just as likely that they were destroyed as part of the exercise described by \nMs Pakhachuk , as it is that they never existed in the first place.   As will appear, t he \nstate in which the Ba nk’s affairs were found on nationalisation  is also relevant to an \nassessment of one part of the Limitation Defence : viz. whether it is appropriate for the \ncourt to exercise its discretion to disapply the limitation period if it is necessary to do \nso. \n \nAbsent witnesses  and deficient disclosure : the inferences to be drawn  \n180. More  generally, I think it is likely that the decision of the Individual Defendants not to \ngive evidence in support of their own defences was materially influenced by a \nrecognition that there was no underlying commercial rationale for the loan recycling \nscheme.  They were  unable to advance an explanation sufficient to rebut the strong \ninference that the scheme involved a misuse of the Bank’s money and a gross breach \nof duty to the Bank by those involved  in what occurred.  Furthermore, I think it likely \nthat they both recognised that by giving evidence in person they would expose \nthemselves to questioning about their role in the Misappropriation  to which they would \nhave had no credible exculpatory answer and they therefore chose to decline to do so.  \n181. I am fortified in reaching this conclusion by the fact that, earlier in these proceedings, \nit was accepted on behalf of Mr Kolomoisky that, if the matter ever went to trial, he \nwould need to explain what was going on, why it was done and whether there was any \ndishonest intent.  On the face of it, this amounted to a recognition, which in my view \nwas justified, that there was a burden on the Defendants to explain what had occurred.   \nIt is therefore clear that Mr Kolomoisky had throughout  contemplated that som e oral \nevidence would be advanced by him to clarify his position in relation to the \nMisappropriation.   It is also c lear that both of the Individual Defendants took the same \nview when they served their witness statements in support of their respective defences.  \n182. One of the principal reasons that both of the Individual Defendants declined to give \nevidence in person and in the case of Mr Kolomoisky withdr ew the witnesses he had \noriginally intended to call was that their cross -examination would have been likely to \nhave strengthened the Bank’s case not just that they controlled the Bank, but also that \nthey were the true UBOs of many if not all of the Borrowers, the Intermediary \nBorrowers, the Corporate Defendants, the ED Principals and the New Borrowers.   I \nhave also concluded that the principal reason for Mr Kolomoisky’s decision not to \nadduce evidence at the trial from Mr Kazantsev, Ms Koryak and Mr M Pugach , was the \nlikelihood that exposing them to cross -examination on the evidence they had given \nearlier in the proceedings would  damage the Defendants’ case .

Something similar  can be said about Mr Dubilet and the other individuals who played \na central role in the Misappropriation, but who were not put forward to explain what \noccurred or to support the Individual Defendants’ case that they were not involved.  I \nam satisfied that one of the principal reasons why none of the Defendants sought to \nadduce evidence from them  in these proceedings  is the likelihood that , if they had been \ncalled, they would have undermined the case of both of the Individual Defendants tha t \nthey did not know of or approve the Relevant Loans or the purposes for which they \nwere advanced .  Put another way , they had highly relevant evidence to give , were \navailable to the Defendants to do  so and it is to be expected that  they would have been \ncalled if the Individual Defendants did not have countervailing reasons for not doing \nso.   \n184. The consequence of the se decisions by the  Individual Defendants was that no evidence \nof fact was called by any of the Defendants.  They did, however, call expert evidence \nfrom a forensic accountant and from asset valuers, some of which took the form of \nanalysing the Bank’s documentation for the p urpose of describing what occurred as part \nof the alleged Misappropriation and the Asset Transfers used to reduce the outstanding \nbalances on the Relevant Loans.  I shall discuss that evidence later in this judgment . \n \nIntroduction to t he Bank and its management  \n185. The Bank is a Ukrainian joint stock company originally established in March 1992 by \nthe Individual Defendants (together with others including Aleksey Martynov) as a \nlimited liability company.  In 2000 the Bank was reorganised into a closed joint -stock \nentity and then became a public joint -stock company limited by shares in 2009.  I shall \nexplain the way in which the Bank’s shares were held in a little more detail when \ndescribing the structure and powers of its general meeting of shareholders (the “General \nMeeting”)  but, until its nationalisation in December 2016 , each of the Individual \nDefendants held a major stake in the Bank (albeit in each case falling just short of 50%) \nand together always held more than 90% of its issued shares.  \n186. The Bank’s financial statements disclosed that its principal business activity was \ncommercial and retail banking operations within Ukraine, having operated under a full \nbanking licence issued by the NBU since the time it was established.  At the time of it s \nnationalisation in 2016, the Bank had 30 regional offices and more than 2,400 branches \nin Ukraine, a branch in Cyprus and an associated bank in Latvia.  It had a well -\nestablished systemic significance to the banking market in Ukraine, which is illustrate d \nby the fact that at the end of 2012 it had approximately 13 million individual customers \nand over 450,000 corporate customers across Ukraine.  At that stage it was said by the \nNBU to be the country’s leading deposit taker from legal entities with almost 10% of \nthe market.  \n187. It is at the heart of the Bank’s case against both of the Individual Defendants that not \nonly did they have (as between themselves) a major controlling stake in the Bank, but \nalso that they used that control to procure the Misappropriation.

It is at the heart of the Bank’s case against both of the Individual Defendants that not \nonly did they have (as between themselves) a major controlling stake in the Bank, but \nalso that they used that control to procure the Misappropriation.  It is said tha t one of \nthe ways they did so was by exercising a dominant influence over the operation of the \nformal structures for which the Bank’s charter (the “Charter”) provided.  There is no \ndoubt that the extent of their interest as co -owners of more than 90% of th e Bank’s \nshares gave the Individual Defendants the opportunity to exercise actual control of the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n51 \n Bank through its formal structures, and there is also no doubt that they both played an \nactive part in the functioning of  both the General Meeting and the Supervisory Board, \nthe work of which I shall come on to explain.  \n188. However, the Individual Defendants deny that they were involved in the management \nof the Bank’s business and more specifically, they deny that they were responsible for \nthe Bank’s decisions to grant loans, or the terms of such loans including the security to \nbe required.  Mr Kolomoisky pleaded that all such decisions were made by Mr Dubilet, \nacting on the recommendation of the ECC.  He also denied that he was responsible for \nany decisions to lend without special resolution of the Supervisory Board where suc h \nwas required, or that he was responsible for any decision to accept sham documentation \nto support the making of particular loans.  He said that he was not responsible for the \ncompilation of the Bank’s list of related parties and pleaded that they were pr epared by \nthe Bank’s compliance department and approved by Mr Dubilet and the Management \nBoard.  \n189. More particularly, it was Mr Kolomoisky’s pleaded case that he did not procure and \nwas not aware of the grant of the Relevant Loans, the advances of funds pursuant to \nthem (and therefore the Relevant Drawdowns), the Relevant Supply Agreements , the \nIntermediary Loans or the LFSAs.  He also denied the Bank’s allegation that the \nCorporate Defendants were owned or controlled by him and that he owned or controlled \nany of the ED Principals during the relevant period.  As to the Borrowers and \nIntermediary Borrower s he did not admit having an interest in all of them but did admit \nto having an interest in some.  Mr Bogolyubov’s pleaded case was similar to that of Mr \nKolomoisky although expressed in more general terms.  He emphasised that, although \nhe was chairman of the Bank’s Supervisory Board throughout the relevant period, all \nsignificant decisions, including in particular all significant corporate lending decisions, \nwere made by the Management Board.  \n190. So far as the Misappropriation is concerned, the Bank’s allegation s of control are not \nsupported by any direct documentary evidence confirming that any single one of the \nRelevant Loans was specifically authorised or procured by either of the Individual \nDefendants, nor is there any direct documentary evidence that they knew t hat any single \none of the Borrowers would use the proceeds of a Relevant Drawdown to fund an \nUnreturned Prepayment.  However, it was submitted, and I accept, that the extent of \ntheir sta ke in the Bank, the roles and influence which they had in consequence of their \nstake in the Bank and the nature of the relationship they had with the individuals who \nmanaged the Bank on a day to day basis is all evidence which is capable of supporting \nthe allegation.

As wil l appear , their legal rights as shareholders and members of the \nSupervisory Board , as well as how they in fact acted in  practice,  provided a solid \nfoundation  for the Bank’s allegation that they must have been involved in the planning \nand implementation of the Misappropriation.  \n191. In order to put this is context, I will first explain the Bank’s formal governance and \nmanagement structures, the roles which the Individual Defendants had within those \nstructures and the extent to which those structures featured in the events which form \nthe subject matter of these proceedings.   This sets the context for the evidence as to \nwhat happened on the ground.  That evidence establishes the likelihood that, throughout \nthe material period, the Individual Defendants  exercised an informal controlling \ninfluence over the conduct by the Bank of its affairs, which was both consistent with \nand enabled by their status as shareholders and their formal roles in the governance of \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n52 \n the Bank, most particularly as members of the Supervisory Board.  However, while it \nis clear that in general terms the Individual Defendants exercised influence over each \nof these bodies, the extent to which each of them did so in relation to the \nMisapprop riation is a matter in relation to which I shall have to make more specific \nfindings in due course.  \n192. The formal governance and management structures of the Bank, also called its \nmanagement bodies, were the General Meeting, the Supervisory Board and the \nManagement Board.  The constitution and powers of these bodies were governed by \nthe Charter, which itself was amended by the General Meeting on a number of \noccasions during the relevant period of time.   In large part the evidence from which I \nhave drawn my findings in relation to the Bank’s formal structures was  not contested , \nalthough there are a number of respects in which the way in which the Individual \nDefendants exercised their rights in relation to those formal str uctures was . \n \nThe General Meeting  \n193. The General Meeting , described as the supreme management body of the Bank, was the \nforum in and through which the Bank’s shareholders, including but not exclusively the \nIndividual Defendants, were entitled to exercise their rights to influence and control its \naffairs.  The Ukrainian Law on Banks and Banking (the “Law on Banks”) a nd the \nCharter provided for a number of strategic and policy issues to be within the exclusive \ncompetence of the General Meeting.  These included making determinations as to the \nmain direction of the Bank’s activities, the approval of reports on their impl ementation, \nand the appointment and removal of members of the Supervisory Board.  \n194. It follows that,  in their capacity as shareholders , the Individual Defendants had the legal \npower,  when acting together, to exercise control over both the Supervisory Board and \nultimately the Management Board.  Their right to do so was conferred and regulated by \nclause 9.2 of the Charter and by Article 38 of the Law on Banks, which gave to the \nGeneral Meeting exclusive competence to make decisions as to the main direction of \nthe Bank's activities (including approval of reports on their implementation ) and t he \nappointment and dismissal of chairmen and members of the Supervisory Board, which \nitself was responsible for the appointment of members of the Management Board . \n195.

The evidence established that, short ly before nationalisation, more than 49 .98% of the \nBank’s share capital was held either directly or indirectly by Mr Kolomoisky, and in \nexcess of 41 .58% of its share capital was held either directly or indirectly by Mr \nBogolyubov.   The precise extent of the Individual Defendants’ respective interests in \nthe Bank had changed from time to time during the course of the preceding six year \nperiod.  Notwithstanding these relatively minor variations in interest, it was always th e \ncase that Mr Kolomoisky’s direct or indirect holding in the Bank was more than 45% \nand Mr Bogolyubov’s was more than 41%, and together they always held more than \n90% of the Bank’s shares.  As at 31 December 2013, which was the end of the financial \nyear i n which the first of the Relevant Loans was made, the Individual Defendants  held \ndirect or indirect stakes in the Bank, amounting to 46.33% in the case of Mr \nKolomoisky and 46.66% in the case of Mr Bogolyubov.   It was not unusual during this \nsix year perio d for the Individual Defendants to have an equal interest in the Bank’s \nshares.  Thus, a s at 8 March 2015  (the date at which Ukrainian law changed in relation \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n53 \n to the definition of related parties for bank control purposes) , Mr Kolomoisky and Mr \nBogolyubov were each recorded as being the direct or indirect holder of 45.08% of the \nBank’s capital . \n196. As to whether or not the Bank’s formal records demonstrated that the Individual \nDefendants acted in conjunction with each other, its financial statements for the year \nended 31 December 2013 recorded that neither of them individually controlled the Bank \nand that there was no contractual agreement between them on joint control.  This \nstatement of position continued to be maintained in the financial statements for the 2014 \nand 2015 financial statements, although in the case of the latter, Mr Kolomoisky’s \ninterest was recorded as having increased to 49.99% while that of Mr Bogolyubov was \nrecorded as having reduced to 41.59%.  \n197. However, s ubject to one point, which is  an important one from Mr Bogolyubov’s \nperspective, there is no evidence that t he Individual Defendants  ever exercised their \nrights as shareholders other than in conjunction with each other and to that extent \nexercised joint control.  It follows from this that the membership of the Supervisory \nBoard was controlled by the General Meeting, which was itself controlled at all material \ntimes by the Individual Defendants .  The qualification is that Mr Bogolyubov contends \nthat from July 2014, he stepped back from involvement in the Bank’s affairs, agreeing \nto exercise his rights as a shareholder in accordance with the instructions of Mr \nKolomoisky .  This is a point to which I will return in due course,  but, although relevant \nto the extent of Mr Bogolyubov’s  likely involvement in the Bank’s affairs thereafter, \nthis did not  affect the strict legal position as between the two Individual Defendants and \nthe other  shareholders entitled to vote  at the General Meeting.  Even if  Mr Bogo lyubov  \nwas contractually bound to follow Mr Kolomoisky’s instructions , he remained the legal \nowner of the relevant shares , and he  continue d to exercise his legal rights as such in \nconjunction with Mr Kolomoisky . \n198.

As I have already \nexplained, t hey included a number of individuals who were available to give evidence \non behalf  of the Individual Defendants  but did not do so : Mr Dubilet, Mr Novikov, Ms \nGurieva, Mr Yatsenko, Mr Pikush , Mr Gorokhovsky, and  Ms Chmona.

It is clear to me  that this is a \nfair description  of the relationship between these individuals and the Individual \nDefendants.  \n199. Given the size of the minority shareholdings and the relationship which the minority \nshareholders had with the Individual Defendants , it is not particularly surprising that \nthey did not do anything in their capacity as shareholders which demonstrated any \nmaterial independence from the Individual Defendants.  There is, however, some basic \ndocumentary support for this being the case, q uite apart from the probabilities  arising \nout of  the manner  in which the Bank’s affairs were structured and manage d.  Thus,  the \nminutes of the General Meetings for the relevant period (i.e. 2013 -2016) demonstrate \nthat resolutions, whether for the appointment of members of the Supervisory Board, the \napproval of the Bank’s  annual accounts, the amendment of the C harter or the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n54 \n distribution of the Bank’s recorded profits by increasing its share capital, were always \npassed unanimously.  This extended both to their positive approval of the formal and \nstrategic decisions that were made at the General Meeting and to the fact that non e of \nthem are recorded as ever having sought the implementation of anything that was not \ninitiated or approved by the Individual Defendants as majority shareholders ; there is no \nother evidence that steps to that end were ever taken by any of them.  \n200. In practice, throughout the period in which the Misappropriation was taking place, the \nGeneral Meeting always acted unanimously.  T he matters which a General Meeting \napproved extended not just to the Bank’s annual report, balance sheet and consolidated \nfinancial statements, amendments to the Charter and the use of the Bank’s profits, but \nalso to approval of the conduct of the Bank’s business by its supervisory and executive \nbodies.  Thus, at both the 2013 and 2014 meetings at which the accounts for the \npreceding years were approved, the operation of the Management Board and the \nSupervisory Board was deemed satisfactory and a resolution was passed approving the \nBank’s key business areas.  The relevant resolutions were passed on the unanimous \nvote of the Bank’ s shareholders, including relevantly for present purposes, both of the \nIndividual Defendants.  \n201. It is also of some relevance  to the defence run by Mr Bogolyubov  that the shareholders \ncontinued to vote for the annual profits to be kept as retained earnings throughout the \nperiod Mr Bogolyubov says that he had stepped back from the affairs of the Bank.  This \nis said to have taken place first on his move from Ukraine  to England in 2009 , and then \nmore substantively after July 2014 when he says that h e had agreed to exerci se the \nvoting rights attach"}

It is also of some relevance  to the defence run by Mr Bogolyubov  that the shareholders \ncontinued to vote for the annual profits to be kept as retained earnings throughout the \nperiod Mr Bogolyubov says that he had stepped back from the affairs of the Bank.  This \nis said to have taken place first on his move from Ukraine  to England in 2009 , and then \nmore substantively after July 2014 when he says that h e had agreed to exerci se the \nvoting rights attached to his shares at the sole direction or instruction of Mr  \nKolomoisky .  This is a point to which I will return, but there is at least a tension which \ndemands explanation between what Mr Bogolyubov asserted to be a cessation in his \ninvolvement in and support for the Bank (combined with what was said to have been \nan agreement by him to cease exercising the rights which attached to his shares ), and \nhis agreement to continue to allow the profits generated by the Bank to be applied in a \nmanner from which he obtained no obvious continuing benefit.  \n \nThe Supervisory Board  \n202. As I said at the beginning of this judgment, the Individual Defendants were both \nmembers of the Supervisory Board between 2003 or 2004 (the precise date does not \nmatter) and nationalisation at the end of 2016.  Throughout the period in which the \nMisappropr iation is said to have taken place and for some time thereafter , Mr \nBogolyubov was the chairman  of the Supervisory Board and the only other member \napart from the Individual Defendants was Mr Martynov.  After 30 April 2015, two \nadditional members of the Sup ervisory Board were appointed: Victor Lisitskyi and \nVolodymyr Stelmakh, although they did not begin to attend meetings until mid June \n2015 when Mr Stelmakh took over the chairmanship from Mr Bogolyubov.  \n203. It follows that the legal rights of the Individual Defendants were not just exercisable \nthrough their shareholdings in the Bank.  They were further exercisable through their \nmembership of the Supervisory Board, which acting together they controlled by reas on \nof their shareholding.  From 1 May 2015, they did not (even acting together) have a \nmajority of the votes on the Supervisory Board, but even then there is no evidence that \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n55 \n the Supervisory Board ever took any decisions which were inconsistent with the wishes \nof both Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov as to how the affairs of the Bank ought to \nbe conducted.  In short, the evidence demonstrates that, even after May 2015, they \ncontinued to  control the Supervisory Board  both through their continuing role as \nmembers and their ability as shareholders to control the composition of its membership.  \n204. The Law on Banks and the Charter made provision for the powers with which the \nSupervisory Board was vested.  They included powers for the protection of the rights \nof depositors, other creditors and shareholders and powers to appoint and dismiss the \nmembers of the Management Board a nd to control and propose improvements to its \nactivities.  To that end, the Charter contained a lengthy and wide -ranging list of specific \nsupervisory functions which it was required to carry out, supplemented by regulations.  \nThe Charter also provided for its competence to extend to making transactional (rather \nthan merely supervisory) decisions, such as where transactions exceeded US$500,000 \nin value and where transactions were proposed with related parties.  Its role also \nextended to the crit ical question of monitoring the effectiveness of the Bank’s risk \nmanagement system, as well as defining and approving its risk management strategies, \npolicies and procedures, including risks and limit levels.  \n205. Mr Kolomoisky accepted in his Defence that, as a member of the Supervisory Board, \nhe was “involved in making some of the decisions made by the Bank at various times”.  \nBut he also pleade"}

Its role also \nextended to the crit ical question of monitoring the effectiveness of the Bank’s risk \nmanagement system, as well as defining and approving its risk management strategies, \npolicies and procedures, including risks and limit levels.  \n205. Mr Kolomoisky accepted in his Defence that, as a member of the Supervisory Board, \nhe was “involved in making some of the decisions made by the Bank at various times”.  \nBut he also pleaded that the Supervisory Board did not manage the Bank on a day to \nday basis and that, so far as he rec alled, none of the transactions which formed part of \nthe Misappropriation were referred to or approved by the Supervisory Board.  He also \nasserted that m any decisions which might be characterised as “significant” were made \nby executive officers of the Bank without his involvement . \n206. Mr Bogolyubov pleaded in his Defence that, a s chairman of the Supervisory Board, he \nwas not responsible for, nor did he manage or exercise day -to-day control over the \nBank, and he had only a high -level general supervisory role.   The way it was put in his \nwritten opening (and again in closing) was that his role as such, like his role as a \nshareholder, was “limited and formal”.  It was  said that he w as not responsible for, nor \ndid he control, the lending decisions taken by the Bank  and that he had no other \nexecutive or administrative role within the Bank.   It was also said that the evidence \nshowed very clearly that the Supervisory Board was not being kept informed by the \nBank’s management about the way it was running the Bank.  \n207. Mr Bogolyubov also relied on clause 9.1 of the Charter , which provided that “The \nSupervisory Board does not participate in the Bank’s current management”.  However, \nthat is to take only part of the clause, and is capable of being misleading divorced from \nits proper context.  The preceding sentence is important as wel l, because it makes plain \nthat the Supervisory Board’s remit was not intended to be that of some toothless or \nlargely irrelevant supervisor.  It is “the body that protects the rights of deposito rs, other \ncreditors and shareholders of the Bank, and within its competence, monitors and \nregulates the activities of the Management Board”.  \n208. More generally, the Bank did not accept that the way in which the Individual \nDefendants characterised their roles was accurate and I agree with its submission that \nthey both significantly downplayed the true extent to which they participated in the \nbusiness of the Bank.  The Supervisory Board met regularly throughout the period 2013 \nto 2016.  The trial bundle contained minutes of 28 meetings during the course of 2013, \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n56 \n 40 meetings during the course of 2014, 54 meetings during the course of 2015 and 81 \nmeetings in 2016.  Many of these were short but, until the end of April 2015, they were \nall recorded as having been attended by Mr Bogolyubov as chairman and a wide range \nof issues were considered.   It was only when Mr Lisitskyi and Mr Stelmakh were \nappointed to the Supervisory Board in April 2015 that minutes started to record Mr \nKolomoisky as attending as well as Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Martynov.  All five \nmembers then contin ued to attend regularly right through to nationalisation.  \n209. During the period in which Mr Bogolyubov was chairman, these meetings included  \nconsideration of a corporate code of ethics for the Privatbank  group, the procedure for \nremunerating the Bank’s senior management and issues relating to the Bank’s corporate \nrisk management .

This \nactivity occurr ed during the period of time the Misappropriation was taking place.  They \nalso approved changes to  the membership of the Management Board. \n210. Between the time at which Mr Stelmakh took over the chairmanship from Mr \nBogolyubov and the Bank’s nationalisation, there were 112 meetings almost all of \nwhich were recorded as having been attended by both Mr Kolomoisky and Mr \nBogolyubov  which continued to deal with a range of matters.  These included i nternal \nregulations on the production of the Bank’s related party list , the appointment of EY in \nMay 2015 to produce a report on  related parties, reviews and approval of various \nversions of the Bank’s restruc turing plan  (the “Restructuring Plan”) , including the \ntransfer of assets onto the Bank’s balance sheet as part of the Asset Transfers and, \nshortly before nationalisation, a resolution to implement measures in response to the \nviolations and recommendations identified in a report from the NBU.  \n211. It was said in the  written opening submissions prepared on behalf of Mr Bogolyubov \nthat the minutes do not record that any  actual meetings of the Supervisory Board \nactually took place . That is a somewhat cryptic way of expressing his position, because \nhe does not assert that there were in fact no  actual meetings held , nor has he adduced \nany evidence that they were not.  It was also submitted on his behalf that such as \noccurred were mere formalities in which he engaged in no debate or simply acted as a \nrubber stamp of approval to motions proposed by the Bank’s manageme nt. \n212. In my view this submission was unsupported by any credible evidence, and I think that \nthe Bank was justified in contending that such evidence as there is contradicts it.  A \ngood example is the discussions which took place at meetings of the Supervisory Boa rd \nchaired by Mr Bogolyubov between April 2013 and April 2015 in relation to successive \nversions of the Bank’s financial recovery programme.  All of these meetings were \nrecorded as having lasted for identified periods of time, and involved both a review by  \nthose present of the information presented by management and a consideration of the \nrecovery programme as the only item on the agenda.  All of the minutes were signed \nby Mr Bogolyubov and there is no evidence that , by using words such as review and \nconsideration , he was carrying out an exercise that was no more than a rubber stamp.  \n213. One example to which the Bank drew specific attention was a meeting held towards the \nend of the period in which the Relevant Drawdowns were being made, at which the \nSupervisory Board was recorded as having considered and approved detailed \ndocumentation in relation to the Bank’s need for a stabilisation loan and an increase in \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n57 \n its regulatory capital.   The meeting approved, under the signature of Mr Bogolyubov, \nthe Bank’s financial recovery programme for 2014 to 2016, which had been proposed \nby the Management Board.  This contained detailed proposals for improving the Bank’s \nfinancial condition and reduc ing overdue customer debt and for the shareholders to \nrecapitalise the Bank with additional shareholder contributions of UAH 3,345 million, \nprofit capitalisation of UAH 665 million and a substantial further amount of \nsubordinated d ebt.

In my view, the extent of the material which was considered and \nthe way that this exercise was recorded as having been carried out is wholly inconsistent \nwith the suggestion made on behalf of Mr Bogolyubov that he only had a high-level \ngeneral supervisory role  and everything he did was nothing more than “limited and \nformal”.  \n \nThe Management Board  \n214. The Management Board was the Bank’s executive body responsible for managing its \ncurrent operations.  The competence of the Management Board extended to all matters \nrelating to the Bank’s operations except those which were within the exclusive \ncompetence of another body such as the General Meeting or the Supervisory Board.  In \nlarge part its function was therefore different from that of the Supervisory Board , which \nwas required to be independent of it ; this requirement was reflected by a prohibition on \nany m ember of the Supervisory Board also being a member of the Management Board.  \nIts functions included the taking of decisions to enter into major transactions where \ntheir subject was worth less than 10% of the value of the Bank’s assets. Where the \nsubject ma tter of the transaction was more than 10% of the value of the Bank’s assets \nthe relevant decision was a matter for the Supervisory Board or the General Meeting \ndepending on the ultimate value.  \n215. The membership of the Management Board was controlled by the Supervisory Board , \nand was therefore controlled by the Individual Defendants .  This meant that their \nappointees on the Management Board controlled all matters relating to the Bank’s day \nto day operations.   The Management Board comprised the individuals listed in \nparagraph 198 above as minority shareholders and a number of other individuals who \ndid not feature in the evidence to any material extent, but almost all of whom also held \nsmall shareholdings in the Bank.  Most but not all of the members of the Management \nBoard were al so involved in approving Relevant Loans in their capacities as members \nof the ECC.   \n216. At the highest level of generality i t is indisputable that the Management Board was \ncontrolled by the Individual Defendants in their capacity as two of the three members \nof the Supervisory Board.  In that capacity , they had the power of appointment to the \nManagement Board, and it was only after 30 April 2015 that they were capable of being \noutvoted by the three non -shareholder members of the Supervisory Board, who in \npractice never indicated any dissent from that which the Individual Defendants wished \nto ac hieve.  To that extent, they had a very considerable influence over the activities of \nthe Management  Board.  T o the extent that they knew what  was going on, there is no \ndoubt that their views as to  how any particular issue ought to be decided or resolved \nwould  be determinative .   \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n58 \n 217. It was the Bank’s case that the more significant members of the Manage ment Board \nhad close relationships with one or both of the Individual Defendants.  It was submitted \nthat, in consequence of this  (a) it is unlikely that th ese individuals would be party to \nactivity contrary to the interests of the Bank , and to that extent which was capable of \nhaving an adverse impact on the legitimate interests  of the Individual Defendants in \ntheir capacity as shareholders in the Bank, without the ir active or tacit approv al, and (b) \nit is likely  that they were accustomed to act on the instructions of the Individual \nDefendants in relation to matters which aff"}

I agree with the Bank that t here was  a great deal of evidence which linked the more \nimportant members of the Management Board to both of the Individual Defendants.  In \nsome respects that is not surprising , because they were  all senior executives within the \nBank, of which the Individual Defendants were the controlling shareholders.   However, \nbecause both Mr Bogolyubov and (to a lesser extent Mr Kolomoisky)  sought to distance \nthemselves from the day to day management of the Bank’s affairs, it is necessary, in  so \nfar as it is possible to do so, to give some colour to the relationships they both had with \nthese members of management.  T aken overall, it builds a picture from which I have \nconcluded that the Bank’s submission that these individuals would not be party to \nactivity contrary to the interests of the Bank without the active or tacit approval of the \nIndividual Defendants is justified . \n219. I shall develop my conclusions as to the nature of th e relationship between the more \nimportant and relevant members of the Management Board and  the Individual \nDefendants a little later in the judgment, but at this stage I will simply  summarise who \nthese individuals were , and the extent of their participation in the formal aspects of the \nmaking of the Relevant Loans.  The first four were  individual s whom the Bank contends \nthe Defendants could and should have called to give evidence at the trial.  I have alrea dy \ngiven a brief description of their role when discussing the significance of the fact that \nthey did not do so.   \n220. The first is Mr Dubilet.  He was the pre -nationalisation chair man of the Management \nBoard, having been appointed in April 1997,  and was the person said by Mr \nKolomoisky to be responsible for the decisions made by the Bank to grant loans , the \nterms of the loans including the security to be required and the compilation of the \nBank’s list of related parties.   As at  8 March 2015 , he held a 3.2%  interest in  the shares \nin the Bank.  He was the third largest shareholder  in the Bank, but his interest was very \nsmall in comparison to that of the Individual Defendants.  He signed 115 of the \nagreements for R elevant Loans and chaired the ECC at which each of the Relevant \nLoans was authorised . \n221. The second  is Mr Novikov.  He was a first deputy  chair  of the Management Board pre -\nnationalisation , head of the Bank’s Investment Business  and was in charge of  Primecap .  \nAs at 8 March 2015, he held a 1.6% interest in the Bank ’s shares .  He was a member of \nthe ECC and was present at almost all of the meetings at which  the Relevant Loans \nwere authorised , approving 127 of them.  \n222. The third is Ms Gurieva.  She was a deputy chair of the Management Board pre -\nnationalisation and head of BOK, which was one of the  Bank’s department s which \nfeatured heavily in the trial and from which the Relevant Loans to all 46 of the 47 \nUkrainian  Borrowers originated  (see paragraph 237 below) .  She was a member of the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n59 \n ECC and approved 129 of the Relevant Loans .  As at 8 March 2015, she held a 0.28% \ninterest in the Bank ’s shares .   \n223. The fourth  is Mr Yatsenko.

As at 8 March 2015, she held a 0.28% \ninterest in the Bank ’s shares .   \n223. The fourth  is Mr Yatsenko.   He was a first deputy chair of the Management Board pre -\nnationalisation and head of the Bank’s corporate VIP business department.   He too \napproved 129 of the Relevant Loans as a member  of the ECC .  As at 8 March 2015, he \nheld a 0.38% interest in the Bank . \n224. The next three were individuals  whom the Bank did not assert the Defendants should \nhave called to give evidence , but who featured to a material extent in the documents .  \nAll three of them were important members of the Management Board and  the ECC  who \ndemonstrated a continuing loyalty to the Individual Defendants (and more especially \nMr Kolomoisky) after what the Bank called the active stage of the Misappropriation \nwas complete.  I shall say a little more about them a t this stage . \n225. The first is Mr Pikush.  He was the general deputy chair of the Management Board pre -\nnationalisation and responsible for compliance.   Like Mr Yatsenko, he also approved \n129 of the Relevant Loans as a member  of the ECC and , as at 8 March 2015 , held a \n0.38% interest in the Bank . \n226. Mr Pi kush was involved both in what the Bank called the active stage of the \nMisappropriation and also in subsequent relevant events.  Thus, from October 2013 \nonwards (i.e. during the period in which he was approving the Relevant Loans,  as to \nwhich see paragraph 225 above) he was also participating in the production of the \nBank’s related party lists for submission to the NBU.  These lists were prepared by the \ncompliance department headed by Mr Luchaninov and submitted for comment by him \nand Mr Dubilet.  Mr Pikush w as also the recipient of correspondence sent by Mr \nLuchaninov  in February 2014 which made clear th at the NBU had concerns about the \nfailure of the Bank to provide information about certain clients of its Cypr us branch.   \nHe seems from t his correspondence to have appreciated  that it may be necessary to \nprovide what he called the ‘right ’ documents to an NBU  inspector , which the evidence \n(as elucidated in cross -examination of Mr Luchaninov) indicates was probably done in \norder to conceal the concentration  of related parties amongst the relevant Cypr us branch \nclients .   \n227. In February 2015, Mr Pikush  was instructed to investigate the facts behind the \ndisclosure of confidential information  leading to publication by an  investigative \njournalism group called NashiGroshi of two web articles (the “NashiGroshi Articles”) .  \nI will return to these article s in the context of the Limitation Defence , but it was alleged  \nthat companies connected to the Individual Defendants had misappropriated US$1.8 \nbillion from the Bank.  Like Mr Yatsenko, h e was also one of  the recipient s of the \nLuchaninov  e-mail. \n228. The role he fulfilled was also reflected in the fact that later on (very shortly before  \nnationalisation) he was one of the recipients of the correspondence about the lack of \n“acceptable collaterals” for the T ransformation and the NBU’ s concerns that the New \nBorrowers had what Mr Luchaninov called a “ non-transparent ownership structure ; \nlack of company cash flows ; and small staff sizes .”  In my view, the evidence \nestablishes that Mr Pikush was closely involved in events around the active stage of the \nMisappr opriation and its aftermath, although there is no evidence that he continued to \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n60 \n have a relationship with Mr Kolomoisky or Mr Bogolyubov after he left the Bank at the \ntime of its nationalisation.   \n229.

The second is Mr Gorokhovsky.  He was a deputy chair of the Management Board from \nJanuary 2014 until nationalisation and head of the Bank’s credit card and salaries \ndepartment.  Like Mr Yatsenko and Mr Pikush, he also approved 129 of the Relevant \nLoans as a member  of the ECC  and, as at 8 March 2015, held a 0.38% interest in the \nBank . \n230. There is plenty of evidence that Mr Gorokhovsky  continued to be in close contact  with \nthe Individual Defendants (and indeed Mr Novikov and Mr Yatsenko ) during the period \nafter nationalisation .  Thus, h e attended at least one meeting in Geneva  in February \n2018 and in June 2018 lunched with Mr Kolomoisky and  Mr Novikov  on the shores of \nthe lake .  The tone of the correspondence surrounding that meeting indicates an intimate \npersonal relationship with Mr Kolomoisky  which seems to have continued  into 2019, \nflying with Mr Dubilet  and members of his family to Dnipro  in June 2019  on Mr \nKolomoisky’s private jet.  \n231. There were further indications of the closeness of the relationship between Mr \nKolomois ky and Mr G orokhovsky  during 2018 and 2019 when they exchanged \npersonal WhatsApp messages about such matters as football and birthday greetings.  \nThere were also Bank -related messages in which Mr Gorok hovsky was seeking \ninstructions from Mr Kolomoisky for the making of an unidentified payment and in \nwhich they exchanged forthright views on what they both regarded as the incompetence \nof the Bank’s post -nationalisation mana gement.  \n232. Although it was submitted on behalf of Mr Bogolyubov that there was no \ncontemporaneous evidence that Mr Gorokhovsky had ever demonstrated any loyalty to \nhim, that does not tell the whole story.  There is credible evidence from communications \nbetween Mr Gorokhovsky and Mr Kolomoisky that Mr Gorokhovsky continued to be \ninvolved in the joint business affairs of both of the Individual Defendants as late as June \n2019.  \n233. The third  is Ms Chmona .  She was a deputy chair of the Management  Board and head \nof the Bank’s budgeting department .  She was party to the approval of 126 of the \nRelevant Loans as a member  of the ECC, and like Ms Gurieva , as at 8 March 2015 , she \nheld a 0. 28% interest in the Bank . \n234. There were a number of other members of the Management Board, some of whom  held \nsmaller interests in the Bank’s share capital , and/or were members of the ECC involved \nin approving some of the Relevant Loans .  They did not feature in the evidence to the \nsame extent as the s even  individuals I have just identified , but there is no evidence to \nsuggest that , by participating in the  lending decisions in relation to the Relevant Loans , \nthey acted independently from the other members of the ECC .  I was shown  little if any \nevidence of their contact with the Individual  Defendants , but there is no reason to think \nthat any of them would have proceeded to participate in the authorisation of any of the \nRelevant Loans, if there were any indications that proceeding in this manner was not in \naccordance with what they understood to be the wishes and intentions of the Individual \nDefendants as the Bank’s majority shareholders.

There is no record that \nhe held any interest in the Bank’s shares . \niii) Lyubov Korotina, a member of the Management Board pre -nationalisation and \nthe B ank’s C hief Accountant .  Like Ms Shmalchenko,  she held a 0.19% interest \nin the Bank's shares . \n \nOther divisions within the  Bank  \n235. The Bank had a number of different operational divisions, relevant to the issues which \narose during the course of the trial.  They  included t hree departments whose employees \nwere involved in the transactions linked to the Misappropriation:  BOK , the Investment \nBusiness and the Industrial and Commercial Enterprise Budgeting Business  (referre d \nto by Mr Luchaninov as the Budgeting Business) . \n236. BOK was headed by Ms Gurieva.  Its primary function was described b y Mr \nLuchaninov as being to provide banking services to the Bank’s so called strategic \ncustomers which he understood to be companies within the Individual Defendants’ \nwider business group.  This understanding was confirmed by the evidence of Ms \nLozytska, the deputy head of client banking services in BOK’s client operations \naccounting department .  It operated in a secretive manner with client files kept in hard \ncopy in sealed cabinets and the  Bank’s employees working within BOK occupied \nseparate premises from the Bank’s other divisions.    \n237. BOK initiated the vast majority of the Bank’s largest corporate loans .  This included 46 \nof the 47 Relevant Loans to Ukr ainian Borrowers , the single exception being the \nRelevant Loan to  Prominmet , which according to the relevant ECC minutes , was \ninitiated by the credit analysts department (although, elsewhere in the papers, \nProminmet is recorded as a client of BOK) .  I will explain later a dispute on the extent \nto which Mr Bogolyubov gave instructions to BOK, but I am satisfied that the \nunderstanding which Mr Luchaninov and Ms Lozytska had as to BOK’s functions was \naccurate.  \n238. The Investment Business was headed by Mr Novikov.  The evidence did not reveal the \nfull extent of its activities but it was described by Mr Luchaninov as a department the \nworkings of which were not known to Bank employees outside the department itself \nand the Bank’s top management.  Ms Pakhachuk  described the department as being a \n“black box” , by which I understood her to mean a place whose internal workings she \ndid not understand .  What is clear, however, is that , prior to nationalisation , it had a role \nin designing and implementing the Individual Defendants’ asset holding structures and \nwas the custodian of information o n those who controlled or had significant \nshareholdings in the Bank .  In particular it  was responsible for maintaining the Bank’s \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n62 \n lists of related parties (both for IFRS and NBU reporting purposes) until October 2013.  \nIt retained the role of maintaining the NBU related parties list until nationalisation, but \nin October 2013 the role of maintaining the IFRS related parties list was t ransferred to \nthe compliance department.

The reason for this split was never explained to Mr \nLuchaninov even though he was head of the compliance department.   The likely \nsensitivity of the work carried out in the Investment Business and the reason that Ms \nPakhachuk described it as something of a “black box”  was explained in her  \nunchallenged evidence as to what she was faced with when she arrived at the Bank \nimmediately after nationalisat ion (see paragraph  178 above).  \n239. Whether or not initiated within BOK or the Bank’s Investment Business, loans were \nrequired to be approved by the ECC which was chaired by Mr Dubilet.  It was \nresponsible for approving the Relevant L oans. The evidence shows that none of the \nmeetings were held in person. The members recorded as having participat ed in the \nrelevant decision -making included several individuals whose role in the events which \nhave given rise to these proceedings I have already summarised: Mr Novikov , Ms \nGurieva , Mr Gorokhovsky, Mr  Yatsenko and Ms Chmona.   It was established that the \nevidence adduced by the Bank from Mr Luchaninov and Ms Lozytska that Ms Gurieva \nand Mr Novikov would have taken instructions directly from Mr Kolomoisky and Mr \nBogolyubov in relation to their work in BOK and the Bank’s Investment Business w as \nnot based on personal knowledge.   Nonetheless , there is powerful circumstantial \nevidence which established  that BOK and the Bank’s Investment  Business did not \noperate  independently from instructions given by the Ind ividual Defendants . \n240. The Budgeting Business was headed by Ms Chmon a.  It performed  a treasury function \nfor the assets of both of the Individual Defendants. As Mr Luc haninov explained , and I \naccept, its primary function was to set budgets and cash flow forecasts  for Mr \nKolomoisky  and Mr Bogolyubov’s  businesses . As he put it “Along with BOK, the \npurpose of the Budgeting Business was to keep Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov’s \nbusinesses operating ”. \n241. The Bank also had a branch in Cyprus  which featured regularly in the evidence. Its \ngeneral manager was Vladislav Morgachov and the Corporate Defendants were \namongst its customers.  It occupied the same building as Primecap (as to which see \nbelow).  The Cyprus  branch’s control systems were weak, as was apparent from reports \nprepared by both the Central Bank of Cyprus and the NBU , the conclusions of which \nare all consistent with other evidence : \ni) A report fr om the Central Bank of Cyprus dated 15 February 2016 was \nexpressed in trenchant terms:  \n“The failings of the Branch are considered serious and systemic, resulting in \nan inadequate and ineffective Anti -Money Laundering (''AML'') system, \nwhich is needed to identify, assess, and manage potential money laundering \nrisks. The weaknesses in the Branc h's policies, procedures and controls were \nalso identified in previous audits carried out by the CBC in 2007 and 2011, \nand the Branch failed to take sufficient measures to rectify these weaknesses \nand omissions, despite the CBC's instructions. ” \nii) An NBU inspection report from 27 July 2016 found that it was not independent \nfrom the Bank’s head office and was “fully dependent” on the head office’s \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n63 \n managerial decisions  and “acts as a tool for both the support of the Bank proper  \nand a vehicle serving the interests of a group of companies in which the Bank’s \nbeneficial owners have an interest” . \n \nThe Individual Defendants and their relationship  \n242.

Both of the Individual Defendants are well -known Ukrainian businessmen who have \nhad interests in a wide range of different businesses including not just the banking sector \nbut also ferroalloys, media, oil and gas trading and real estate.  They are close in  age \nand both of them are or were Ukrainian, Israeli and Cypriot nationals; Mr Bogolyubov \nalso has British citizenship.  They have been close friends and business partners since \nthe early 1990s and since then have worked together on what Mr Bogolyubov in ot her \nproceedings called “many projects and investments”.  They have had many jointly \nowned assets.  \n243. Mr Kolomoisky lived in Ukraine until 2003 when he began to  spend much of his time \nin France, Israel and Switzerland, becoming a Swiss resident based in Geneva in 2010.   \nHe became  governor of Dnipro petrovsk Oblast in 2014 , a post which he continued to \nhold until early 2015 , during a period in which many of the ev ents which are the subject \nof these proceedings occurred , after which he says that he lived in Geneva and Israel .  \nIt is clear that , wherever he may have resided, he continued to spend a material amo unt \nof time either in  Ukraine or occupied in the affairs of his Ukrainian assets .  He returned \nto Ukraine in 2019, where he remained at the time of trial, although he has now been \nstripped of his Ukrainian citizenship.  He is now in prison.  \n244. Mr Bogolyubov regarded himself as more international in outlook than Mr \nKolomoisky.  He left Ukraine in 2007 and moved to London in 2009 where he stayed \nuntil 2017 when he moved to Geneva.  His position was that since the time he left \nUkraine in 2007 he and Mr Kolomoisky had tended towards their own individual \nprojects.  Like Mr Kolomoisky he moved back to Ukraine in 2019.   \n245. There was some documentary material to the effect that the Individual Defendants may \nhave moved apart since 2007, but this was contained in Mr Bogolyubov’s served trial \nwitness statement, on which the Bank was not able to cross -examine him and I cannot \nconclude that what he said  gave a full description of the true position .  In light of their \ndecisions not to give evidence and attend for cross -examination on their witness \nstatements, the court has an incomplete picture of their relationship during the relevant \nperiod and the extent t o which they continued to cooperate, but it is possible to reach \nsome conclusions based on the documents that have been disclosed, the statements of \nother witnesses and the inferences which it is appropriate to draw.  \n246. I have reached the conclusion that, although it is quite possible that there has been a \nshift in the precise nature of the relationship between the Individual Defendants, they \nwere continuing to act in conjunction with each other throughout the period rele vant to \nthese proceedings, most particularly in relation to the assets in which they had both \ninvested alongside each other , including therefore their respective interests in the Bank .  \nThat does not of itself mean that each of them knew everything that th e other one knew \nin relation to the assets which they jointly held, but it does mean that they are likely to \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n64 \n have continued to have regular communication with each other over the entire period \nwith which these proceedings are concerned.  \n247.

The value of those jointly owned assets is very substantial.  On the basis of their own  \nfreezing order asset  disclosure, they both own interests in a large number of the same \nassets, where the size of their holdings taken together ( valued by them at the time of \ntheir asset disclosure  in aggregate at more than US$8 billion) are either the same or \nvery similar – in other words held 50/50.  Many of these holdings give the Individual \nDefendants between them controlling interests in the relevant entity or underlying \nbusiness.  This joint ownership of other  assets is also reflected by the fact that both of \nthem made asset disclosures in these proceedings which listed 201 offshore holding \ncompanies in which each of them held equivalent interests, and through the medium of \nwhich, they each therefore held indirect  interests in underlying assets of approximately \nequal value.  \n248. Whether or not this amounts to “virtually all of their most valuable companies”  (as the \nBank contends but Mr Bogolyubov disputes) is not the core point.  What matters is that, \nby any standards , their jointly owned wealth was very extensive indeed.  What also \nmatter s is that I do not think that the evidence establishes the accuracy of Mr \nBogolyubov’s submission that , while Mr Kolomoisky may have been a micro -manager \nwho was always all over the detail , he was not.  True it is that Mr Kolomoisky was \n“everywher e” (as it was colourfully put in one Skype exchange between employees of \nBOK) , and I accept the submission that the same cannot be said about Mr Bogolyubov.  \nNonetheless, I do not agree that he was not a details man – some of the late disclosure \nrelating to Sunaltezza give s the lie to that .  I accept the Bank’s submission that the \nevidence as a whole , including the way they continued to work together in lockstep \nafter the Bank’s nationalisation,  shows that, while Mr Kolomoisky was obviously the \nlarger perso nality, they were both closely involved with the Bank.  \n249. In the same way that the Individual Defendants were both accustomed to hold their \nequivalent interests in disclosed assets through percentage holdings in the same \noffshore holding companies, they were also both accustomed to use the same nominee \nindividual s to hold other assets pursuant to oral agreements.  Their asset disclosures \nrevealed that one of those individuals was a former employee of the Bank, 21 of them \nwere employees of PBC and eight of them were employees of Primecap.  The relevance \nof PBC and Primecap to these proceedings is a subject to which I will revert shortly . \n250. The Individual Defendants were also close on a more personal level.  There is evidence, \nwhich was not contradicted by either of them, that by the early part of 2017, they had \nshared office facilities in Geneva and both had homes in Nikolskoye.  Although th e \ndocumentary record of the communications they had between each other is clearly \nincomplete, the nature of some of the WhatsApp and other messages which have \nsurvived showed that they were accustomed to share jokes, memes, snippets of gossip, \nbanter, cryp tic comments and even health recommendations, all of a type which \nreflected a close personal relationship.  \n251. In support of its argument that the Individual Defendants have continued to be close, \nboth in their business dealings and personally, the Bank relied on the fact that, although \nthey have been embroiled in litigation as co -defendants for over a decade, they  have \nnever sought to blame each other for what it called their legal woes, no"}

One example \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n65 \n on which the Bank relied was Mr Bogolyubov’s Defence in  the Pinchuk Proceedings .  \nThe Defence was signed by Mr Howard and Mr Haydon who now act for Mr \nKolomoisky in these proceedings, and in that Defence Mr Bogolyubov pleaded that \n“for the purposes of these proceedings only” he would not dispute that he was jointly \nand severally liable with Mr Kolomoisky in relation to the agreements and declarations \nof trust in issue.  Another in which it appears t hat the Individual Defendants cooperated \nto their mutual be nefit was at the interlocutory stages of claims against them both (as \nwell as others) in  the Tatneft Proceedings . \n252. I am not persuaded by the Bank’s submission that this litigation conduct of itself \ndemonstrates that the Individual Defendants had a continuing close affinity which is \ninconsistent with the way in which Mr Bogolyubov advanced his case as having acted \nindep endently of Mr Kolomoisky.  They may have both taken the view that taking a \ndifferent line on points of principle (or even advancing what might colloquially be \ncalled a cut -throat defence) was not in their respective interests, notwithstanding a \nmoving apa rt.  There were also some signs of a divergence of position  during the course  \nof the trial , such as when Ms Montgomery compared what she said was her client’s lack \nof involvement in matters to the obvi ous involvement of Mr Kolomoisky.  \n253. Nonetheless , I have concluded  that the litigation tactics they have adopted are consistent \nwith a close longstanding business and personal relationship in which they have been \naccustomed to operate in conjunction with each other over many years. Furthermore, \nthis becomes more relevant in relation to the contact which it is clear that the Individual \nDefendants had with each other immediately prior to the commencement of these \nproceedings.  There is compelling evidence that in the period immediately prior to \nDecember 2017, the Individual Defendants were in close communication in relation to \nthe steps that they might take to thwart the bringing of any litigation which the Bank \nmight bring against them. Those communications were based on material which Mr \nKolomo isky had received from employees of the Bank, notwithstanding that by that \nstage the interests of the Bank by which those employees were still employed were in \ndirect conflict with those of the Individual Defendants as it s former owners.  \n254. Another important aspect of their relationship was the way in which the Individual \nDefendants communicated with each other.  Mr Kolomoisky has maintained throughout \nthat he does not use e -mail believing it to be unsafe and unreliable and the electronic \nmeans by which he was accustomed to communicate with others, including Mr \nBogolyubov, w ere WhatsApp, Viber and the Black.   The fact that the first three \nnumbers in the January 2013 version of the Black directory were the Dnipro work \nnumbers for Mr Kolomoisky (0101), Mr Bogolyubov (0102) and Mr Dubilet (0103) \ngives some indication of its significance as a communication mechanism between the \nIndividual Defendants as two principal members of the Bank’s Supervisory Board and \nthe chair man of its Management Board.  \n255.

The closeness of this business and personal relationship is a strong pointer that, in the \nabsence of evidence to the contrary, the Individual Defendants are likely to have acted \ntogether in the making and implementation of decisions in relation to the conduct of the \nBank’s affairs , and I so find .  That is not to say that everything one of them knew or did \nwas known or done by the other as well.  However, I am satisfied that , when it came to \nthe Bank’s management taking any steps of relevance to the interest s of the Individual \nDefendants (whether as shareholders of the Bank , or through their indirect  interest s in \nentities  having dealings with the Bank) , each of them will have known what those steps \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n66 \n were , and they will have acted together in authorising those steps and in originating or \nconfirming the instructions that were given.   I accept the Bank’s submission that any \nmaterial involvement of either of them in the planning or implementation of the scheme \nor the Misappropriation is most unlikely to have been carried out without the knowledge \nor approval of the other . \n \nPBC  \n256. I now turn to explain the significance of two entities (PBC and Primecap), which I have \nalready mentioned.  They were not part of the Bank, but in these proceedings they have \nbeen said by the Bank to have been owned and /or controlled by the Individual \nDefendants:  PBC , as a Ukrai ne-based hub for establishing and administering their \nbusinesses and Primecap , as a Cypr us-based equivalent for their offshore businesses.  \n257. PBC was an organisation , incorporated in 2001 under the name Privat Business Centre  \nLLC , which provided services to the Bank’s Investment Business headed by Mr \nNovikov.  The evidence is that those services included the administration of legal \npaperwork, the preparation of corporate documents and registration with the relevant \nstate entities o n behalf of clients of BOK, approximately 50% of which used its services.  \nIts offices were located in the same building (at 32 Naberezhnaya Pobedy, Dnipro) as \nthe Bank ’s Investment Business.   The head of PBC was  Mr Melnyk.  \n258. PBC played a significant role in the subject matter of the Bank’s claim .  It is apparent \nfrom the structure charts (with which I deal in more detail below) that, during the period \nin which the Misappropriation and the Transformation were taking place, its employees \nacted as officers, representatives, shareholders and purported UB Os of all 47 of the \nUkrainian Borrowers and at least 29 of the Intermediary Borrowers.  The structure \ncharts also disclose that all of the individuals said by the Corporate Defendan ts to be \none of the UBO s of the shares in the English Defendants and Ukrtransitservice were \nofficers or employees of PBC: Mr Melnyk, Iurii Pugach, Mr Ivlev, Ms Yesipova and \nIryna Try kulych.  Employees of PBC  were also in regular contact with BOK  throughout \nthe relevant period  regarding the grant of the Relevant Loans and the Intermediary \nLoans, the preparation of the RSAs and the conduct of the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings .   \nSeveral of them (initially 10 and then joined by Mr Ivlev to make 11) were taken on by \nMr Bogolyubov’s company, Sunaltezza, in the period after nationalisation , a matter \nwhich only fully emerged  during the course of the trial (see the findings made in \nparagraphs 162 to 175 above) . \n259. The Bank’s pleaded case was that , where it was alleged that t"}
{"start": 245000, "text": "the grant of the Relevant Loans and the Intermediary \nLoans, the preparation of the RSAs and the conduct of the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings .   \nSeveral of them (initially 10 and then joined by Mr Ivlev to make 11) were taken on by \nMr Bogolyubov’s company, Sunaltezza, in the period after nationalisation , a matter \nwhich only fully emerged  during the course of the trial (see the findings made in \nparagraphs 162 to 175 above) . \n259. The Bank’s pleaded case was that , where it was alleged that the Individual Defendants \ncontrolled the Borrowers or the Intermediary Borrowers , its allegation was to include \ntheir control via PBC  which itself was owned or controlled by them.  It pleaded that the \nofficers and employees of PBC acted on the direct or indirect instructions of the \nIndividual Defendants  in relation  to the affairs of  the Borrowers and Intermediary \nBorrowers , including  by causing them to enter into written agreements and transfer \nfunds; i.e., it is alleged that the Individual Defendants controlled the Borrowers and the \nIntermediary Borrowers through PBC.  It was also the Bank’s case that officers and \nemployees of PBC acted for the Individual Defendants  as nominee  directors  and \nshareholders in relation to the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers  as well as other \nentities . If, as alleged by the Bank, the Individual Defendants (whether separately or \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n67 \n jointly) owned and/or controlled PBC, the role played by its officers and employees in \nthe affairs of the Borrowers and the Intermediary Borrowers is of relevance to the \nquestion of whether the Individual Defendants were involved in the Misappropriation \nto a greater extent t han they have been prepared to admit.  It also strengthens the Bank’s \ncase that the participants in the Misappropriation were all inter -connected with the two \ncommon denominators being the two Individual Defendants.  \n260. The Individual Defendants both deny that they ever controlled PBC or that they ever \ngave instructions to its officers and employees.  Mr Kolomoisky’s case is that PBC was \nalways controlled by  Mr Melnyk and his business partners.   Mr Kolomoisky  also \npleaded that he did not own any part of PBC save for a brief  period b etween September \n2013 and February 2014  during which he was the UBO  of an entity called  Song o LLC  \n(“Songo”) , a registered shareholder , then holding c.25% of  PBC .  He alleges that, \nalthough he therefore had an ownership interest in PBC for a short period of time, he \nhad had no intention to acquire that interest.  He pleaded that he did so because Mr \nMelnyk and his business partners arranged for 100% of Songo to be transferred to \ncompanies held on his beha lf for use as a special purpose vehicle in connection with \nhis participation in the provision to the Bank of US$5.2 million of subordinated debt.  \nHe says that he did not know that Songo then held just under 25% of the shares in PBC, \nfrom which it divested in February 2014  when it disposed of its interest  (which it did \nto Agropromtekhnologiya LLC  (“Agroprom”) , one of the Ukrainian Borrowers , in \nwhich the Individual Defendants both admitted to a minority interest) .  The credibility \nof this part of his case must be assesse d in light of the  fact that he had given earlier asset \ndisclosure at the time of the WFO which showed that at that stage (2018) he owned \n100% of Songo.  \n261. Mr Bogolyubov too denied that he ever had any interest in PBC apart from an indirect \nholding between November 2013 and July 2015 which varied in amount between 3.54% \nand 11.08%.  This interest was said to be held through a chain of nominees including \n(a) four Ukrainian companies (Arkhon LLC, Agroprom, Makros LLC and Mitsar LLC  \n(“Mitsar” )), which held shares in PBC, (b) a Delaware company called Modena \nHolding LLC (“Modena”)  which held shares in the four Ukrainian companies , and ("}

In \nhis Defence, Mr Bogolyubov pleaded that he had  no personal knowledge of the se \nmatters and was not aware at any material time of h is interest in PBC.   In his closing \nsubmis sions, it was said that this appeared to be “a technical interest held as a result of \nthe various complex and changing corporate holding structures put together for” him  \nand that his disclosure of it was inconsistent with attempting to use plausible deniability \nto hide his true connection to PBC . \n262. I agree with the Bank ’s submission that the Individual Defendants’ cases on how they \ncame to hold these but only these interest s, unsupported as they are by any evidence, \nlack credibility.  The extent of the interests which PBC’s registered shareholders held \nin PBC was constantly changing over the course of the period between 2005 and the \nBank’s nationalisa tion, but many of the m had established links to one or both of the \nIndividual Defendants  over periods of time which extended well beyond the periods for \nwhich they admitted that they had the unintended interests in PBC summarised above.   \nThe Bank has produced evidenced schedules of the extent of those links which \ndemonstrates pervasive interconnectivity between the Individual Defendants and what \nappear on any view to be the nominee owners of the ev er-changing  interests in PBC.  It \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n68 \n was sa id that it was an obvious inference that they owned PBC at all times , but that \ntheir ownership was structured in what was said to be the opaque and ever changing \nmanner that they used for many of their other companies , including large numbers of \nthe Borrowers .   \n263. The Bank relie d on a number of other indications that the Individual  Defendants ’ case \nthat they did not  own or control PBC is false.   Two of such  indications might appea r to \nbe minor, but in my view they are properly to be c haracterised as small but  telling.  \ni) The first was that PBC’s former name included the word “Privat” within it, a \nword which the evidence established that everyone in Ukraine regarded as a \nreference to one of the Individual Defendants’ businesses.  It changed its name \nin 2005 , but there is no evidence that it did so in response to a  manageme nt buy -\nout or the like .   I think that there is real substance in the submission that it is \nunrealistic to think that the Individual Defendants would have permitted any \nthird party to conduct a business usi ng that name, more particularly where that \nbusiness entity also occupied part of the same building as the Bank’s Investment \nBusiness.  \nii) Secondly, in 2010, which was long after the change of name, employees of PBC \nwere still being treated as employees of the Privat group , and were described as \n“colleagues” when being given the opportunity, together with employees of the \nBank and Primecap , to vote on a new Primecap group logo.  \n264. A further factor which points to the accuracy of the Bank’s case that PBC was \nultimately owned and /or controlled by  the Individual Defendants was that many officers \nor employees of PBC held very valuable assets for them under arrangements which \nwere oral rather than in writing or, in the case of Mr Bogolyubov, arrangements which \nwere said to have arisen by conduct or implication.

In the case of Mr Bogolyubov , his \nposition  shifted from being one to the effect that the agreements were oral to being one \nwhich  allege d that the arrange ments arose  by conduct or implication , only shortly \nbefore the start of the trial.   The amounts concerned were very substantial.  Mr \nKolomoisky’s asset disclosure identifie d 36 of his Ukrainian assets, in which his \ninterests are valued at c. US$1bn, which are  held via structures involving oral \nagreements with PBC employees.  Mr Bogolyubov’s asset disclosure identified 79 of \nhis Ukrainian assets, in which his interests are valued at c. US$470m, which are held \nin a similar way.  \n265. I accept that the mere fact that employees of PBC acted as nominees for both of the \nIndividual Defendants, does not of itself establish a relationship of ownership or control  \nof PBC , although it is consistent with it.  This is capable of being the case, even though \nthe evidence shows that employees of PBC held at least 14 9 roles as management board, \ncommittee members and other officers of 45 of the Individual Defendants’ assets.  \nHowever, in my view the arrangements in the present case  are powerful indicators that \nthe relationship between each of the Individual Defendants and PBC was more than \nvery close. What makes the Bank’s case more probable is that these relationship s were \nsaid to have been established pursuant to an otherwise unevidenced oral arrangement \nor arrangements that arose by implication.  \n266. Where arrangements in this form are  said to be  in place , it is materially  more  likely that \nthe service provider , whose employees fulfil the role of nominees,  is not a genuine and \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n69 \n independent third party .  It is much more likely that the necessary level of trust and \nreassurance for the ultimate beneficial owner will only be established if the service \nprovider (in this case PBC) is owned or controlled by the person to whom the service \nis provided.   It seems to me that this is particularly likely to be the case in the case of \nMr Bogolyubov, given his position that the arrangement s were not even pursuant to an \noral agreement , but simply arose by implication.  It is very difficult to see  how that \ncould arise in respect of assets worth several hundred million US$ unless the entity \n(PBC) employing the nominees who had undertak en these unspoken obligations was \nitself controlled by the  person for whom the asset is said to be held (Mr Bogolyubov).   \n267. That this was the true nature of this relationship  between the Individual Defendants and \nPBC is  also supported by what happened at the time of the Luchaninov e -mail, a \ndocument which I will come back to later in this judgment.  This e -mail had been sent \nby Mr Luchanino v to Mr Pikush (copied to Mr Yatsenko and Mr Novikov) on 31 March \n2015 .  It suggested, in light of the NBU ’s unscheduled review of 42 of the Borrowers , \nand t aking into account th e risk of the  relevant  loan transactions being linked to  parties \nrelated to the Bank, that 21 directors of the Borrowers, all but one of whom were \nofficers or employees of PBC, should be removed in order to conc eal those connections .  \nAs I shall explain , changes in the PBC nomineeshi ps then occurred, a development \nwhich is unlikely to have  occurred in the way that it did , if PBC had not been controlled \nby the same people who also controlled the entities in respect of which the c"}

So far as Mr Kolomoisky is concerned, his asset disclosure revealed assets in the form \nof percentage interests in dozens of  entities held pursuant to these arrangements through \napproximately 23 employees of PBC acting as nominees (together in some instances \nwith employees of Primecap fulfilling the same function).  As I have said t he value of \nthese assets was substantial  (approximately US$1 billion ) even in the context of this \ncase.  The fact that oral arrangements with a significant number of PBC employees  \nwere all that was required both to reflect the nomineeship and to secure Mr \nKolomoisky’s continuing interest in underlying assets of very substantial value, \ndemonstrated as a minimum that the relationship between him and their employer was \nboth close and habitual.  \n269. So far as Mr Bogolyubov is concerned,  it was pointed out in his written closing \nsubmissions that, despite what was said by the Bank in opening, there is no \ndocumentary evidence which demonstrates that Mr Bogolyubov was giving any \ninstructions to Mr Melnyk in relation to management of PBC over the relevant period.  \nHe accepts that there is evidence of PBC administering what he calls the Scheme, but \nsays that there is no material to evidence his involvement.  I agree that there is nothing \nwhich amounts to dir ect evidence that Mr Bogolyubov had management or control of \nPBC itself, and here as in other contexts, the Bank had a tendency to treat Mr \nBogolyubov as if he was one and the same as Mr Kolomoisky.   \n270. However, there is clear evidence that he was in regular contact with PBC and its \nemployees, sometimes via Mr Novikov, about assets which were held by them on his \nbehalf.  H is asset disclosure revealed that, out of the 109 assets in the form of percentage \ninterests in diverse entities held pursuant to these arrangements, 79 were held in this \nway through approximately 20 employees of PBC acting as nominees (together in some \ninstances with employees of Primecap fulfilling the same function).  The value of thes e \nassets was very substantial as well ( approximately US$479 million ).  The fact that these \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n70 \n very valuable assets were held in this way for Mr Bogolyubov by PBC nominees  and \nthe fact that the inf ormation as to the role of PBC and its employees was only extracted \nfrom him after the application of great pressure by the Bank during the course of \npreparing the case for trial , underpinned a submission by the Bank that the relationship \nbetween these individuals and Mr Bogolyubov was such that everybody knew, without \nhaving to be told, that when they came to be the holder, they held for him . \n271. Leaving aside the question of whether the Individual Defendants owned or controlled \nPBC, but consistently with it, t he Bank relied in its claim more generally on the fact \nthat there is a close association between the individual PBC employees whom the \nIndividual Defendants assert act as nominees for their assets more generally, and the \nindividuals whom the Individual Defendants now assert to be the UBOs of the \nBorrowers and the Corporate Defendants.  Thus the structure and nominee charts which \nI describe in more detail below establish that the vast majority of the individuals said \nby the Individual Defendants to be the UBOs of the Borrowers and four of the Corporate \nDefendants were both employees"}

In my view, the existence of the admitted relationship between the Individual \nDefendants and the PBC nominees, and the means by which those nomineeships had \ncome to be established and continued to be maintained gives rise, in the absence of \nevidence to the  contrary, to a strong inference that similar arrangements were in \nexistence in relation to the holdings by those nominees of interests in the Borrowers \nand the Corporate Defendants.  \n273. Having regard to these and the other considerations described in this section of the \njudgment, I think that the Bank’s explanation  to the effect that  the Individual \nDefendants owned , or at least controlled,  PBC at all material times , but that their \nownership or control was structured in the opaque manner used by them more generally , \nand that they were only driven to admit occasional fractional interests once direct \ndocumentary evidence emerged, is a more likely explanation.   I have also concluded \nthat the B ank has established that the relationship between PBC and both of the \nIndividual Defendants was very much closer than that of a standard service provider \nand client.  In my judgment, PBC was an entity which was at least controlled by the \nIndividual Defendants  in all material respects , although I cannot be certain of the legal \nmechanisms by which that was achieved.  It was used by them to provide, amongst \nother services, employees to act as nominees for them in respect of their interests in \nassets of which t hey were the true UBOs.    \n \nPrimecap  \n274. Primecap  also fulfilled a central role in relation to the Misappropriation and \nsurrounding events.   In particular , it was involved in the administration of the Corporate \nDefendants, including by giving instructions for the execution of RSAs .  It  also \nprocured the ED  Principals  to execute backdated instructions and was involved in the \nadministration of the Cypriot Borrowers .  It gave instructions for  the prepa ration  of \ncorrespondence and agreements between the C orporate Defendants  and the B orrowers \nto show to the Ukrainian court for the purposes of the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings and \nwas involved  in transferring some of t he Individual Defendants ’ assets to the Bank \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n71 \n during the course of the Asset Transfers .  The extent of its role is not in any serious \ndoubt .  As was accepted by Mr Bogolyubov in his written closing submissions , there is \na wealth of evidence that Primecap was involved in the administration of “whatever \nwas in fact going on at the Bank, ‘Scheme’ or otherwise”.  \n275. The Bank  pleaded that , where it allege d that the Individual Defendants  controlled the \nCorporate Defendants or any principals for whom they were acting, this  was to be taken \nas includ ing an allegation that their control was via Primecap which was owned and/or \ncontrolled by them.  It was also the Bank’s case that Primecap’s officers and employees \nacted on the direct or indirect instructions of Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov  in \nrelation to the affairs of those entities, including (without limitation) causing them to \nenter into written agreements; execute other documents such as letters; and transfer \nfunds . \n276.

Both of the Individual Defendants denied that this was the case.  Mr Kolomoisky \npleaded  that, since May 2011 , Primecap had been beneficially owned by its  manage rs.  \nMr Bogolyubov  denied that he controlled the Corporate Defendants or the ED \nPrincipals via Primecap , or at all .  He also denied that the officers or employees of \nPrimecap acted on his direct or indirect instructions in relation to the affairs of the \nCorporate Defendants or the ED Principals.  Mr Bogolyubov reiterated his position in \nclosing , and submitted  there was no evidence that he had, or had exercised , any control \nover Primecap in this regard or at all.   \n277. Primecap was established in July 2010 by a Cypriot lawyer, Andreas Marangos.  Its \npremises were housed on the first floor of a building which was also occupied both by \nthe Limassol office of the Bank’s Cyprus branch and the offices of Marangos & \nHadjipapa LLC (“M&H”) in which  Mr Marangos and his wife, Amalia Hadjipapa, are \nthe partners.  Primecap’s financial statements recorded its principal activities as being \nthe provision of corporate, M&A and other consulting services.  It had more than 40 \nemployees dur ing the period most relevant to these proceedings.  \n278. There is no issue that, for the first six months after its incorporation, all of Primecap’s \nshares were held by Mr Marangos on trust for Mr Kolomoisky.  In January 2011 that \nholding was transferred by Mr Marangos to a Nevis company, Primecap Investments \nLimited, formerly Magot Limited (“Primecap Investments”), the shares in which had \nbeen held by Christoforos Loukaidis (an employee of M&H ) on trust for a BVI entity, \nRalkon Commercial Ltd (“Ralkon”), since 2004.  From April 2009, 50% of the shares \nin Ralkon had been held by Andri Kyriakou (a nominee for Mr Kolomoisky) and 50% \nhad been held for an entity called Marigold Trust Company Ltd (“Marigold”).  Mr \nKolomoisky has pleaded that Marigold was the UBO of this holding.  Mr Bogolyubov \nhas pleaded that , if Marigold  had a temporary interest in Primecap , he was not aware \nof it.  \n279. I do not accept the Individual Defendants’ case in relation to Marigold, its interest in \nRalkon as from April 2009 and its indirect holding of shares in Primecap as from \nJanuary 2011.  In Eclairs Group Ltd  v. JKX Oil and Gas Plc  [2013] EWHC 2631 (Ch) , \n[2014] Bus LR 18  (“Eclai rs Group ”) at [256], Mann J referred to evidence which \npointed to Mr Bogolyubov having acquired a 50% economic interest in Ralkon in April \n2009.  There is also evidence, not gainsaid by Mr Bogolyubov, that Marigold was a \ntrust company  of which Mr Anischenko (Mr Bogolyubov’s personal assistant) is a \ndirector  and which was described by  Mann J in Eclairs Group at [8]  as being “owned \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n72 \n by what is said to be a trus t whose beneficiaries are Mr Bogolyubov and his family” .  It \nis therefore said that i t was him, not Marigold, who was the UBO of these shares.  In \nthe absence of evidence to the contrary from either of the Individual Defendants , I find \nthat the probabilities are that the effect of the January 2011 transfer was that they \n(jointly) then became the UBOs of Primecap.  \n280. Although Mr Bogolyubov has made a bare unsupported assertion that he was unaware \nthat Marigold held 50% of Primecap in the first part of 2011, he has done nothing to \nsubstantiate this part of his case, and I think it is unlikely that he was not aware of th is \nat the time.

If there was substance in his assertions, there would have been an evidenced \nexplanation of what happened to the 50% holding in Ralkon after it was originally \ntransferred to Marigold in 2009 . \n281. On 10 January 2011, at the same time as the shares in Primecap were transferred by Mr \nMarangos to Primecap Investments, the English Defendants executed services \nagreements with Primecap.  The services to be provided by Primecap were all expressed \nin the same terms and extended to corporate governance issues, invoice a nd document \nverification and the preparation and execution of documents on behalf of its client.  The \ntrial bundles also contained unsigned copies of the same forms of agreement made out \nin the  names of the BVI Defendants.  In the period after its incorporation, staff from the \nBank’s Investment Division moved to Cyprus.  From 1 April 2013, Primecap was \nmanaged by Mr Novikov who was remunerated as its “Senior Consultant”.  He was \nalso an employee and officer of the Bank, being first deputy chair  of the Management \nBoard, head of the Investment Business and a member of the ECC which approved the \nRelevant Loans.   I think that Mr Novikov’s role at Primecap, when combined with the \nrole he had at the Ba nk and the close working relationship he had with both of the \nIndividual Defendants , is significant support for the Bank’s case  that Primecap  was then \ncontrolled by the Individual Defendants.  \n282. However, the fact that the Individual Defendants were the beneficial owners of \nPrimecap through Primecap Investments in early 2011 does not of itself mean that they \nwere still the beneficial owners two years later when the Relevant Loans were agreed.  \nIn particular, on 20 May 2011 the shares in Primecap Investments were recorded as \nbeing held by Ms Hadjipapa, and it is p leaded by Mr Kolomoisky that he has had no \nownership interest in Primecap since that date.   The Bank does not deny that Ms \nHadjipapa holds her interest in the shares in Primecap Investments on trust, but it \ndisputes that this indicated any change in the ultimate beneficial ownership in 2011 for \na number of reasons.  \n283. Firstly, it is said that Ms Hadjipapa has acted as a nominee for the Individual Defendants  \nin their other assets ownership structures .  This is established by  Mr Bogolyubov’s own \nasset disclosure, which lists Ms Hadjipapa as the nominee holder of shares in a Nevis \ncompan y (Bexiral Enterprises Ltd) involved in the complex structures through which \nboth Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov hold their interests in one of their jointly held \nassets  (Finance Company Finilon  LLC) .  She also appears in disclosed historic list s of \nMr Kolomoisky’s assets  as the nominee holder of shares in another Nevis company , \nFaracon Holdings L td, which itself is part of the highly complex ownership chain of \nanother of the ir jointly held assets  (PJSC Stakhanovsky Ferroalloy Plant),  their \nrespective interest s in which  is disclosed by both of the Individual Defendants  in their \nasset  disclosure .  She also appears in a disclosed historic list of Mr Bogolyubov’s assets \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n73 \n as the nominee  holder of shares in a dormant Cypriot company  (Lonastro Investments \nLtd).  \n284. Secondly, the documentation which evidences the contention that Primecap employees \nor managers might have acquired some form of interest in Primecap Investments is very \nunsatisfactory.   T"}

She also appears in a disclosed historic list of Mr Bogolyubov’s assets \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n73 \n as the nominee  holder of shares in a dormant Cypriot company  (Lonastro Investments \nLtd).  \n284. Secondly, the documentation which evidences the contention that Primecap employees \nor managers might have acquired some form of interest in Primecap Investments is very \nunsatisfactory.   The Bank submitted that  the only document s which did so were a \nnumber  of trust deeds , almost all of which were dated 11  April 2013 (the date at which \nMr Novikov started to be remunerated as its “Senior Consultant”).  Under these trust \ndeeds, Ms Hadjipapa declared that she held her interests in various blocks of numbere d \nshares in  Primecap Investment s (all of which were less than 10%) on trust for twelve \nnamed Primecap employees.   It was submitted by the Bank that t his documentation is \ninconsistent with the case advanced by Mr Kolomoisky, because all of the deeds of trust \nwere executed just under two years or more after the time at which Mr Kolomoisky \nasserted that Ms Hadjipapa had taken a transfer of the shares for them to be held on \ntrust for the employees.  \n285. It was also said  by the Bank that an analysis of the percentage holdings and the dates \non which the trust deeds were entered into demonstrates that much the most probable \nexplanation for them being introduced was in an effort to substantiate an argument that \nPrimecap was not a related  party to the Bank.  The issue of related parties arose in a \nnumber of different contexts during the course of the proceedings, but  the Bank pointed \nout that  Primecap was listed in PwC’s IFRS list of related parties as at 31 De cember \n2011 and 31 December 2012 on the basis that it fell into the category of “Companies \nunder common control and other related legal entities” and as a related person on the \nBank’s Insider List as of 1 April 2013 (drawn up in accordance with NBU Resolut ion \nNo 368).  It was only between 1 April 2013 and 1 July 2013 that Primecap was excluded \nfrom that list on the grounds that “Due to the change of participants - there are no signs \nof connectedness”.  \n286. Counsel for Mr Bogolyubov relied on a quite different  set of eleven trust deeds signed \nby Ms Hadjipapa , all dated 1 June 2011 , i.e., contemporaneously with the time at which \nMr Kolomoisky pleaded that he no longer had an interest in  Prim ecap. They all \npurported to declar e trusts of the  same shares  in Primecap Investm ents for almost \nexactly the same group of employees .  However, the groups of identification numbers \nfor the shares attributable to each Primecap employee were dif ferent from the 2013  \ndeeds , as were the number of share s held by each of them.  There is no obvious \nexplanation for this discrepancy , but more importantl y, there is no explanation as to  \nwhy it was only after 1 April 2013 , when the deeds referred to in the  Bank ’s closing \nsubmissions  had been executed , that Primecap was removed from the NBU list of \nrelated parties.  If the 1 June 2011 deeds genuinely reflected the person s for whom the \nshares in Primecap  Investments were held  by Ms Hadjipap a, Primecap  would not have \nbeen included on the related party lists after June 2011, nor would it have been recorded \nthat it was only excluded from the Re solution 368 list “due to the change of \npartic ipants ” during the period 1 April 2013 and 1 July 2013.  \n287. Thirdly, the only explanation for beneficial ownership in the whole of Primecap’s share \ncapital being transferred to its employees is that there was some form of management \nbuy-out.  However, there is no documentary or other evidence to demonstrate that is  \nwhat happened.

However, there is no documentary or other evidence to demonstrate that is  \nwhat happened.  There is also no evidence to show that the twelve employees who were \nsaid by Mr Kolomoisky to have become the UBOs of Primecap in 2011 received any \ndividends or other distribution s in return for their interest throughout the period of the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n74 \n Misappropriation alleged by the Bank.  Rather, the evidence disclosed that the only \ndistribution was the issue to Mr Novikov of 1,000 redeemable preference shares as late \nas 14 November 2017, which entitled him to an annual dividend of €1.2 million in \npriority to the ordinary shareholders.  This was broadly equivalent to Primecap’s annual \nprofit for each of the 2013 to 2016 financial years.  If the other eleven employees were \nreally the beneficial owners of 90%+ of Primecap’s ordinary shares, it is difficul t to \nunderstand why they would have agreed to its distributable profits being treated in this \nway.  \n288. Fourthly, there is some, albeit limited, evidence that both of the Individual Defendants \ncontinued to be closely involved in the affairs of Primecap right up until the time of the \nBank’s nationalisation.  The two examples to which my attention was specific ally \ndrawn occurred on dates in October and December 2016.  \ni) The first was a 20 October 2016 request made to  Mr Kolomoisky by Svetlana \nMelnikova in the Bank’s budgeting department (herself acting at the request of \nMr Novikov) to authorise payment of amongst other matters Primecap tax and \nsocial insurance; an author isation  which he gave  without qualification.  In my \nview , the Bank was entitled to submit that he would have questioned this , if he \nwas being asked to authorise payment of the tax and social security for a \ncompany he had in fact sold five years earlier.  \nii) The second was an e -mail exchange on 20 December 2016 in which Mr \nBogolyubov told Mr Anischenko that Ms Markova had been moved from the \nBank’s Cyprus branch (which he said was “done”) to Primecap within two days \nof the Bank’s nationalisation, and in that capacity would be able to help with a \nrelated parties fund transfer enquiry.  \n289. This second example mirrored the fact that, immediately after the Bank’s \nnationalisation, eleven members of staff relocated from PBC in Dnipro to Cyprus , i.e. \nPrimecap .  These included one (Olena Kravchenko) who was said by the Defendants to \nhave been a UBO of 27 Borrowers and 15 Intermediary Borrowers and another  (Vadym  \nPereviznyi) who was said to have been a UBO of 28 Borrowers and 11 Intermediary \nBorrowers.  The inference that this occurred because they were loyal to the Individual \nDefendants  is very str ong. \n290. In my judgment this evidence taken as a whole gives substantial support to the Bank’s \ncase that the UBOs of Primecap have throughout been the Individual Defendants.  In \ncircumstances in which neither of the Defendants was prepared to give evidence on \nwhich  they might have been cross -examined to support their denial that they were, I \nhave reached the conclusion that such evidence as is available points to a  clear  finding  \nthat they were.   In short, t he position is similar to  that which pertained at PBC .  The \nBank has established that the relationship between Prim ecap and both of the Individual \nDefendants goes well beyond that of a service provider and client.  In my judgment, \nPrimecap  was an entity which was controlled by the Individual Defendants , acted on \ntheir instructions  and was used by them to provide, amongst other services, employees \nto act as nominees for them in  respect o f their interests in  assets of which"}

Apart from Primecap, there were a number of other Cypriot entities which were \ninvolved in the transactions that are the subject matter of these proceedings.  \nCollectively, the Bank referred to them as the Cypriot CSPs or corporate service \nproviders.  The most significant was M&H , which had offices in the same building in \nLimassol as Primecap and the Bank’s Cyprus branch.  The two eponymous partners \nwere directors of a number of the Individual Defendants’ companies and Mr Marangos \nwas a director of Collyer.  Both of them were also directors of Sim Lim Trust Company  \n(“Sim Lim”) , the corporate trustee of a number of Mr Bogolyubov’s trusts which had \noriginally been established in Jersey but had been moved to Cyprus in or before early \n2016.   The closeness of the firm’s relationship with the Individual Defendants was \nillustrated by  the fact that Mr Marangos had his own extension on the Black.  There \nwas also evidence that Mr Bogolyubov’s personal assistant was in regular contact with \nMr Marangos, communicating wit h him by WhatsApp on numerous occasions through \nthe period relevant to these proceedings, while the tone of some of the direct \ncommunications between Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Marangos demonstrated a close \npersonal relationship.  \n292. The other Cypriot CSPs were Andreas M Sofocleous & Co Ltd  (“Sofocleous”) for \nwhom Mr Marangos worked before founding M&H, Michalis Tsit sekkos & Associates , \nKyriakides, Sav vides & Associates and SK Law (Symeou & Konnaris), each of whom \neither provided directors or nominee shareholders to companies involved in the \nMisappropriation.  This included the offshore companies which themselves held \ninterest s in the Borrowers and the Intermediary Borrowers.  \n293. It is not said by the Bank that the Cypriot CSPs were controlled by the Individual \nDefendants in any corporate sense.  It is, however, the Bank’s case that, like PBC and \nPrimecap, the Cypriot CSPs provided employees to act as nominees for the Individu al \nDefendants  in relation to a wide range of their assets  and that they were involved in the \noperation of the Misappropriation in their role as nominees for a number of the \nparticipating Borrowers and Intermedi ary Borrowers .  It is then said that their role as \nservice providers and that of their employees as nominees for the Individual \nDefendants’ admitted assets gives rise to a strong inference that  interests in the \nBorrowers and Intermediary Borrowers held by the same nominees were also held for \none or both of the Individual Defendants.  I agree that, in the absence of  evidence to the \ncontrary which could have (but has not) been adduced by the Individual Defendants, \nthis is the correct inference to draw.  \n \nIntroduction to t he Misappropriation  and the forensic accounting experts  \n294.

In navigating this material , I was assisted by detailed statements of fact s (“SOFs”)  \nprepared by the Bank , which the parties all  accepted accurately reflected the documents \non the basis of which they were prepared.  These SOFs recorded financial and corporate \ninformation in relation to each of the Borrowers  and Intermediary Borrowers  (together \nwith the Relevant Loans and  the Intermediary Loans ) drawn f rom client questionnaires, \nfinancial statements, business plans, loan application s, intended use certificates , \nminutes of meetings  and loan agreements . \n296. The Bank  also produce d SOFs in relation to : \ni) the Corporate Defendants , includ ing information in relation to the RSAs, the \nLFSA s and the LFSA Pledges , drawn from the agreements themselves and  \ndocumentation relating to the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings ; \nii) the Share Pledges , draw n from the pledge agreements  themselves together with \ndocumentation relating to their amendment and registration; and  \niii) the New Borrowers  and the New Loans drawn from client questionnaires, \nfinancial statements, business plans, loan applications, intended use certificates, \nminutes of meetings , loan agreements  and surety agreements purporting to \nrecord New Borrower guarantees of the lending to the Borrowers, the \nIntermediary Borrowers and others . \n297. Even though many of these documents may not accurately reflect the true nature of the \ntransactions which they purport to evidence, the SOFs have been a useful means of \ncollating the information disclosed by the Bank’s own records.  \n298. Before explaining my findings of what ac tually occurred, much of which is not in \ndispute, it is important to focus on the elements of the Bank’s claim  under Article 1166 .  \nIn particular : what is the harm said to have been caused to the Bank’s property by the  \nunlawful decisions, act s and omissions of the Defendants  and what is the amount of the \ncompensation to which the Bank is entitled by reason of the harm it was caused ?  The \nway it is pleaded in the Bank’s statement of case is that the Defendants’ unlawfu l acts \ncaused the misappropriation of US$1,911,877,385 of the Bank’s funds through steps \ntaken between April 2013 and September 2014 .  These steps were  said by the Bank to \nhave been procured by the Individual Defendants who were the ultimate beneficiaries  \nof the Misappropriation . \n299. The first step in the Misappropriation  was the agreement of the Relevant Loan s.  The \nnext step was said to be the making of the Relevant Drawdowns which caused the Bank  \nharm totalling US$2,335,943,519 .  It was then said that a portion of the  drawdowns \nunder the Relevant Loans “caused the Unreturned Prepayments ”.  What was meant by \nthis was that applying the Bank’s causation methodology , the Bank’s transaction \nrecords demonstrated that a proportion of the Relevant Drawdowns was used to make \nor fund prepaymen ts to the Corporate Defendants under the RSAs .  I shall explain what \nhappened in more detail in  the section of this judgment which explains the Relevant \nDrawdowns.  \n300. In the event nothing was ever suppl ied under the RSAs  and a net balance (totalling \nUS$1,911,877,385) , being  a proportion of the prepayments, was never returned .

There was a different structure in relation to the Relevant Loans to Prominmet and the \nCypriot Borrowers,  none of wh ich execute d RSAs .  Nonetheless, i t was the Bank’s case \nthat Relevant Drawdowns made under Relevant Loans of which each of them was a \nBorrower  in part  funded the making of two of the Unreturned Prepayments:  \ni) a Relevant L oan to Prominmet dated 20 September 2013 enabled a UAH 157 \nmillion (equivalent to US$18,190,455) Relevant Drawdown to be made on 14 \nFebruary 2014 , which caused the making of part of an Unreturned Prepayment \nby Foxar LLC  (“Foxar”)  to Collyer in the amount of US$17,252, 433 on 19 \nAugust 2014; and  \nii) three Relevant L oans to the Cypriot Borrowers each dated 3 March 2014 \nenabled the making  of Relevant Drawdowns totalling US$118 million , which  \ncaused the making of part of an Unreturned Prepayment by Alfatrader LLC \n(“Alfatrader”) to Collyer in the amount of US$28,770,600 on 11 June 2014 . \n302. It was  then pleaded that worthless security for repayment of the Relevant Loans was \nput in place .  None of th is security  was intended to create enforceable commercial \nobligations  and all of the documents  were shams and/or otherwise contrary to Ukrainian \npublic policy.  \n303. The Bank’s case is that the  consequence of this is that, as a matter of Ukrainian law , the \nBank sustained harm  for the purposes of Article 1166  at the time that the funds forming \npart of the Relevant Drawdowns were transferred to the Borrowers , at which point its \ncause of action was complete .  Mr Kolomoisky accepted in his Defence that, as a matter \nof principle,  harm for the purposes of Article 1166 can, in appropriate cases, encompass \nthe transfer of a claimant’s funds to a third party , and f or his part, Mr Kolomois ky’s \nexpert on Uk rainian law , Mr Oleg Alyoshin, put the point in this way:  \n“… if the defendant commits a wrongful act which entails a deprivation of property  \n(such as a crime of fraud or misappropriation), harm is caused at the time when the \nclaimant is deprived of its property or when the defendant obtains the claimant’s \nproperty, depending on what makes the act  in question unlawful.  Also in this \nsituation , damages can only be awarded to compensate the claimant for its actual \nloss: no damages will be awarded in respect of harm which has already been \nremedied by the time the court  gives its judgment .” \n304. The Individual Defendants ’ principal answer to this is that  the Relevant Drawdowns \nwere in fact repaid to the Bank from  a combination of th ree separate sources , with the \nconsequence that any claim against them in tort by the Bank  has been discharged .  The \nfirst source was the  Intermediary Loans  which repaid the Relevant Loans , the second \nsource was  the proceeds of the Asset Transfers and the third source was the making of \nNew Loans at the time of the Transformation.  \n305. To assist in analysing the causal link between the Relevant Drawdowns  said to have \nbeen  caused by unlawful acts of the Defendants and the losses said to  have been \nsustained  as a result of the harm which they caused , the court (Sir Anthony Mann at the \nfirst CMC) gave permission for the parties to adduce expert evidence from forensic \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Ba"}

To assist in analysing the causal link between the Relevant Drawdowns  said to have \nbeen  caused by unlawful acts of the Defendants and the losses said to  have been \nsustained  as a result of the harm which they caused , the court (Sir Anthony Mann at the \nfirst CMC) gave permission for the parties to adduce expert evidence from forensic \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n78 \n accountants.  The way in which the court identified the issues it was intended to address \nwas first the accuracy and completeness of the Bank’s causation analysis, secondly the \naccuracy and completeness of Mr Kolomoisky’s tracing exercise (which at that st age \nwas based on the Lafferty Spreadsheets) and thirdly the loss alleged to have been \nsuffered by the Bank.  \n306. The Bank instructed Mr Ian Thompson , a Senior Managing Director in FTI Consulting.  \nMr Kolomoisky instructed Mr Jeffrey Davidson, managing director of Honeycomb \nForensic Accounting.  Mr Bogolyubov instructed Mr Luke Steadman, a partner in \nAlvarez & Marsal Disputes and Investigations LLP.  Th e Corporate Defendants did not \ninstruct an expert in forensic accounting.  The principal differences of view were as \nbetween Mr Thompson and Mr Davidson, but in large part the reason for this was that \nMr Steadman’s evidence was l imited by a direction given by Sir Anthony Mann to any \nadditional matters he wished to raise in light of his review of Mr Davidson’s report.  \n307. In carrying out their work, the experts applied two very different approaches.  Mr \nThompson  adopted what can accuratel y be called a  transactional data -based \nmethodology .  This involved taki ng the Relevant Drawdowns, the number and value of \nwhich were not in dispute (270 totalling US$2,355,943,519), and then, having regard \nto the supply agreement references in the Bank’s transactional data, to link prepayments \nand returns of prepayment s in order to quantify the extent to which those Relevant \nDrawdowns were t hemselves repaid by further Relevant Drawdowns.  He calculated \nthat a total of US$384,214,201 was repaid in this manner .  He therefore established \nthat, after allowing for those forms of repayment, the net total of Relevant Drawdowns \nwas US$1,951,729,318.  This was about US$40 million more than the net figure for \nUnreturned Prepayments  (US$1,911,877,385).  Mr Thompson’s arithmetic, reflecting \nthe payment links recorded as such in the Bank’s transactional data, was not in issue \nbetween the parties.  It was a lso common ground that , applying this methodology , the \nBank’s transactional data showed the Relevant Drawdowns as being the source of the \nUnreturned Prepayments.  \n308. Mr Davidson adopted a different methodology , which can more accurately be described \nas a tracing exercise, having not been instructed to address the Bank’s causation \nanalysis.  The way that he described the exercise he was instructed to carry out was \nonly to consider, by reference to the Bank’ s transactional data, its analysis of Relevant \nLoans.   His tracing exercise was different to the way in which the Defendants had \npreviously advanced their case based on the Lafferty Spreadsheets and amounted to \nwhat ca n be called a funds flow methodology, or as explained by Mr Thompson: “a \ncash tracing methodology by which cash inflows to an account are matched to cash \noutflows, either individually or in aggregate, such that the inflow s are traced into the \noutflow s which match the quantum (in US $ or UAH) of the inflow” . \n309. Mr Thompson was criticised in Mr Bogolyubov’s closing submissions as being a \nglorified calculator for the Bank, who permitted himself to be constrained by his \ninstructions and limited himself to applying the Bank’s methodology in order to connect \nthe 270 R elevant Drawdowns to the 82 Unreturned Prepayments.

It was also pointed \nout that he had been criticised for taking what was characterised in Kazakhstan Kagazy  \nv. Zhunus  [2017] EWHC 3374  (Comm) as too restrictive an approach, which meant \nthat his evidence had not looked at the broader picture and as a result was both flawed \nand unhelpful.  It was suggested that his evidence in the present case suffered from the \nsame flaws.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n79 \n 310. I do not think that this criticism was justified.  Mr Thompson made very clear in his \nreports that the exercise he carried out was to apply the Bank’s methodology to establish \nthe accuracy of its case on the extent to which Unreturned Prepayments were fund ed \nby Relevant Drawdowns.  To do so, he used a process of linking payments in the \ntransaction narrative to the supply agreement reference in the transaction narrative.  He \nalso considered the tracing exercise which was advanced by the Individual Defendants , \nwhich came to involve a process which was described as Exact Matching, and pointed \nout the many significant omissions in the form which it originally took.  \n311. At the time of their reports, each of the experts was a fellow of the Institute of Chartered \nAccountants  of England and Wales (“ICAEW”) .  During the course of July 2023, after \nthe trial had commenced but before he was called to give evidence, it came to the \nattention of the Bank’s solicitors that Mr Davidson’s status as a member of the ICAEW  \nwas now recorded as Ceased with a sub -status recorded as Cessated.  They wrote to Mr \nKolomoisky’s solicitors drawing attention to the cessation and attaching a copy of his \ndisciplinary record which disclosed that he had been the subject of a severe reprimand \nin relation to two disciplinary matters in respect of which there had been hearings on 8 \nMarch 2023.  None of this information had been disclosed by Mr Davidson eith er to \nthe Bank or to the court.  \n312. Mr Davidson’s explanation for what had occurred was eventually revealed on 29 \nSeptember 2023, five days before he was due to give evidence on the recommencement \nof the trial after the long vacation.  He made a witness statement, describing it as being \nin anticipation of questions he expected to be asked in cross -examination.  He disclosed \nthat he had been the subject of two complaints in June and August 2021 in respect of \nwhich no disciplinary proceedings had been initiated against him, and that the matter \nin which he had been severely reprimanded was a failure to provide the ICAEW with \nresponses to those complaints.  He also disclosed that the Charity Commission had \nremoved him as trustee of two charities and that those charities had been the subject of \nstatutory enquiries by the Charity Commission.  In his witness statement, Mr Davidson \nalso gave notice that he would rely on his privilege against self -incrimination to justify \nhis refusal to answer any questions about the August 2021 complaint to the ICAEW \nand the Charity Commission inquiry.  \n313. In light of the position adopted by Mr Davidson, it was not possible for the court to \nobtain a full picture of what had occurred or the extent to which the matters in respect \nof which he had been investigated or criticised might have been relevant to the q uality \nof his evidence.  However, he accepted in cross -examination that there was no excuse \nfor his failure to provide the information sought by the ICAEW disciplinary committee"}

However, he accepted in cross -examination that there was no excuse \nfor his failure to provide the information sought by the ICAEW disciplinary committee \n(although he did not accept that his conduct amounted to a deliberate breach o f the \nrules) . \n314. In my view, where an expert presents his evidence as a member of a professional \norganisation , which is expected by him to give the court assurance as to his ability to \nact in the case , he is under a duty to inform the court if his membership has ceased, \nmore particularly where the cessation is linked to disciplinary proceedings against him.  \nMr Davidson accepted in cross -examination that he knew that his presentation as a \nmember of the ICAEW would give the court that assurance, but he had no explanation \nas to why he did not voluntarily inform the court or the Bank of the fact that he had \nceased to be a member with effect from 19 April 2023.

It seems to me that this is a particularly \nsignificant failing when taken together with the fact that Mr  Davidson also failed to \ndisclose that he had been the subject of a finding in another case that his opini on was \nbased on wholly unsupported and fanciful assumptions, which ignored the objective \nfacts and undermined his credibility as an independent expert (per Leggatt LJ in Al \nNehayan  v. Kent  [2018] EWHC 333 (Comm) at [195]).  \n \nThe Relevant Loans  \n315. Between 3 April 2013 and 21 August 2014, the Bank agreed to enter into the Relevant \nLoans by approving and  executing what appeared to be  134 loan agreements with the \n50 Borrowers .  Each Relevant Loan was expressed  to take the form of a n agreement for \na revolving credit facility  for varying amounts, with a currency expressed in either UAH \nor US$.  \n316. The Relevant Loans to the 47 Ukrainian Borrowers were denominated in both UAH \nand US$ .  They varied in amount between UAH 31 million and UAH 600 million (when \ndenominated in UAH) and between US$5 million and US$57 million (when \ndenominated in US$ ).  Each of the Relevant Loans to the three Cypriot Borrowers was \ndenominated in US$ and had a value of between US$14.5 million and US$59.5 million . \nThe Relevant Loans to the Ukrainian Borrowers were advanced for a period of between \neleven  months and five years. The initial period for the advance of the Relevant Loans \nto the three Cypriot Borrowers was three days.  \n317. The circumstances in which the Relevant Loans were granted , and the surviving  internal \ndocumentation relating to th em, give  many indications that, although described as loan \nagreements, the Relevant Loans were not agreed as proper and genuine bank lending \nintended to be advanced or repaid on ordinary commercial terms.  I have already \nexplained that none of the Defendants has m ade a positive case as to how the sums \ndrawn down under the Relevant Loans  can be said to have been made for legitimate \ncommercial pu rposes (or that the RSAs were genuine supply agreements).

I will revert to the legal consequences of that conclusion when I have \nfinished describing the remainder of what occurred.  \n318. The proposals for all but four of the Relevant Loans originated from and had their risk \nprofile assessed by BOK, described as the initiating unit.  Of the four which were not \ninitiated in BOK, the three Relevant Loans to the three Cypriot Borrowers  were listed \nas initiated in the Investment Business and one ( the Relevant Loan to Prominmet) is \nlisted as having originated from or been initiated in the “loan experts department” or \nthe “credit analysts department”.   In fact , where correspondence  has survived , it appears \nthat what happened was that the Relevant Loans to the Ukrainian Borrowers were \ninitiated  after a discussion or other communication between employees of PBC and \nemployees of the Bank within BOK.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n81 \n 319. The process in relation to the Relevant Loans to the Cypriot Borrowers was slightly \ndifferent  from those to the Ukrainian Borrowers .  They were initiated by an individual \nfrom Primecap  making a request to the Bank’s Cypr us branch to prepare the necessary \ndocumentation.   The Bank’s employees then prepared the relevant documents for \nsignature .  It is clear from the way in which this was done that the documentation  was \nnot in place at the time the Relevant Drawdowns were made , but the  loan agreements  \nwere then backdated to give the impression that they had been.  The Bank said that the \napplication forms were actually completed within  the Bank itself .  I do not think that \nthe evidence adduce d by the Bank  establishes that they were actually filled in by \nofficers in the Bank’s Cypriot branch , but it is clear that the process of putting the \ndocumentation in place was mere formalism and there was never any doubt that , once \nrequested by Primecap, the loans would be made available and the moneys would be \ndrawn down without any further substantive scrutiny being applied . \n320. Each of the Relevant Loans was recorded as having been approved by the ECC at \nmeetings the minutes of which were signed by Mr Dubilet  and the large majority of \nwhich were attended by Mr Novikov (127) and Ms Gurieva (129) .  Also present at most \nof what were recorded as approval meetings were Ms Chmona (126), Mr Yatsenko \n(129), Mr Pikush (129) , Mr Kandaurov  (123) , Mr Kryzhanovskiy  (127) and Mr \nGorokhovsk y (129)  together with  a number of more junio r employees who were  \nunlikely to have taken a line which cut ac ross proposals made by Mr Dubilet, Mr \nNovikov or Ms Gurieva .  Of those , Gennadiy Linski y, head of the Bank’s financial and \nrisk department responsible for monitoring the Bank’s financial ratios and capital both \npre- and post -nationalisation, approved 128 of the Relevant Loans in his capacity as a \nmember of the ECC.  Each of the loan agreements was signed on behalf of the Bank \neither by Mr Dubilet who signed 115 or by another member of the Bank’s senior \nmanagement: Mr Pikush who signed 15, Vladislav Morgachov (the general manager of \nthe Bank’s Cyprus branch) who signed  the three Relevant Loans  to the three Cypriot \nBorrowers and Mr Yatsenko who signed one.

At the relevant meetings the members \nrecorded as being present normally included the other members of the Management \nBoard, who also had small holdings of shares in the Bank as described in paragraph 198 \nabove.  \n321. To the extent that any loan made by the Bank exceeded US$2 million , the  credit \ncommittee regulations required it to be approved by the Supervisory Board.  The \nCharter made similar provision if and to the extent that any loan exceeded US$500,000 \nand amounted to related party lending.  None of the Relevant Loans was so authorised , \neven though all of them exceeded US$2 million  (the lowest in value  was c.US$3.7 \nmillion) .  The Bank submitted that this reflected a recognition by the Individual \nDefendants who wer e member s of the Supervisory Board that they needed to distance \nthemselves from the Relevant Loan approval decisio n-making as recorded in the Bank’s \nbooks and records .  What i t also shows is that the nature of what was being done was \nsuch that the employees of the Bank who were involved in their approval and \npreparation either did not regard the  Relevant Loans  as genuine lending to which the \nCharter’s  limits should be applied or they assumed that  (whether generically o r \nspecifically) the Supervisory Board approved what was being done.   The latter seems \nto me to be a likely explanation , although I also think it is probable that it was apparent \nto all those  involved at a higher than purely administrat ive level within the Bank  that \nthe Relevant Loans were not in fact agreed for the purposes for which they purported \nto be made.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n82 \n 322. It is clear  that such material as there is amounted to inadequate evidence on which any \nbank could properly have based a conclusion that the Borrowers were a sensible credit \nrisk.  In part this is demonstrated by the absence of documentation .  Thus, an analysis \nof the SOFs confirms that, in relation to 36 of the 47 Ukrainian Borrowers , no \ninformation was recorded as to their past trading or credit history and, in relation to the \nremaining 11, the only information related to other loans made by the Bank.  On ly one \nof the three Cypriot Borrowers (Fiastra) disclosed any credit history , and that simply \ntook the form of a previous loan from the Bank.  \n323. However, there were many other aspects of the information that was held or retained \nby the Bank which illustrated both the Borrowers’ lack of substance  and that the \napproval process conducted by the ECC was little more than a rubber -stamping exercise  \nwith several evidenced examples of failures to comply with the Bank’s own Lending \nProcedures Manual . \n324. As to the nature of the approval process nearly all of the Relevant L oans were recorded \nas having been a pproved within two business days of the loan being initiated , and \nsometimes even quicker.  Given their size , it is difficult to see how they could have \nbeen subjected to any proper analysis or feasibility assessment  in such a short period of \ntime, or how the members of the ECC could have had sufficient opportunity to consider \nthe relevant materials by reference to the purported cr iteria that appeared to be required \nfrom the face of the documents.

After an exchange to establish \nwhether or not Saltiz could be lent to, t he expert analysis is recorded as having been \ncarried out on the same day (2 December 2013) as the request for the loan was made .  \nThe Relevant Loans are then recorded as having been approved  by the same eleven  \nmembers of the ECC on the same day (in part) and in part two days later on  4 December \n2013 .  Another is Uniks LLC (“Uniks”) where a US$3 6.8 million loan was proposed \nby Tamara Travkina at BOK to Kostiantyn Barsuk at PBC  on 28 July 2014.  It was then \nsigned on the following day, apparently because Mr Dubilet  was then going to be away . \n326. As to the Borrowers ’ lack of substance, n early all of the m were recorded as having had  \na single employee, save for seven which had two employees and one for which the Bank \nhad recorded no employee information.  Furthermore, of the 48 Borrowers in respect \nof which financial statements have been discovered in the Bank’s records, 31 appeared \nfrom those statements to have been balance sheet insolvent at all times, nine were \nrecorded as having been balance sheet insolvent in one or more trading periods and \neight  of the remaining ten had recorded net losses in some or all of the periods to which \nthe statements related .  The agreements provided for each of the Relevant Loans to be \nadvanced at an interest rate of between 10.3% and 12%, with the Relevant Loans to the \nthree Cypriot Borrowers bearing interest at 11%.  This was well below the level s of \nbetween 19% and 19.5% at which the Bank itself was able to borrow from the NBU \nbetween February and May  2014 .  Although the rates on two of these fo ur refinancing \nloans we re reduced to 14.25% in June 2014, the other two remained at 19% and these \ninterest rates taken as a whole were  a further  indication that genuine commercial \nlending was not the purpose of the Relevant Loans.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n83 \n 327. As to  the purpose for which each of the Relevant Loans was advanced the Bank’s \nrecording was remarkably non -specific .  In many instances it was said to be “financing \nof the company’s current activities” or “working capital replenishment” with the source \nof repayment recorded as the Borrowers ’ “main activity”, which itself was identified as \n“non -specialised wholesale trade” or “other wholesale trade”.  On a few occasions \ndifferent language was used to describe the relevant Borrower’s main business activity, \nthe financing of which was said to be the purpose of the loan, but it was almost always \nexpressed in generic terms.  In relation to some but not all of the Relevant Loans, the \nBank’s records contained business plans, but it was invariably the case that, wh ere they \nwere provided, the estimated sales revenue  looking forward  bore little relationship to \nthe historic position or was not recorded at all.  \n328. I was taken to two examples during the course of the trial and  have since  looked at the \nunderlying documentation referred to in the SOFs relating to many others.

The majority \nof the proposals (105 out of 134 ) were categorised as level II (on a scale of I to IV) viz., \nmoderate risk .  I agree with the Bank’s submission that this  risk categorisation cannot \nproperly have reflected the reality of the true nature of what was proposed , and is a \nclear indication that no genuine  scrutiny was carried  out as part of any proper form of \napproval process .  The Relevant Loans to the two Borrowers to which my attention was \nspecifically  drawn, well -illustrate s the point , but the types of deficiency I shall describe \nwas more widely applicable . \n329. The first related to a Ukrainian Borrower , Esmola  LLC  (“Esmola”) , which was granted \ntwo Relevant Loans on 12 February 2014 for UAH  180 million and on 19 February \n2014 for UAH  320 million .  The purpose of the loan s was said to be “financing of the \ncompany’s current activities” and the s ource of repayment was variously described but \nthere was no more detailed description or analysis than “ future revenue from \ncommercial activities” .  Esmola’s financial statements for the period ended 31 \nDecember 2013 showed as sets of UAH 19,700, revenue of UAH 10,00 0 and t he \ntechnical and feasibility study (or “business plan”) anticipated substantial liquid assets \nat the end of each of the succeeding three years based on estimated sales revenue for \nthose years of UAH 295 million, UAH 347 million and UAH 377 million, but there is \nno explanation of how that was to be achieved .  With anticipated revenue increases of \n30,000 times higher or more, and no explanation of how that was to be achieved, i t is \nimpossible to see how this prop osal can have been thought to be a proper or genuine \nloan proposal.   Nonetheless,  the quality of  both loans w as categorised  as “II (moderate \nrisk)”. \n330. The second related to Vegatorg LLC  (“Vegatorg”) which was granted a single Relevant \nLoan  on 15 October 2013  for UAH 54 million .  The purpose of the loan was said to be \n“financing of the company’s current activities”  and the source of repayment was \nvariously described but in general terms:  “revenue from commercial activities” and \n“available working capital” .  Vegatorg ’s financial statements for the period ended 31 \nDecember 2013 showed an excess of liabilities over assets , revenue  and other income  \nof UAH 28,300 and a net loss of UAH 650,700  (after a small net profit in the previous \nperiod) .  The technical and feasibility study anticipated substantial liquid assets of UAH \n1.797 billion  at the end of the relevant period  on the basis of estimate d sales revenue of \nover UAH 3 billion .   This too show ed an  anticipated increase in revenue by a multiplier \nof many tens of thousands, but again the Bank’s records disclosed  no detailed \nexplanation of how that extraordinary result was to be achieved.   It is impossible to see \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n84 \n how this proposal (like the proposal apparently made by Esmola) can have been thought \nto be a proper or genuine loan proposal.  Nonetheless, like the loan to Esmola, the \nquality of this loan  was also categorised as “II (moderate risk)”.  \n331. The Bank also relied on the number of occasions on which the recorded expert analyses \nrelating to Borrowers and Relevant Loans were inconsistent with other information  in \nrelation to the same Borrower .  It made written submissions on a  particular example \nrelating to the Relevant Loan  application  for Agropro m agreed on 19 February 2014 \n(UAH 100 million) and 20 February 2014 (UAH 390 million).

It was said that the \nassets of UAH 124.9 million disclosed in the expert analysis was inconsistent with the \ntechnical and economic feasibility study which indicated that it had liquid  assets of \nUAH 555.5 million.  On the face of it , that is a misreading of the SOF because UAH \n555.5 million was a forward -looking figure .  Nonetheless, t his Borrower ’s financial \nstatements for the pre vious period disclosed that it was  balance sheet insolvent , had no \noperating revenue in the previous accounting period and made a net loss on other \nincome of UAH  276,200.  This made the estimated sales revenue of UAH  955 million  \nresulting in net assets of UAH 555 .5 million seem absurdly  unrealistic . \n332. At a superficial level , all of t hese considerations are potentially explicable by a \ncombination of incompetent management, inadequate internal controls and, in the case \nof the failure to comply with the requirements of the Bank’s credit committee \nregulations and the Charter, a careless disregard for compliance with the applicable \nformalities.  However, looked at more carefully and in their proper context  they are also \nconsistent with agreements to transfer monies to the Borrowers in a manner which  was \nboth dishonest by those who authorised and gave instructions for what occurred and did \nnot amount to the making of genuine loans .  The extreme disregard for proper approval \nprocesses  and the other deficiencies in the manner in which the monies were agreed to \nbe transferr ed supports a conclusion that the latter  is the more probable explanation .  As \nwill appear , this is further confirmed  by a number of other aspects of what occurred, \nincluding the nature of the security provided and how the monies were in fact applied.  \n333. As I have already describ ed, the Bank’s internal documentation discloses a paper trail \npursuant to which the Relevant Loans were approved by the ECC .  Whether the \nIndividual Defendants gave instructions for the Relevant Loans to be agreed and made , \nor otherwise participated in the process, is affected by a number of matters , including \nthe question of whether the Bank h as made out its case that the Individual Defendants \nowned and /or controlled the Borrowers  and/or the Corporate Defendants , as well as \nother e ntities involved in the Misappropriation.  \n334. I shall revert to this aspect of the Bank’s case after I have explained my findings on \nwhat happened after the agreements for the Relevant Loans had been made, but it \nsuffices at this stage to record that:  \ni) The Individual Defendants accept that 32 of the individuals said by them to be \nthe UBO s of the Borrowers, and 35 of the individuals recorded as being directors \nof the Borrowers, are employees of PBC or the Bank and are amongst the \nindividuals who also acted as nominees of the Individual Defendants in relation \nto their own admitted asset hol dings;  \nii) Mr Kolomoisky has admitted that at various stages during the periods in which \nthe Relevant Loans were being made he had an interest in 21 of the 47 Ukrainian \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n85 \n Borrowers (a figure which increased from nine during the course of the \nproceedings) ranging in size from a nominal indirect stake to an interest in \nexcess of 50%; and  \niii) Mr Bogolyubov has admitted that at various stages during the periods in which \nthe Relevant Loans were being made he had an interest in 19 of the 47 Ukrainian \nBorrowers (a figure which increased from 13 during the course of"}

However, despite these admissions of interest, it was Mr Kolomoisky’s pleade d case \nthat he did not exercise day to day control over or manage any of the Ukrainian \nBorrowers , including  Promin met, and Mr Bogolyubov’s pleaded case that he did not \ncontrol any of the Borrowers and that if they entered into any of the various agreements \nalleged by the Bank it was not with his knowledge o r on his instructions.  \n \nThe Supply Agreements  \n336. The next stage in  the process  allege d by the Bank to have been part of the \nMisappropriation was the execution of supply agreements, of which the RSAs  were the \nmost relevant  for the purposes of its claim .  Between October 2013 and August 2014, \nall but one of the  47 Ukrainian Borrowers (the exception being Prominmet ) entered into  \n129 supply agreements  (each a “Supply Agreement”) with 35 different non-Ukrainian \nsuppliers  (the “Suppliers”) , amongst wh ich were the six Corporate Defendants .  Under \nthe Supply Agreements, p rovision was made for the relevant Borrower to ma ke \nprepayments for the supply of goods  to be delivered at a later date , with an obligation \nto return the prepayment in the event of non -delivery by that date .  In no case did any \nof the Suppliers deliver any goods to the Borrowers in accordance with the ir terms .  In \nrelation to 75 of the Supply Agreements  (the “Other Supply Agreements”) , all of which \nwere entered into  in or before May 2014 , there is no dispute that the  prepayments were \nreturned to the Borrowers within approximately 90 days . \n337. The background to the 90 -day return of prepayments related to  Ukrainian currency \ncontrol regulations , a summary of which suffices for present purposes.  During the \nrelevant period, Ukrainian exchange control restrictions were subject to an exception \nwhich permitted Ukrainian residents such as the 47 Ukrainian Borrowers to transfer \nforeign currency to non -resident entities su ch as the Corporate Defendants and other \nSuppliers by way of payment for the supply of imported goods.  Where payments were \nmade in adv ance of delivery, the rules (set out in the Law on Foreign Currency Payment \nProcedures  and various Resolutions made by the NBU) prescribed a maximum length \nof time for the period between the advance of the original foreign currency prepayment \nand the date of the subsequent delivery of goods or the return of the prepayment.  At \none stage (fr om 2 December 2012) the period was 180 days, but by the time of the \nevents with which these proceedings are concerned it had been reduced to 90 days .  \nPenal interest and fines were payable by the Ukrainian resident transferor in the event \nof non -compliance.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n86 \n 338. During the course of May , June, July  and August 2014, each of the Ukrainian \nBorrowers except Pr ominmet entered into 54 further Supply Agreements (the RSAs) \nwith one or more of the Corporate Defendants.

The RSAs provided for the supply of \nindustrial equipment or commodities with a total face value of in excess of US$ 2 \nbillion .  The following summarises the RSAs entered into by  each of the Corporate \nDefendant s: \ni) Between 3 June 2014 and 20 August 2014, 13 of the 47 Ukrainian Borrowers , \nincluding Real -Standart LLC (“Real -Standart”) entered into 14 separate RSAs \nwith Teamtren d for the supply of heavy construction equipment ( heavy \nexcavators, crawler cranes, truck cranes, wheel loaders, wheel excavators and \nconcrete pumps ) with a total contract value of US $509,346,632.  \nii) Between 4 June 2014 and 2 1 August 2014, 13 of the 47 Ukrainian Borrowers \nentered into 15 separate RSAs with Trade Point Agro for the supply of 287,00 0 \ntonnes of PET, 14,400 tonnes of palm oil and 42,707.5 tonnes of apple juice \nconcentrate  with a total contract value of US$ 653,166,000 . \niii) Between 14 May 2014 and 2 1 August 2014, 17 of the 47 Ukrainian Borrowers , \nincluding Gardera LLC (“Gardera”), Milorin LLC (“Milorin”) and Prado LLC \n(“Prado”) , entered into 21 separate RSAs with Collyer  for the supply of a total \nof 2,431,473.95 metric to ns of Australian manganese ore lumps with a total \ncontract value of US$ 775,098,833 . \niv) On 11 July 2014, two Ukrainian Borrowers (Cambel LLC and Vegatorg) entered \ninto separate RSAs with Rossyn for the supply of 561,250 barre ls of Urals grade \ncrude oil  with a  total contract value of US$ 62,300,000.  \nv) On 11 July 2014, on e Ukrainian Borrower , Viglon LLC  (“Viglon” ), entered into \nan RSA with Milbert  for the supply of 300,000 barrels of Urals grade crude oil \nwith a  total contract value of US$ 33,000,000.  \nvi) On 11 July 2014, one Ukrainian Borrower , Inkeriya LLC  (”Inkeriya” ), entered \ninto an RSA with Ukrtransitservice  for the supply of 60,000 barrels of Urals \ngrade crude oil with a  total contract value of US$ 6,300,000.  \n339. Like the 75 Other S upply Agreements entered into on or before May 2014 , each of the \nRSAs provided for the Borrower to make prepayments in respect of  the contract price  \nfor the goods purported to be sold under that RSA .  Each RSA also provid ed for delivery \nwithin a specified period and for the return of the prepayment in the event of non -\ndelivery .  With the exception of four partial prepayments  none of the prepayments made \nin respect of the RSAs were r eturned  to the relevant Borrower.   Those partial \nprepayme nts were a payment by Collyer to Gardera of U S$5 million  on 28 August \n2014 , a payment by Collyer to Milorin of US$29,763, 200 on 1 September 2014, a \npayment by Collyer to Prado of US$32 million on 26 August 2014 and a payment of \nUS$19,195,000 from Teamtrend to Real -Standart on 1 August 2014 .  To the extent that \nprepayments under the RSAs were not repaid , they constitute Unreturned Prepayments . \n340. As I explain ed at the beginning of this judgment , the pleaded case of the Corporate \nDefendants was that the RSAs to which the BVI Defendants were party were genuine.  \nHowever, no positive averments to that effect were made by the Individual Defendants \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n87 \n and, with the exception of  the terms of the RSA s themselves, there was no evidence \nthat anyone involved ever intended that the delivery obligations under them would be \ncomplied with.

Indeed, even the terms of the RSAs themselves are not really evidence \nof an y intent to comply with  their terms because , as I will explain they are sufficiently \nextraordinary to indicate that the rights and obligations for which they appeared to \nprovide make no commercial sense .   \n341. For reasons I shall explain, the cumulative effect of which is compelling, t here are many  \nindications that the RSAs were not genuine supply agreements and that neither the \nborrower nor the supplier ever had any intention that the goods specified would ever be \ndelivered.   I accept the Bank’s submission that each of these RSAs was a sham intended \nto disguise the true nature and purposes of the transfer of funds to which it related.  \n342. The first reason is that there  had never been any delivery of goods under the Other \nSupply Agreements .  Given the similarities between the Other Supply Agreements and \nthe RSAs, t his was a clear indication that the same was likely to be the case under the \nRSAs .  \n343. The second  reason is  that the terms of the RSAs were commercially ridiculous and it \nwas obvious that they could not possibly have been regarded as part of  genuine  trading \nactivity .  As examples , the Bank  established on the evidence that  the quantities to be \nsupplied were  wholly incompatible with any reasonable level of local demand : \ni) The 287,000 tonnes of PET to be supplied  under  RSAs entered into by \nBorrowers with Trade Point Agro dated June to August 2014 was more than \ntwice the total import volume of PET into the whole of Ukraine for the whole \nof the year 2014 . \nii) The 42,707.5 tons of apple juice concentrate to be supplied to Borrowers by \nTrade Point Agro  under RSAs entered into between  June to August 2014 \ncompares to the figure of only 343 ton s of apple juice concentrate imported into \nUkraine in the whole of 2014 and the total Ukrainian production for that year of \n70,000 to 90,000  tons.  \niii) The 2.431 million tonnes of Australi an manganese ore to be supplied under \nRSA s entered into by Borrowers with  Collyer was more than 27 times the total \nimport volume of Australian manganese products into Ukraine for the whole of \n2014 , and 30% of Australia’s national output for the whole of that year.  \n344. The Bank was entitled to submit (and I so find) that those within BOK and the PBC \nwho were preparing the documentation simply reverse engineered the quantities of \ncommodities to be supplied  so that they fitted with the amounts of the Bank’s funds to \nbe transferred .  This meant that the quantities of the subject - matter of the relevant RSA \nwere  absurd.   \n345. The third reason is that the payment terms under the RSAs gave rise to obvious question \nmarks over the genuineness of the contract s.  The prepayments for which they provided \nwere for the full amount of the contract price in advance of delivery , but there was no \nprovision for security in the form of a  performance bond , documentary credit or indeed \nany other form of security, apart from the pledge over the goods to be supplied, which \nwould have been worthless in the event of a failure to deliver .  This security was itself \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n88 \n a further indication of the nature of the RSAs as shams to which I shall revert below.  \nIn my judgment, i t is inconceivable that any genuine agreement for the supply of goods  \nin the quantities and for the prices set out in the RSAs could have been thought to have \nbeen concluded by any person who considered and had regard to their terms.  \n346.

{"start": 325500, "text": " below.  \nIn my judgment, i t is inconceivable that any genuine agreement for the supply of goods  \nin the quantities and for the prices set out in the RSAs could have been thought to have \nbeen concluded by any person who considered and had regard to their terms.  \n346. The fourt h reason is that the evidence establishe d that the Corporate Defendants as \npurported suppliers had no commercial substance , and such information as is available \nrepresented that such activities as they carried out had little if anything to do with  the \nsupplies they had apparently agreed to make under the RSA s.  Three of them had only \none employee and the other three were recorded as having two.  The records held at the \nBank’s Cyprus branch disclosed  that none of them had an office, website or other  public \npresence.  For the period in which they were entering into RSAs under which they \ncontracted to make supplies of goods said to be worth hundreds of millions of US$,  \nwith the right to equivalent prepayments in advance of supply,  each of the English  \nDefendants was either registered as dormant or  filed total exemption small company \naccounts  which disclosed negligible net assets.  \n347. The Bank  has been unable to find any financial statements  for Milbert or \nUkrtransitservice .  Financial statements for  Rossyn  for the relevant period were in the \ntrial bundle.  They are consistent with an actively trading enterprise  but, as the Bank \nsubmitted in its written opening submissions , those assets were almost certainly not  the \nresult of arm’s -length trading operations.   This can be seen from its asset disclosure in \nthese proceedings which confirmed that the only means of realising any part of  the U S$ \n500 million -worth of receivables it disclosed as assets would be by way of assignment  \nof those debt s “to discharge  a corresponding liability which Rossyn ” owes to a creditor .  \nThe same was said on behalf of Milbert and Ukrtransitservice  which also disclosed \nreceivable s with a face value of several hundred millions of US$.  If that was indeed  \nthe only means of liquidating assets generated as a result of their trading activity, the \nclear inference  is that the trades the BVI Defendants  were entering into were with \nrelated parties under common control.  \n348. The pleaded position of the Corporate  Defendants  was that , in entering into the S upply \nAgreements the English Defendants  were acting as agents for the ED P rincip als \npursuant to the English Agency Agreements , in which it was recited that  the ED \nPrincipal s wishe d “to carry on worldwide export and import trading business as well as \ninvestment activity in various countries ”.  Details of the English Agency Agreements \nare as follows : (a) T eamtrend entered into an agency agreement  on or about 13 March \n2014 with  Hangli International Holdings Ltd (“Hangli”) , a BVI company ; (b) Trade \nPoint Agro  concluded an agency agreement on or about 19 March 2009 with \nBrimmilton Ltd (“Brimmilton”) , also a  BVI company ; and (c) Collyer concluded an \nagency agreement on or about 30 January 2014 with  Collard  Securities Limited \n(“Collard”) , a Belize company .  They said that the  English Defendants  did so in good \nfaith, but without seeking to verify the substance of the arrangements for which they \nprovided. They also said  that the RSAs were executed upon the basis that their \nprincip als would supply the relevant goods or repay the prepayments prior to supply \nbecoming due.  \n349. The pleaded position relating to the BVI Defendants was different.  The Corporate \nDefendants  did not assert that the  BVI Defendants  were acting as agents ; rather they \ndenied that the  relevant RSAs  were not intended to create enforceable commercial \nobligations and contended that each of the RSAs to which one of the BVI Defendants  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n89 \n was party was concluded on an arm"}

They went on to  \ncontend that the  BVI Defendants  were in a position either to purchase  oil in the markets  \nin order to make the relevant delivery or would return the prepayment prior to delivery \nfalling due.   As the Bank submitted , that pleaded case assume d that the RSAs were \ngenuine supply agreements to be honoured by the  BVI Defendants .  By the end of the \ntrial that was no longer the  case advanced by the Corporate Defendants . \n350. It is at the heart of the Bank’s case that , as with the Borrowers, the Corporate \nDefendants were also owned and/or controlled by the Individual Defendants .  It was \nMr Bogolyubov ’s pleaded case that he did not own or control the Corporate Defendants \nand that , if they entered into the RSAs with the Borrowers , they did so with out his \nknowledge or instructions.  I shall revert to this aspect of the Bank’s case after I have \nexplained my findings on the remaining stages in the Misappropriation.  \n351. In my view,  what I have just described (together with many of the other findings made \nelsewhere in this judgment) makes clear that , like the Relevant Loans, the RSAs were \nnot what the y purported to be .  They were intended to give to third parties , probably the \nBank’s auditors and the NBU, the appearance of creating legal rights and obligations \nthat bore no re semblance to  any which the Bank , the Borrowers  or the Corporate \nDefendants  intended  to create .  They were put in place for the purposes of concealing \nthe true transaction , which was to enable the transfer of US$ outside Ukraine in a \nmanner which purported to comply with Ukraine’s foreign exchange requirements (but \ndid not in fact do so) through a highly complex loan recycling scheme which operated \nfor the ultimate benefit of the Individual Defendants.  \n \nSecurity for the Relevant Loans  \n352. A further indication that both the Relevant Loans and the RSAs were not what they \npurported to be , and were in fact shams , was the nature of the security apparently \nobtained by the Bank for the Borrowers ’ obligations under the Relevant Loans.  At the \ntime that approvals were given  for each of the Relevant Loans, the proposed terms \nincluded provision for security to be granted by varying types of pledge agreement, \nsome of which identified the asset over which the security was to be granted but many \nof which did not.  In relation to this  security there were often differences between the \ndescriptions given in the Relevant Loan agreeme nts and the descriptions given in the \nminutes of the meetings at which the relevant approvals were given.  The extent to \nwhich the security demonstrated further connections to the Individual Defendants is a \nmatter to which I will revert below, but I accept  the Bank’s submission that the form in \nwhich that proposed security was described was  vague , and was of itself an indication \nthat the Relevant Loans were not genuine . \n353. There were three categories of security which the Bank’s records appeared to disclose , \nall of which are said by  the Bank  to have been  sham s and contrary to public policy .  It \nwas said by the Bank that the reason for this was that the secur ity was not intended to \ncreate enforceable obligations and was put in place on the instructions of the Individual \nDefendants as part of the process of hiding  the Misappropriation.  \n354.

The first category was the RSA Pledges , which were entered into in conjunction with \nagreements between the Borrowers and the Bank to take over the Borrowers ’ rights \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n90 \n against the Corporate Defendants under the RSAs.   There were 53 RSA Pledges entered \ninto by  Borrowers , the first by Rapit LLC  (“Rapit”) on 5 June 2014 and the last of which \nwere entered into  by Darsten  LLC , Inkom 2001 LLC  (“Inkom”) , Rudnex LLC and \nTransmoloko LLC (“Transmoloko”) on 11 September 2014 .  Under the RSA Pledges,  \nthe relevant Borrower  pledged its rights under the RSAs  to the Bank as security for its \nrepayment obligations under one or more of the Relevant Loans.   It is self -evident that \nthis security was only of any value to the extent that the Corporate De fendant s’ \nobligations under the RSAs were themselves valuable assets.  It is the Bank’s case , \nwhich I accept,  that they were not worth the paper they were written on.  \n355. The second category was the LFSA Pledges which purported to be security  granted \nover further agreements  other than RSAs .  The way this was done was that between 5 \nSeptember 2013 and 22 October 2015, 78 LFSAs were entered into between 4 5 of the \nBorrowers and a number of Suppliers .  In 37 instances the LFSA was entered into by \none of the English Defendants  as supplier : 17 by Collyer, 15 by Teamtrend and five by \nTrade Point Agro .  These LFSAs purported to be supply agreements for the purchase \nof industrial equ ipment or commodities.  The Borrowers then pledged the LFSAs  as \nsecurity for their repayment obligations under the Relevant Loans.  In the case of \nseveral of the LFSAs the relevant LFSA Pledge was dated some  time after the date on \nwhich the agreements for the Relevant Loans were executed and the Relevant \nDrawdowns were made.  \n356. In many respects the L FSAs were similar to the RSAs .  They also made provision for \nthe supply of improbable quantities of commodities and goods, which there was never \nany real prospect of the Corporate Defendants being able to supply,  but there was one \nimportant difference.  In  every case the obligation to make payment  was only due to be \nperformed after delivery .  Unlike the RSAs, there was no obligation  to make a \nprepayment in advance.   However, this did not affect the basic point which was  that, \nlike the  RSA Pledges, the LFSA Pledges were only of any value to the extent that the \nSuppliers’ obligations under the L FSAs were themselves valuable assets.  The evidence \nis that they were not  and no positive case was advance d by the Defendants that they \nwere.   I am satisfied that the Bank has established that the parties to them never had \nany intention of supplying the goods under the terms  and that the RSA and LF SA \nPledges were worthless shams . \n357. The Bank  also submitted that it was significant that at least 31 of the LFSA Pledges \nentered into with the Corporate Defendants were executed at the end of  2014, after \nwhat it called the active phase of the Misappropriation had come to an end  and the 2014 \nUkrainian Proceedings had commenced.  I shall explain what happened in those \nproceedings a little later, but they involved claims by the Borrowers for return of the \nprepayments  on the grounds that deliver ies under the RSAs had not been made.

I \nconsider that there is substance in the Bank’s submission that the likely reason for the \nuse of the L FSAs as security was  because documentation need ed to be produced to give \nthe appearance that the Bank’s lending under (amongst other agreements) the Relevant \nLoan s had always been adequately secured.  \n358. The Bank  also submitte d that a clear indication that the LFSA Pledges were all shams, \nwas that that in June 20 15 it accepted security granted by Gardera  and Nautis -Trade \nLLC  (“Nautis -Trade”) over the obligations  of two of the English Defendants  (Trade \nPoint Agro and Collyer ) under LFSAs at a time at which t hose English Defendants were \nalready debtors to the Borrowers for hundreds of million s of dollars under judgments \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n91 \n obtained in the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings .  In such circumstances, those involved in \ngranting and accepting the LFSA Pledges cannot possibly have thought that it would \nconstitute security of  any meaningful value.  \n359. The third category of security was 50 Share Pledges granted by the Share Pledgors: 38 \ncorporate pledgors and two individual  pledgors over shares in 25 companies.   The first \nof these Share Pledges was dated 23 October 2013 and was granted by Everrin \nCommercial SA over its shares in PJSC E rlan as security for the obligations to the Bank \nof three entities, including one of the  Borrowers ( Transmoloko) .  The last was dated 30 \nJune 2016 and was granted by Caserta Trading Limited over shares in Mavex LLC as \nsecuri ty for the obligations to the Bank of two entities, one of which was a  Borrower , \nKarinda LLC  (“Karinda” ).  The Bank contends that each of the Share Pledges was a  \nsham  and/or a  transaction contrary to public policy which w as not intended to create \nenforceable obligations  but was put in place on the instructions of the Individual \nDefendants in order to hide the Misappropriation  and mislead the auditors and \nregulators .  It is the Bank’s case that the Individual Defendants owned and/or controlled \nthe shares which were pledged pursuant to the Share Pledges and the pledgor companies \nthemselves.  \n360. In the event , the Share Pledges were never enforced and they were all released by mid -\nNovember 2016 (i.e. just before nationalisation) .  It was Mr Kolomoisky’s pleaded case \nthat the Bank had planned to release the Share Pledges securing the loans to 193 of its \nborrowers , including 43 of the Borrowers  (the “193 Borrowers” ) and put in place \nsecurity for the New Loans by registering as collateral for the New Loans mortgages \nand pledges of the physical assets owned by the Share Pledg ors.  However, it was his \ncase that this did not occur .  The reason for this  was said to be  that the NBU caus ed the \nNew Borrowers to use the funds advanced by the Bank  pursuant to the Transformation  \nto repay the outstanding loans of the 193 Borrowers (other than the  loan to Tamers a \nLLC ( “Tamersa”) and the loan to Prominmet ), which had the effect of discharging the \ncollateral including the Share Pledges .  It is said  that they did this without the intended \nsecurity for the New Loans being in place . \n361. For reasons which will become apparent later, this  explanation is inherently \nimprobable, given the fact that the NBU ’s interest as regulator was diametrically \nopposed to any reduction in the security available to the Bank , but it is also inconsistent \nwith such evidence as there is.

Thus, Mr Shekmar’s unchallenged evidence was that \nhe never gave any instructions to the Bank to the effect that the loans to the 193 \nBorrowers should be repaid, or that the security should be released, and that he was  \nunaware of  anyone else either from his team or the NBU more generally having done \nso.  Given his role in the conduct of an unscheduled inspection of the Bank at the time \nof the Transformation, it is inconce ivable that he would not have known  of any such \ninstruction if it had been given by the NBU.  \n362. It is also inconsistent with the fact that the process of documenting  the release of the  \nShare Pledges  was orchestrated by Primecap with the partic ipation  of M&H, albeit the \ndates are difficult to identify with any certainty because some at least of the relevant \nagreements  appear to have been backdated from the time they were executed in \nNovember 2016 to an earlier date in October  2016 .  But whenever the process was \ncompleted, there  is no evidence that  it was done so at the behest of the NBU . \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n92 \n 363. As to the identity of the owners or controllers of the Share Pledgors, i t has always been \nMr Kolomoisky’s case that they included companies owned and/or controlled by him \nand Mr Bogolyubov .  The list of those falling within that category  expanded during the \ncourse of these proceedings, such that by  the time of his written opening submissions, \nMr Kolomoisky had admitted to owning or controlling 2 2 of the 38 corporate Share \nPledgors and a substantial majority  of the companies whose shares were the subject of \nthe Shares Pledges  (the latest amendments to the lists were made in December 2022) . \n364. However, Mr Kolomoisky’s pleaded case was that the fact that assets in which he was \ninterested were used to secure particular loans di d not imply that he had an interest in  \neither the loan or the borrower concerned.  In particular he said that he provided a \nnumber of assets to the Bank for its use as collateral for loa ns as necessary a nd that he \nwas not responsible for determining precisely how they were to be used.  It also \nremained his case until well into the trial that  the Share Pledges fully secured the sums \ndrawn down under the Relevant Loans.  The way it was explained in the interlocutory \nevidence on behalf of Mr Kolomoisky was that this security:  \n“was provided by way of pledges over the \"corporate rights\" of companies i.e. \nshares in valuable companies with significant production and trading activities \ngenerating cashflows and holding real assets (“the Share Pledges”). This security \nwas examined and accepted by PwC over  successive audits.”  \nAnd the way that the point was put in his Re-Re-Re-Amended Defence dated May 2022  \nwas as follows:  \n“It is denied that the use of assets in which Mr Kolomoisky was interested to secure \nparticular loans implies that he had an interest in the particular loan or the borrower \nconcerned.  Mr Kolomoisky provided a number of such assets to  the Bank for its \nuse as collateral for loans as necessary and he was not responsible for determining \nprecisely how they were to be used.”  \n365. Mr Bogolyubov’s position was similar although it was  expressed slightly differently. It \nwas said on his behalf both in his pleadings and his written opening submissions that \nhe was a beneficiary under a discretionary trust which held an ownership interest in \nsome of the Share Pledge Companies, that he gave his general agreement to the Bank  \nthat assets in which he held an interes"}
{"start": 343000, "text": "l for loans as necessary and he was not responsible for determining \nprecisely how they were to be used.”  \n365. Mr Bogolyubov’s position was similar although it was  expressed slightly differently. It \nwas said on his behalf both in his pleadings and his written opening submissions that \nhe was a beneficiary under a discretionary trust which held an ownership interest in \nsome of the Share Pledge Companies, that he gave his general agreement to the Bank  \nthat assets in which he held an interest could be provided to the Bank as security and \nwas aware in general terms that security had been given. However, it was also said there \nis no evidence suggesting he was aware of, or at all involved in, the grant of the \nparticular Share Pledges themselves.   He accepted , anyway for the purposes of these \nproceedings that Mr Kolomoisky’ s identification of the Share Pledgors owned and/or \ncontrolled by the Individual Defendants was accurate.  He also said that , to the extent  \nhe was aware of and consented to the shares of companies or other assets in which he \nhad an economic interest being pledged to the Bank as security, he did so in order to \nimprove the Bank’s capital and  its financial position and not because he had (or was \naware of having) any interest in the borrowers whose loans were thus secured.  \n366. The Bank did not accept t he cases of the Individual Defendants  on this point .  They said \nit was clear that they  owned and/or contro lled those other Share Pledgors whose  \nownership and control was not admitted.  They relied on a number of considerations, \nmany of which were interlinked with the evidence which goes to the ownership and \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n93 \n control of both the Borrowers and the Corporate Defendants .  I shall revert to this \nimportant issue in that context . \n367. However, it is right to say at this stage that the Bank is correct to submit that there is no \nevidence of any agreement between it and the Individual Defendants recording or \nreferring to the terms on which they now say that the Bank was entitled to use their \nassets as security.  I also accept that it is inherently incredible to suppose  that either of \nthem agreed to grant such pledge s as security for lending to unconnected borrowers on \nan open -ende d basis .  It is something that no rational commercial busines smen would \ndo, most particularly where the entities to whom the relevant loans were to be made \nwould (on their case) have been wholly unknown to them . \n368. In addition to these three categories of security, the Bank also relied on the fact that , in \nAugust 2014 , two companies , which it said were  owned or controlled by the Individual \nDefendants , purported to grant security  for sums said to be outstanding from seven  of \nthe 47 B orrowers  (Agro prom, Esmola, Favore LLC  (“Favore”) , Imris LLC  (“Imris”) , \nIndustrial  Garant LLC, Mastein  LLC  (“Mastein”)  and Prado) .  In the case of one of \nthose companies , PJSC Nikopol Ferroalloy Plant (“NFP”), the security took the form \nof a pledge of certain rights under a prepayment supply agreement , quantities of  \nmanganese ore and  certain equipment.  In the case of the other , PJSC Ordzhon okidze \nMining and Processing Plant (“OGOK”), the security took the form of a pledge of \nmanganese concentrate.  \n369. This security was arranged  as a result of correspondence within BOK between Natalia \nShvetsova and Ms Gurieva , and an e -mail at the end of August indicated that Mr \nMelnyk was to sign for at least five of the seven Borrowers  (Agroprom, Esmola, Favore, \nMastein and Prado) , presumably on the basis that he was recorded within the Bank as \ntheir UBO.   But this security, even if effective,  was not in place for very long , because \nit was all release d through termination of the relevant pledge agreements  at some stage \nduring the course of Septe mber 2014 .

But this security, even if effective,  was not in place for very long , because \nit was all release d through termination of the relevant pledge agreements  at some stage \nduring the course of Septe mber 2014 .  On 12 September 2014, Ms S hvetsova had told \nMs Melnikova  that this was being done “with regard to the upcoming closure of these \ncompanies” , which was a reference to the closure of the seven Borrowers I have listed \nabove , all of whom were described as ferrotrader companies . \n370. Mr Kolomoisky accepted that h e was then an indirect owner of 24.79% of NFP and \nheld a 24.3% interest in OGOK, but denied that he controlled either of them or that it \nis to be inferred from the fact that companies owned and/or controlled by him pledged \nshares or assets to secure the Relevant Loans that he owned and/or controlled the \nBorrowers, being companies whose loans were thereby secured.  \n371. Mr Bogolyubov’s pleading was more specific . He denied that he or Mr Kolomoisky \nowned or controlled either of NFP or OGOK .  It was pleaded that , although he had \ninput on certain operational matters during the period, such as the approval of monthly \nbudgets , he did not determine the decisions and actions of either company .  He pleaded \nthat b oth of the companies  had their own management and supervisory boards of which \nhe was not a member  and that any decisions requiring the approval of their shareholders \ncould  only be taken with the agreement of the other shareholders .  In particular , he \ndenied that he in fact caused either NFP or OGOK to grant the security I have referred \nto, or to approve or consent to its grant.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n94 \n 372. In my view, it is unlikely that any of this was done withou t the consent and approval of \nthe Individual Defendants.   There is clear evidence that those involved in these short \nterm pledge agreements ( Ms Gurieva and Ms Melnikova in particular ) were accustomed \nto communicating with both of the  Individual Defendants  on a regular basis in relatio n \nto their assets .  In light of the nature of the relationships they had with Mr Kolomoisky \nand Mr Bogolyubov, apparent as they are from  such of the documentation  as ha s \nsurvived , it is most improbable that they would have sought to arrange security over the \nassets of companies in which both of the Individual Defendants had such a significant \ninterest (even if not technically a controlling interest) without the ir express or tacit \napproval and consent.  \n \nThe Relevant Drawdowns  \n373. The Relevant Loans were expressed to take the form of revolving credit fa cilities  and, \nconsistently with that characterisation, the funds said to be available under each \nRelevant Loan w ere drawn down over a period of time.   For the purposes of its claim, \nwhat matters is that the Bank’s transactional data  recorded that drawdowns  made under \nthe Relevant Loans  were used  in the 90-day cycle of prepayments and returns of \nprepayments under the Supply Agreements.  \n374. More specifically, during a period commencing on 1 November 2013 and ending on 1 \nSeptember 2014, the Borrowers made 270 drawdowns under the 134 Relevant Loans, \n83 of which were made in US$, totalling US$1,558,599,352 and 187 of which were \nmade in UAH, totalling UAH 8,803,056 ,367.270.   Most of the Relevant Drawdowns \nwere made in the first half of 2014 , but they were also made outside this period.  Thus \nthe first  were made on 1 November 2013 by Inkom , which drew down two sums of \nUS$30 million and US$12 million under Relevant Loans dated 31 July 2013 and 19 \nApril 2013 respectively .  The last were made on 1 September 2014 wh"}

Most of the Relevant Drawdowns \nwere made in the first half of 2014 , but they were also made outside this period.  Thus \nthe first  were made on 1 November 2013 by Inkom , which drew down two sums of \nUS$30 million and US$12 million under Relevant Loans dated 31 July 2013 and 19 \nApril 2013 respectively .  The last were made on 1 September 2014 when Inkom drew \ndown US $5 million under a Relevant Loan dated 21 January 2014 , Milorin drew down \ntwo sums of US$19 million and US$10,763,200 under Relevant Loan s dated 12 \nFebruary 2014 and 25 February 2014 respectively , Tekhspetsmontazh LLC \n(“Tekhspets ”) drew down US$17 million under a Relevant Loan dated 6 November \n2013 and Transmoloko drew down  US$10 million  under a Rel evant Loan dated 11 \nJanuary 2014 . \n375. These  drawdowns  were characterised by the Bank as Relevant Drawdowns because \nthey were said to have funded (in whole or in part, and whether directly or indirectly) \nthe Unreturned Prepayments.  The US$ equivalent of the Relevant Drawdowns made \nin UAH totalled US$777 mill ion (applying the NBU daily exchange rate as at the date \nof each drawdown).  The total amount of the Relevant Drawdowns expressed in US$ \nwas therefore US$2,335,943,519.  \n376. The way in which the flow of funds operated in gen eral was that where a Relevant \nDrawdown was made in UAH, it was converted into US$.  The US$ proceeds of each \nRelevant D rawdown w ere then transferred to the account of one of the Suppliers, \namongst which were the Corporate Defendants, at the Bank’s Cypr us branch.  The \nBank’s transactional data recorded these as prepayments under one of the Supply \nAgreements (identified as such by a reference).  This was done to maintain a record of \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n95 \n what would otherwise have been a prohibited transfer of foreign currency out of \nUkraine by the Borrowers.  \n377. In the case of the Corporate Defendants, t he funds to make  prepayments under an RSA \nwere therefore credited to their accounts at the Bank pursuant to electronic transfers by \nthe relevant Borrower.  On the same day there was an onward transfer of the amount of \nthe prepayment to another account with the Bank which was held (a) in the case of the \nEnglish Defendants, in the name of the relevant ED P rincipal (Hangli, Brimmilton and \nCollard) or a third party supposedly identified by that principal or (b) in the c ase of the \nBVI Defendants, in the name of a third party.    \n378. On or about the expir y of the 90-day period to which I have already referred, the \nprepayments were recorded in the Bank’s transactional data as being returned  to the \nBorrower .  Where that occurred, the Borrower was  required by rules promulgated by \nthe NBU to convert 50% of the US$ receipt into UAH.  The conversion obligation was \nincreased from 50% to 100% for a short period from 21 August 2014 to 22 September \n2014 and then reduced again (this time to 75%) for the pe riod from 23 September 2014 \nuntil 8 June 2 016.  In practice, the Borrower then re -converted at least some of those \nUAH back into US$ in order to make what was recorded in the Bank’s transactional \ndata as the next prepayment under a new Supply Agreement.  This next prepayment  \nwas almost invariably made on the same day as the return of the original prepayment.  \nThe Borrower might also have to make additional drawdowns under its Relevant Loan \nin order to cover (a) the costs of a compulsory national pension insurance fee payable \nwhen purchasing foreign  currency (b) the losses arising out of the application of \ndifferent foreign exchange rates and (c) in some instances to provide any additional \nfunds required to make the next prepayment by way of a further drawdown.  \n379. The Bank’s case , as reflected in the contem"}

The Bank’s case , as reflected in the contemporaneous transactional data  which linked \nSupply Agreement references where available and used exact matching where they \nwere not, was that the Relevant Drawdowns  were used by the Borrowers as the direct \nor in direct source of  prepayments under the RSAs , and more particularly were the \nsource of the Unreturned Prepayments .  In 12 instances,  Relevant Drawdown s (of \nwhich there were 20  falling into this category)  were the direct source of an Unreturned \nPrepayment .  In those instances , as soon as mon ey was draw n down under the Relevant \nLoans , it was tra nsferred to a Corporate Defendant  by way of purported prepayment \nunder an RSA .  As th e Bank put it, the Relevant Drawdowns passed through the \nBorrowers to the Corporate Defendants at which stage they were at their disposal as \npurported suppliers under the RSAs.    \n380. This process of recycling continued until the end of August 2014.  It is the Bank’s case \nthat from that time onwards, the Suppliers to which the prepayments had been made, \ndid not return them.  These Suppliers were the Corporate Defendants, and the \nprepayments which each of them received were made under the RSAs.  The \nconsequen ce was that an aggregate amount of US$1,911,877,385, being the net amount \nof the 82 Unreturned Prepayments, was paid to the Corporate Defendants but not \nreturned by them to the 46 Borrowers which had originally made them within the \nstipulated 90 day period .  The Bank  pleaded that the total Unreturned Prepayments were \nbroken down as between the six Corporate Defendants .  There was no dispute that the \nBank’s transaction data disclose d that the following  description of the breakdown was \naccurate : Team trend: US$474,775,152;  Trade Point Agro: US$653,166,000 ; Collyer: \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n96 \n US$683,936,233; Rossyn: US$61,000,000; Milbert: US$33,000,000 and \nUkrtransit service: US$6,000,000.  \n381. The figure of US$1,911,877,385 is corroborated by the Kazantsev Spreadsheet  which \nconstituted a series of 98 worksheets  prepared on an approximately twice weekly basis  \nfor the period between 30 December 2013 and 1 September 2014.   These work sheets \nwere maintained by Mr Kazantsev , who gave evidence for Mr Kolomoisky during the \ninterlocutory stage of these proceedings but was not called to give evidence at the trial.  \nThe worksheets  demonstrate that BOK was keeping track of the prepayments and \nreturns of prepayments and that it was recording the total amount of the prepayments \nunreturned from time to time by reference to supply agreement numbers.   It shows that \nthey were all being treated as part of a single scheme.  It is an important source of \ninformation which assists in justifying the  methodology adopt ed by the Bank when \nlinking the Unreturned Prepayment to the harm caused to the Bank by the making of \nthe Relevant Drawdowns.  \n382. The 82 Unreturned P repayments  recorded in the Kazantsev Spreadsheet were all made \nbetween 28 May 2014 and 1 September 2014.

The last five Relevant Drawdowns and \nthe last four Unreturned Prepayments were made on 1 September 2014 by four separate \nBorrowers: Inkom which made an Unreturned Prepayment of US$5 million to \nTeamtrend, Milorin which made an Unreturned Prepayment of US$ 29,763,200  million \nto Collyer, Tekhspets which made an Unreturned Prepayment of US$17 million to \nCollyer and Transmoloko which made a n Unreturned Prepayment of US$10 million to \nTrade Point Agro.  The last worksheet shows  outstanding prepayments which had not \nbeen returned totalling  US$1,911,877,385 , and no prepayment was returned after that \ndate.  \n383. The Kazan tsev Spreadsheet is not just significant as confirmation  that the Unreturned \nPrepayments were never  made as arms -length prepayments  under  genuine supply \nagreements .  It identifies the same Unreturned Prepayments as the Bank has identified \nand demonstrates that employees of B OK linked  prepayments to returns of prepayment s \nby reference to supply agreement numbers and lists the same companies, viz., the \nBorrowers and the Corporate Defendants, as the Bank has identified as having been \ninvolved in the Misappropriation. It also evidences  the fact that the prepayments to the \nCorporate Defendants formed part of a single scheme  and that the ending of the scheme \nwhen , as the Bank put it in closing, the music stopped , took place at the beginning of \nSeptember 2014.  \n384. In my view, it is of material significance that Mr Kazantsev was not called by the \nDefendants to give evidence .  He was prepared to give written evidence for Mr \nKolomoisky in 2018 and  it has not been said that he was disabled in any way from \ngiving evidence at the trial.  It has long been  obvious (from e.g., the first report of the \nBank’s forensic expert dated 24 November 2021) that the Kazantsev Spreadsheet would \nbe relied on by the Bank as  confirmatory  evidence of the way in which it treated \nprepayments in its transactional data.  \n385. I make a similar finding in relation to the other document which corroborated the \nconclusions reached by the Bank’s forensic expert as derived from the Bank’s \ntransactional dat a.  This was  the Gurieva Spreadsheet , which  was dated 19 November \n2014 .  It was found on a device used by Ms Gurieva  and a copy of it was also held by \nMr Novikov .  Some of the information on it was difficult to understand , but the essential \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n97 \n parts were clear enough.  It recorded in 41 columns details of each of the Borrower s, \nthe outstanding loan balances  summarised by Borrower  and the Unreturned \nPrepayments , including the date , the recipient and the RSA  under which each \nUnreturned Prepayment was made.  It also recorded the returns of prepayments  which \npreceded the Unreturned Prepaym ents in the cycle of payments between Borrowers  and \nthe collateral in the form of Share Pledges for the loans.  Much of this information is \nwholly  consistent with th e Bank’s case on how the  Unreturned Prepayments were \nfunde d.  Like the Kazantsev Spreadsheet, the Gurieva Spre adsheet  evidenced the same \nUnreturned Prepayments made by Borrowers to the Corporate Defendants by reference \nto specific RSAs , showing the same amount of US$1,911,877,385 a s outstanding from \nthe Corporate Defendants to Borrowers in respect of the Unreturned P repayments.  \n386. I therefore accept that t he Gurieva Spreadsheet is  contemporaneous evidence of  a direct \nlink between the Unreturned Prepayments and the amounts outstanding under  the \nRelevant L oans, using references to specific RSAs , and justifies the methodology \nadopted by the Bank.   It confirms that there was a co -ordinated scheme by which the \nBorrowers took purported loans from the Bank and used those funds to make \nUnreturned Prepayments to the Corporate Defendants  a"}

I therefore accept that t he Gurieva Spreadsheet is  contemporaneous evidence of  a direct \nlink between the Unreturned Prepayments and the amounts outstanding under  the \nRelevant L oans, using references to specific RSAs , and justifies the methodology \nadopted by the Bank.   It confirms that there was a co -ordinated scheme by which the \nBorrowers took purported loans from the Bank and used those funds to make \nUnreturned Prepayments to the Corporate Defendants  and that all the companies \ninvolved were under common co ntrol. It is also good evidence that (in the majority of \ncases) the Unreturned Prepayments were the final transaction in a cycle of prepayments \nand returns of prepayment s. It is recorded  on a working document maintained by  the \nhead of BOK  (of which Mr Novikov  had a copy ) and is consistent with the Bank’s case \non Unreturned Prepayment s. \n387. It is also of relevance that a  comparison of the two documents demonstrates that no \nprepayments were repaid between the date of the last of the worksheets in the Kazantsev \nSpreadsheet (1 September 2014) and the date of the Gurieva Spreadsheet  (19 November \n2014 ), linking them to the Bank’s outstanding loans to the Borrowers.   As Mr \nThompson pointed out this was significant, because, according to the Kazantsev \nSpreadsheet, most of the Unreturned P repayments were due to be returned under the \nRSAs  before the date of the Gurieva Spreadsheet , but that did not occur . \n388. The figure of US$1,911,877,385 was also computed by Mr Thompson, having \nidentified from the Bank’s transactional data amounts that were returned by a Supplier \nto a Borrower approximately 90 days after the original prepayment was made.  Each of \nthese repaym ents was recorded in the data by reference to the same supply agreement \nthat was referred to in relation to the original prepayment.  The amounts so returned \nwere then followed by a further prepayment to one of the Corporate Defendants.  \n389. In the majority of instances, the full amount of the prepayment under the RSAs, being \nthe total contract value under the RSA s, is said by the Bank now to be an Unreturned \nPrepayment because the items of industrial equipment or relevant commodities were \nnever supplied and no part of the prepayments which had been made were ever returned.  \nHowever, although this was the case in re spect of most of the RSAs, it was not the case \nin respect of all of them because the aggregate of the contract values under the RSA s \n(US$2,039,211,465) exceeded the value of the Unreturned Prepayments \n(US$1,911,877,385).  \n390. This difference reflects the fact that, in four instances, part of a prepayment under an \nRSA was returned.  Those four instances were prepayments made by three of the \nBorrowers (Gardera, Milorin and Prado) to Collyer totalling US$66,763,200 and by one \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n98 \n of the Borrowers (Real -Standart) to Teamtrend totalling US$19,195,000.  That part is \nreferred to in the Bank’s expert evidence as a “Partial Return of Prepayment”.  The \nbreakdown of how these figures are reached is included in schedules to the Bank’s \nstatements of case, but it is not necessary to go through them in this judgment because \nnone of the Defendants put in issue the Bank’s case as to how those figures were broken \ndown.  \n391. However , there are some aspects of the Guriev a Spreadsheet which founded a \nsubmission on behalf of Mr Bogolyubov  that distinguished between two different \ncategories of Relevant Drawdown, described by Ms Montgomery as Type 1 and Type \n2 cases .  This categorisation was utilised  during  the cross -examination of  the Bank’s \nwitnesses and was summarised in counsel’s  closing submissions  as a reflection of the \nfact that there is no direct link between most (US$2.049 billion) of the Relevant \nDrawdowns and the Unretur ned Prepayments  (these were called Type 2"}

Instead, i t was said that in  six of the 12 Type 1 cases, the Gurieva Spreadsheet  record s \nthe subsequent use of the Unreturned Prepayment on a funds flow basis  to fund returns \nof prepayment s to other Borrowers .  The submission which was then m ade was that the \nBank’s methodology ignored what the n happened to the monies.  It was said on behalf \nof Mr Bogolyubov that the reality was that the funds did not stop with the Corporate \nDefe ndants, because, in Type 1 cases , and adopting a funds flow methodology , the \nmoney the n came straight back to the Bank to repay other lending and in Type 2 cases , \nit shows how the Unreturned Prepayments were in fact funded  by an intra -day overdraft \nby which the Corporate Defendants  made the previous return of prepayment to the \nBorrower by drawing down on an overdraft facility, an d the effect of the  Unreturned \nPrepayment by the Borrower to the Corporate Defenda nts was to repay the overdraf t. \n393. It was then said that the Gurieva Spreadsheet showed that almost all of the Unreturned \nPrepayments, US$1.811 billion of US$1 .911 billion , immediately cycled back to the \nBank . I agree with the Bank’s submission that it does not support that conclusion, \nbecause the US$1.811 billion figure recorded in the relevant column is a figure which \nis largely made up of  previous returns of prepayment and not the subsequent use of the \nUnreturned Prepayment.   In any event , none of the  forensic accountants have traced the \nentirety of the Unreturned Prepayments back to the Bank in that way.  \n394. It follows that t hese submissions were said to have been substantiated by an \ninterpretation of the Gurieva Spreadsheet, which is not in my judgment justified by the \nevidence .  As Mr Davidson  confirmed in his cross -examination, while there were  \nexamples of  intra-day overdraft funding , there we re also other examples of instance s \nwhere money ha d seemed to come in from somewhere else .  There was also no evidence \nfrom any witness as to the existence of any form of clearing service offered by the Bank \nand the Gurieva Spreadsheet made no reference to it.  \n395. In Mr Bogolyubov’s opening submissions, the Gurieva Spreadsheet and Kazantsev \nSpreadsheet were said to be “artefactual, recording the legend that the Bank was seeking \nto promote rather than the real transactions and their true purpose”.   However I accept \nthe Bank’s submission that the RSAs and their surrounding documentation served a \npurpose, even if the RSAs themselves were shams.   They provided cover for the 90 -day \ncycles of prepayments and returns  and were  necessary to give the appearance of \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n99 \n compliance with Ukrainian  currency control restrictions , the consequ ences and working \nthrough of which were then recorded in the spreadsheets . \n396. Thus, to reiterate, when the Borrower applied to convert UAH into US$, it made express \nreference to the Supply Agreements which justified the conversion  and there was clear \nevidence in the papers that , where  the Bank failed to ensure prepayments were recorded \nas returned within 90 days , the Borrower was fined .

This was also apparent from the \nfact that, w here US $ prepayments were returned, they often had to be converted into \nUAH and back to US $, which was another currency control requirement, thereby \ntrigge ring the payment of a compulsory national pension insurance fe e.  As Mr \nThompson confirmed this necessitated additional drawdowns, in the form of  ‘FX top-\nups’ to compensate for the currency of the pension  fund charge and the conversion of \nthe US $ to UAH and back again.  Likewise,  in the light of  the Unreturned  Prepayments, \nthe 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings were brough t in orde r to avoid the penal  consequences \nof those currency control restrictions , a matter to which I will refer in more detail later.  \n397. This all highlights the question at the heart of the Bank’s case and the defence sought \nto be advanced by Mr Bogolyubov in particular.  The Bank submitted that it  is clear \nthat the true purpose of what was recorded in the Gurieva and Kazantsev  Spreadsheets  \nwas misappropriation and money laundering. Mr Bogolyubov accept ed that the purpose \nwas to evade currency control regulations, but for the first time in opening , he sought  \nto advance a positive but unpleaded case that there was a wider exercise consisting of \na pattern of lending , which constituted (improper) loan recycling.   However , although \nthis unpleaded argument  provide d the foundation for a use of funds defence, which \nrelates to  the proper compensation  to which the Bank is entitled and to which I will \nrevert later in this judgment , the argument based on a wider impropriety or fraud is not \nexculpatory of the Defendants’ conduct.   I agree that t he loan recycling , and most \nparticula rly the use of sham supply agreements and prepayment / repayment cycles to \nevade currency controls (and hence detection) , is wholly consistent with the Bank’s \ncase.  \n398. As the Bank submitted, and as I agree, if and to the extent that there was earlier \nfraudulent conduct which followed a similar pattern, then that would serve only to \nprovide yet further confirmation as to the fraudulent nature of the Misappropriation. \nThe Bank did not dispute that there was or may have been other improper loan recycling \nprior to April 2013, although it pointed out (correctly) that the extent and nature of this \nrecycling wa s not in evidence, as it was no part of the Defendants’ pleaded case.   I think \nthat the Bank is correct to submit that Mr Bogolyubov’s case on this point amounts to \nnothing more than a factual concession that there was indeed this type of fraudulent \nconduct at the Bank ; it does not somehow provide a defence . \n399. As the Bank pointed out, the fundamental point which is not addressed by the argument  \nnow made by  Mr Bogolyubov is that there is no credible argument as to why what was \ndone was being done.  What was its real purpose?  T he Bank’s very simple submission \nwas that the  elaborate scheme, involving the continua l movement of US$ in 90 -day \ncycles from Ukraine to Cyprus and back  again pursuant to a raft of  sham documentation  \nwas not just being done for the sake of moving money in and out of Ukraine.  It must \nhave been for a substantial purpose, the effect of which was revealed when the music \nstopped at the end of the active stage of the Misappropriation i.e., the outstanding \nbalance in the form of the Unreturned Prepayments.

Consistently with this purpose, i t is the Bank’s case that the end of what it called the \nactive phase of the Misappropriation meant that each of the Corporate Defendants  had \nreceived the benefit of a prepayment for which they had neither delivered goods nor \nreturned the money  and the Borrower did not receive a return of prepayment from which \nit could repay its Relevant Loan .  It is said that the loss to the Bank by reason of the \nfraudulent scheme was in the amount of the unrepaid Relevant Drawdowns, which, \ngiven the nature of the scheme, was  approximately the same amount as the total of the \nUnreturned Prepayments.  \n401. The end of this recycling  coincided with the passing by the NBU of resolution  540 \ndated 29 August 20 14 designed to prevent the use of Ukraine’s financial system for \nmoney laundering and terrorist financing.   It required a bank’s leadership to take under \ntheir personal control the implementation of foreign exchange trading  and introduced \nprocedures “in order to prevent unfair practices of foreign exchange transactions, in \nparticular the purchase of foreign currency under fictitious agreements ”. Those \nprocedu res included the formation of registers to be submitted to the NBU on the date \nof receipt of a client’s application for the purchase of foreign currency, together with \naccompanying documentation .  Three days later, on 1 September 2014,  the NBU wrote  \nto affected institution s including the Bank explaining how requests to purchase foreign \ncountry currency would need to be submitted in the future . \n402. The end of the recycling also coincided with the completion of an NBU inspection or \naudit report dated 15 August 2014,  the purpose of which  was to assess the quality and \nrisk of transactions with shareholders and related part ies as at 1 May 2014.   Its \nconclusions were that there was a high level of insider lending which had an adverse \neffect on the Bank’s capital.   It also concluded that the Bank’s risk management systems \nfor related lending  were deficient .  It recorded  that loans were provided to “newly \ncreated companies with almost no  activity” and secured by  a “high share of low -\nliquidity collateral” – “80% of the collateral accepted by the Bank for calculating loan \nimpairment provisions was rights to after -acquired goods to be delivered at a later date”. \nIt is plain that it identified concerns with credit concentrations among groups of \nborrowers and inherently risky lending to borrowers conducting unprofitable activities.   \n403. All of this would have supported the impression of unlawful lending and is supportive \nof the Bank’s case as to the underlying purpose of the loan recycling scheme.  Indeed, \nthis report was relied on by Mr Kolomoisky as an indication that the NBU knew about \nmany of the problems of which the Bank now complains by August 2014, a \nconsideration  which was said to be relevant to the Limitation Defence.   It was also \nsubmitted that the report would have been available to members of the Bank’s l egal \ndepartment, the M anagement Board, the ECC and the Internal Audit Committee.  \n404.

These kinds of issues seem to have been well suspected in the market in any event.  In \na 2020 publication of which Ms Gontareva was a co -author , she said the following \nabout her understanding of the Bank at the time she became Governor of the NBU in \nJune 2014:  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n101 \n “As a market participant, I already knew PrivatBank had major problems. One \ndidn't have to be a chartered financial analyst to conclude that the major share of \nPrivatbank's loans went to the related parties. Even for an outsider it was obvious, \nhaving attra cted one -third of all deposits of the banking system, that Privatbank did \nnot have any loan to a large company not affiliated with the owners as its client. It \nwas thus clear to everybody in the market, but not for Privatbank's external \nauditors, who cont inued to sign auditor's reports showing 5% related -party lending \nalong with financial statements saying that more than one -third of all bank loans \nwent to ferroalloy and petroleum refining businesses, which were officially known \nto be owned by the bank's s hareholders. ” \n405. The consequence of the failure by the Corporate Defendants to repay the Unreturned \nPrepayments was that the penal interest and fines I have referred to above were payable , \nunless the Economic Court of Dnepropetrovsk or the International Commercial \nArbitration  Court at the Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce and Industry entertained \nproceedings by the Borrowers  to recover the amount of the prepayment.   The Foreign \nCurrency Payments Law provided that those  penalties would be reactivated in the event \nthat the procee dings were unsuccessful , but would not be payable from the date on  \nwhich the court entertained the claim in the event that it decided in favour of the \nclaimants.   It is the Bank’s case , which I have concluded is correct, that the 2014 \nUkrainian Proceedings , which were brought in respect of the Corporate Defendants ’ \nfailure either to deliver under the RSAs or to repay the Unreturned Prepayments , were \ndesigned to deal with the legal consequences of what had been going on and to hide its \ntrue nature.  \n \nCash Repayments and the  Intermediary Loans  \n406. As I have already explained, it is the Defendants’ case that the Relevant Loans were \nrepaid from a number of sources and that the loss claimed by the Bank, arising as it \ndoes out of the making of the Relevant Drawdowns, has therefore been extinguished.  \nThe first of these sources is said to have been cash, substantially all of which came from \nIntermediary Drawdowns made under both Relevant Loans and further Intermediary \nLoans granted to both the Borrowers and 3 4 further Ukrainian borrowers which I have \nalready described as the Intermediary Borrowers.  These Intermediary Loans were \nagreed during what the Bank has called the active stage of the Misappropriation and for \na period of time thereafter.  The second sour ce is the Asset Transfers.  The third source \nis what were called the New Loans totalling c.US$5.7 billion made by the Bank to 36 \nNew Borrowers in October and November 2016 as part of the Transformation.  \n407.

Although the List of Issues does not identify any \nsubstantive disputed issues in relation to the detail of how the Intermediary Drawdowns \nand the Intermediary Loans were described and recorded in the Bank’s transactional \ndata, the question whether either or both of the Individual Defendants ultimately owned \nand/or controlled any of the Intermediary Borrowers, and if so which ones, was very \nmuch in issue, as was the question of whether the Intermediary Drawdowns were \nprocured by either or both of them.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n102 \n 408. These questions are directly related to the other substantive area of dispute on th is part \nof the case: the Ukrainian law question of whether the Intermediary Loans were shams \nor transactions contrary to Ukrainian public policy or void as amounting to related party \nlending, with the consequence that what might otherwise have been treated a s \nrepayments of Relevant Drawdowns by Intermediary Drawdowns stand to be ignored.  \nI shall deal later with these Ukrainian law issues, including whether or not what \noccurr ed served to extinguish any liability the Defendants may have had in tort for their \nparticipation in the scheme.  However, it is an important part of the Bank’s case that, \nas with the Relevant Loans, the Intermediary Loans were part of a loan recycling \nscheme, were further illegitimate sham lending made to entities which were owned \nand/or controlled by the Individual Defendants and were intended simply to keep the \nwheels of the fraud turning.  \n409. It was common ground that, taking the period 1 April 2013 to the period immediately \nprior to the Asset Transfers, amounts said to constitute Relevant Drawdowns in the \ncurrency of the applicable Relevant Loan totalling US$2.172 billion and UAH 15.283 \nbillio n were recorded in the Bank’s transactional data as having been made.   It was \nalso common ground that, during the same period, sums said by the Defendants to be \nCash Repayments amounting to U S$1.195 billion  and UAH 10 .892 b illion were  \nrecorded in the Bank ’s transactional data as having been paid.   If effective as such, the \neffect of these Cash Repayments would have been to leave outstanding balances of \napproximately US$976 million and UAH 4.391 billion prior to the Asset Transfer s. \n410. The Bank’s expert evidence confirms that its transactional data discloses that the first \nmeans by which Relevant Drawdowns were said to have been repaid by what the First \nDefendant called “cash” was through the return of a prepayment which had been made \non an earlier date, where that earlier prepayment had, in turn, been made using the \nproceeds of an Intermediary Drawdown.  The second means was where a Relevant \nDrawdown was purportedly repaid using the proceeds of a further loan (in the form of \nan Intermedi ary Loan) which was drawn down after the Relevant Drawdown.  In that \ninstance, the proceeds of the further borrowing from the Intermediary Borrower were \nthen applied in partial repayment of the Borrower’s outstanding obligations under the \nRelevant Loan.  \n411. Like the SOFs in relation to the Borrowers, the 34 SOFs which have been prepared by \nthe Bank in relation to the Intermediary Borrowers were accepted by all parties as \naccurately reflecting the documents on the basis of which they were prepared.

I was not \ntaken  through any of the SOFs for the Intermediary Loans during the course of the trial, \nbut they were referred to in the written submissions and I have been through many \nalthough not all  of them.  It is plain that the approval processes had the same \ncharacteristics and deficiencies as applied to the approval processes for the Relevant \nLoans.  \n412. In summary, the Intermediary Borrower SOFs demonstrate that, as with the Borrowers, \nthe Intermediary Borrowers were obviously wholly unsuitable as a sensible credit risk \nand had no prospect of repaying the very significant sums borrowed from any genuine \nbusiness activity.  It is also clear from this evidence that the Intermediary Loans were \nmade without any proper scrutiny by the ECC and that the security for them was either \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n103 \n non-existent or manifestly inadequate.  In the samples I considered, the ECC meetings \nat which they were approved were all chaired by Mr Dubilet and normally attended by \nthe same individuals (including as regular attendees Ms Gurieva, Mr Novikov, Mr \nGorokh ovsky, Mr Pikush, Ms Chmona and Mr Yatsenko).  In the samples I considered, \nthe purpose for which the Intermediary Loan was granted was either not disclosed or \nwas expressed in generic terms such as “financing current activities”.  The nature of the \nInterm ediary Borrower’s business was often wholly uninformative such as “Non -\nspecialized wholesale trade” and it was not unusual for the financial statements of the \nrelevant Intermediary Borrower to disclose that the obligations to be undertaken were \nbeyond the servicing capacity of the Intermediary Borrower concerned.  Furthermore, \nmany of the Intermediary Loans exceeded the US$2 million limit beyond which \napproval from the Supervisory Board was required, but there is no evidence that it was \never sought or given . \n413. I agree with the Bank’s submission that the available material gives strong support to a \nconclusion that none of the Intermediary  Loans was ever intended to be used for the \npurpose stated on the loan applications.  In my view they did not amount to genuine \nlending and I have no difficulty in concluding that the primary purpose relating to them \nwas to provide a paper trail which did n ot reflect the true nature of the relationship \nbetween the Bank and the Intermediary Borrowers which the applicable lending \ndocumentation purported to record.  The only function which it fulfilled was to disguise \nthe fact that transfers made to the Intermediary Borrowers were part of the loan \nrecycling scheme.  \n414. I shall return later to my conclusions about the interests which the Individual \nDefendants in fact had in the Intermediary Borrowers; my findings on that aspect of the \ncase are in part reached having considered the position of the Intermediary Borrowers \nin conjunction with that of the Borrowers and the Corporate Defendants.  But, as with \nwhat he had to say about the Borrowers, Mr Kolomoisky has admitted that, at various \nstages during the periods in which the Intermediary Loans were being made, he had an \ninterest in 17 of the 34 Intermediary Borrowers.  Most of them were small indirect \ninterests, but they ranged in size from nominal indirect stakes in relation to some of \nthem to a 50% interest in Autotradeinvest LLC (“Autotradeinvest”).

In order to put the Asset Transfers and the Transformation into their proper context, it \nis necessary to explain some of the developments in the Ukrainian banking sector \nduring the period between the end of 2013 and 2015 and the impact of those \ndevelopment s on the position of the Bank.  I shall also describe some of the events on \nwhich the Defendants rely as part of the Li mitation Defence, in large part because this \nenables the chronology of what occurred to be better understood.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n104 \n 416. In her evidence, Ms Rozhkova described how from late 2013 onwards, and throughout \n2014, Ukraine was experiencing what the Bank called severe political turmoil, \nincluding the February 2014 revolution of dignity and the Russian invasion and \nsubsequent annexu re of Crimea.  In April 2014 Ukraine entered into a US$17.1 billion \nstand -by arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (“IMF”), in return for \nwhich the IMF required Ukraine to make significant reforms to its regulatory structures, \nincluding in parti cular its banking sector.  The IMF’s concerns in connection with the \nUkrainian banking sector, more especially relating to the level of non -performing loans, \ncapital adequacy and the extent of related party lending by Ukrainian banks, was the \ncatalyst for new legislation designed to  facilitate the ability of banks to restore their \ncapital and liquidity over a period of time.  \n417. The first of the provisions to which my attention was drawn which dealt with this type \nof issue was the NBU’s resolution 540 dated 29 August 2014 (see paragraph 401 \nabove).  This led to a tightening up by the NBU of foreign currency purchase procedures \nand the maintenance of a register for that purpose.  Thereafter,  on 28 December 2014 \nthe Verkhovna Rada enacted Law 78 “on measures aimed at promoting the \ncapitalisation and restructuring of banks”.  This law was designed to introduce greater \nflexibility in the ability of the NBU to respond to banks in financial difficu lties.  It \nincluded a statutory obligation for a bank to produce a restructuring or recapitalisation \nplan rather than requiring the NBU to declare a bank insolvent immediately in the event \nthat a study showed that it did not meet the legal requirements re garding its capital \nadequacy.  \n418. The effect of this legislation was to provide all Ukrainian banks with a period of time \nin which to resolve their problems.  However, in the event that a bank failed to provide \na plan to meet the NBU’s requirements, Law 78 required the NBU either to declar e a \nbank insolvent or to submit a proposal for a solvent nationalisation of the bank through \na state funded recapitalisation programme.  Ukraine also enacted new legislation in \nMarch 2015 in relation to related party lending (Law 218  amending Article 52 of  the \nLaw on Banks  (“Article 52”) ), which contained more detailed tests to be applied for \nassessing whether persons or legal entities were related to the bank in question .

It was \ndesigned to close what the IMF had called legal and regulatory “loopholes” . It listed \nnine key categories of related party, and also provided for NBU regulations to set out \nadditional criteria for relatedness in due course . \n419. These new laws were followed up with a series of resolutions of the NBU concerned \nwith the application of new stress -tests for banks (Resolution 260 dated 15 April 2015) \nand the introduction of reporting obligations in relation to related parties (Resoluti ons \n314 and 315  dated 12 May 2015), and the reduction in the acceptable ratios for related \nparty lending (Resolution 312 also dated 12 May 2015).  The fact that these changes \nwere driven by the IMF  was confirmed  by Ms Rozhkova  who said that the  \n“requiremen ts in relation to stress tests and related parties were required by the IMF to \nbring the regulation of the banking sector into line with international standards, and \nultimately to protect the integrity of the Ukrainian financial system”.   \n420. Meanwhile, and before this new legislation had been introduced, the liquidity crisis at \nthe Bank had begun to become more apparent.  This was illustrated by the fact that, on \n17 July 2014, Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Dubilet, as chairmen of the Supervisory Board \nand the Management Board respectively, wrote to Ms Gontareva  (recently appointed \nas Governor of the NBU)  expressing concerns about customer withdrawals and seeking \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n105 \n a two -year stabilisation loan in the amount of UAH 2,285 million.  It also expressed \nconcern about the number of borrowers asking for extensions of their loan repayment \nterms as a result of reductions in cash flows and working capital.  In light of Mr \nBogo lyubov’s case that he had very little involvement in the Bank’s affairs at this time, \nit is striking that he was a party to this letter which betrayed a detailed understanding \nof the Bank’s liquidity crisis and what were asserted to be the reasons for it.  \n421. A number of events relevant to these proceedings occurred against this background.  \nThus, as I have already explained, in September 2014 the active phase of the \nMisappropriation came to an end and the Borrowers commenced the 2014 Ukrainian \nProceedings.  It  was also around this time that the Gurieva Spreadsheet (the significance \nof which I have explained in paragraph 385 and 386 above) was produced.  \n \nThe 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings  \n422. I now turn to the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings  which are said by the Bank to have been \ncommenc ed for the purposes of disguising the true nature and purposes of the transfers \nwhich formed part of  the loan recycling  scheme.   Between 11 September 2014 and 14 \nNovember 2014, i.e., commencing shortly after the last Unreturned Prepayment was \nmade  (and on the same day that the last of the RSA Pledges was entered into) , 46 of the \nUkrainian  Borrowers commenced  claims in the Economic Court of Dnepropetrovsk and \nin three cases  arbitration proceedings against one or other of the Corporate Defendants  \nseeking ret urn of the money due from the Corporate Defendants .  The four Borrowers \nwho did not commence proceedings  were Prominmet and the three Cypriot  Borrowers , \nbecause they had not entered into RSAs with any of the Corporate Defendants . \n423.

The Bank was a party to all of the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings because the Borrowers \nalso sought to invalidate the relevant RSA Pledge entered into between  the Borrower \nand the Bank.  The first claims were brought by Alfatrader against Collyer and by \nRaneya LLC and Rapit against Trade Point Agro.   The basis of each claim was a \ncomplaint that the relevant Corporate Defendant had failed to supply goods under an \nRSA.  The Borrowers  obtained judgment in these claims on various dates between 7 \nOctober 2014 (when  judgment was entered against Collyer in favour of Alfatrader , one \nof the Ukrainian Borrowers ) and 24 December 2014. \n424. On 16 September 2014 two a rbitration proceeding s were  commenced in the \nInternational Commercial Arbitration Court at the Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce \nand Industry  by two of the Borrowers (Gardera and Tamersa ) against Collyer and Trade \nPoint Agro  respectively.   A further arbitration proceeding was commenced against \nTrade Point Agro on 2 October 2014 .  These led  to arbitration awards in favour of the \nBorrower s in the early part of 2015 .  The Bank was not a party to the arbitration \nproceedings.  \n425. In each case , the Corporate Defendants accepted liability and judgment was entered for \nrepayment of the sums received by way of prepayments under the relevant RSA.  None \nof these judgments has ever been enforced.  In many of these cases, the judgment \nrecorded that the relevant proceeding was preceded  by a letter from the relevant \nCorporate Defendant asserting  that it was unable to perform its obligations , followed \nby a response from the Borrower stating that it was terminating the RSA and seeking \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n106 \n repayment and concluding with an addendum to the relevant RSA requiring the relevant \nCorporate  Defendant to refund the Borrower the amount of the prepayment .  The RSAs \nwere also amended to include provision for all disputes to be “settled on the territory of \nUkraine”.   \n426. The documentation  referred to on the face of the judgments in the 2014 Ukrainian \nProceedings was executed as the Bank submitted, “by following a well -trodden path ”.  \nThe process was that PBC sent drafts  to Primecap, w hich Primecap then passed to the \nrelevant Cypriot CSP, which then executed the document ation and  returned it to \nPrimecap.  Once that process was complete, proceedings were issued.   All of these steps \nwere therefore taken in collaboration between those acting on both sides of what was \nintended t o give the impression of being a genuine legal dispute , and there was no sign \nthat any part of this process  involved an independent arms -length negotiation.   \n427. The Bank therefore contend ed that the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings were an artificial \nconstruct procured and pursued in collusion between, amongst others, the Borrowers \nand the Corporate Defendants.   It was said that they were brought in reliance upon sham \ndocumentation created especially for use in the claims .  They were not pursued for any \ngenuine purpose of enforcement, but rather to avoid the Borrowers incurring fines for \nbreach of the ‘90 -day’ rule  and to make it appear that the Borrowers had a plausible \nexcuse for not repaying the  Relevant Loans.   Quite apart from the collaborative \napproach adopted by the parties to the preparation of the documentation for making the \nlegal claims , one of the more striking aspects of what occurred is that the Bank itself , \nat the instigation of Mr Melnyk and employees of BOK  (such as Mr Kazantsev  and \nTetyana Gubanova) , funded the  Borrowers to pursue the 2014 Ukrainian P"}

The way that the Bank put the point in its opening submissions was that the judgments  \nand arbitration awards obtained in the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings  were no more than \n“pieces of paper that could be shown to the regulator or auditor if they asked why the \nUnreturned Prepayments were outstanding and in order to avoid the  Borrowers \nincurring punitive charges under Ukrainian foreign currency control regulations ” and \nthat they were issued to cover up the Misappropriation and evade scrutiny from the \nNBU .  Counsel for Mr Kolomoisky submitted that , whether or not that was the \nintention, they did nothing of the sort.   It was  said that, on the contrary, the 2014 \nUkrainian Proceedings had precisely the o pposite effect, because not only did the \nreceipt of claims by the Bank reveal the violation s of the Bank’s rights  to people within \nthe Bank who did not already know about them  but, when judgments  were given, they \nwere reported on the unified register of court decisions  which was a publicly accessible \nsource of information.  \n429. I think that there is substance in th e submission s made by the Ba nk on this point.  I have \nconcluded that  the clear inference from the surrounding circumstances is that the 2014 \nUkrainian Proceedings  were not designed to secure genuine recovery for the Borrowers \nor the Bank .  They were collusively obtained and were intended to avoid the currency \ncontrol penalties referred to above and to furnish the Bank with evidence (capable of \nbeing supplied to the NBU as its regulator) to explain why the Relevant Loans had not \nbeen repaid.   But I also think that there is substance in what the Defendants had to say \nabout them as well .  Anyone within the Bank who had seen the Borrowers’ statements \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n107 \n of claim, but who did not know about the structure of the Misappropriation , must have \nappreciated that there was something wrong with  the 2014  Ukrainian Proceedings and \nthat the form they had taken did not accurately reflect  what had occurred.  \n \nGlavcom , the LIGABusinessInform Interview  and the GPO investigation  \n430. There was also some important publicity in relation to  what may have occurred as part \nof the Misappropriation, which is relevant to the Limitation Defence .  On 4 November \n2014, t he Chief editor of a  Ukrainian media website called Glavcom wrote  to the Bank’s \npress officer with a request to comment on  information it had obtained concerning loans \nto 42  of the Bank’s  borrowers .  Glavcom’s information came from the court’s unified \nregister of judgments database , i.e. the available public  information generated by  the \n2014 Ukrainian Proceedings .  His letter  included  a list of the 42 Borrowers , together \nwith a list  the Corporate Defendants identifi ed as the relevant Suppliers and the loan \namounts .  He asked  eight questions  relating  to why the Borrowers were seeking to \nterminate the Bank’s rights under the RSA Pledges with particular reference to the \nrelationship between loans by the Bank to the Borrowers and a number of refinancing \nloans which had been advanced to the Bank by the NB U during the course of the year.   \nThey included question s as to ho"}

The e -mail correspondence between Glavcom and the Bank was copied to Mr Dubilet \nand to a number of other senior members of the Bank’s management, some of whom \ncontinued in a senior position after the Bank’s nationalisation.   They included Mr \nLinskiy . The reference to refinancing loans advanced by the NBU related to a \nsignificant aspect of the criticism which Glavcom directed at the Bank.  These loans \ncontinued to be advanced by the NBU after the time at which the Relevant Drawdowns \nand the making of th e Un returned Prepayments had ceased.  \n432. On 7 November 2014, i.e., after most of the Ukrainian Proceedings had been \ncommenced and judgment had been entered in favour of a number of the Borrowers, \nGlavcom published an article  (the “Glavcom Article”) written by Fedor Orishchuk \nentitled “Did Kolomoisky withdraw UAH 11 billion from Ukraine? ”  It was said in Mr \nKolomoisky’s  closing submission s on the Limitation Defence  that this joined all the \ndots together  and that the allegation s made in the Glavcom Article were too topical, too \nserious and the details too specific to have been ignored.  The Glavcom  Article referred  \nto “three dozen” claims brought by 30 borrowers against suppliers  in the Ukrainian \ncourts and contained alleg ations  that prepayments had been made to foreign suppliers \nfor goods which had not been delivered . \n433. The Glavcom Article also  suggested that the Bank’s chances of obtaining compensation \nfor losses were close to zero , as the collateral for the issued loans w ere goods which did \nnot exist .  A table list ed a number of the Borrowers and all six of the Corporate \nDefendants (as Suppliers ) being the subject of the proceedings referred to .  The \nGlavcom A rticle suggest ed that they were all related to the Privat group and/or Mr \nKolomoisky .  As Ms Rozhkova confirmed in her oral evidenc e, everyone in Ukraine \nknew that the Privat group was associated with Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n108 \n and that the Glavcom Article would have been understood by any reader  to be saying \nthat the money had gone to Mr Kolomoisky or his companies.   The way that Mr \nKolomoisky ’s closing submissions described what was being said in the Glavcom \nArticle was that “In other words, the money had gone, the Bank would bear the cost \nand the  beneficiaries were probably the owners of the Bank ”.  I agree that it is likely \nthat any reader of the Glavcom Article would have reached this conclusion.  \n434. I shall have more to say about  the Glavcom Article when explaining my conclusions on \nthe Limitation Defence, but it was widely circulated  within the Bank and also came to \nthe attention of KPMG  who, although not the Bank’s statutory auditors, had been \nappoint ed in May 2014  to conduct a “diagnostic check” at the insistence of the NBU.   \nThis was apparent from the fact that, on 12 November 2014, Tetyana Kotenko, an audit \nmanager at KPMG , sent an e -mail to  Ms Korotina (copied to Mr Vetluzhskikh  and to \nOlga Kuche r, the  deputy head of the Bank’s internal audit department) about the \nGlavcom Article.

This was the n copied on to Mr Pikush, the deputy chair  of the \nManagement Board responsible pre -nationalisation for compliance  and Ms \nShmalchenko, another deputy chair  of the Management Board pre -nationalisation and \ndirector of treasury . \n435. On Mr Pikush’s instructions  the e -mail correspondence initiated by KPMG was then \nsent on  by Mr Vetluzhskikh  to Mr Linskiy , apparently on the basis that he was \ninstructed to identify the people in the Bank who had access to the relevant information. \nThis was said by him to be a problem  on the basis that the  information could have been \nheld and disclosed  by individuals in a number of departments  within the Bank, \nincluding accounting, IT, finance & risk , business employees, internal audit and risk \nmanagement.  He also identified that possible external source s of information for \nGlavcom had been the Bank’s former and current auditors, the NBU and key workers \nof the NBU .  Mr Linskiy then forwarded the exchange to Svetlana Dudko, stating “read \nit, don’t forward it to anyone, we’ll talk”.  \n436. The correspondence made clear that Mr Vetluzhskikh  regarded the issue s ventilated in \nthe Glavcom Article  as serious  and said that  “decisions on the comments should \nprobably be made at the top management level ”.  However, it is also of significance \nthat the purpose of the exercise was to get to the bottom of who might have  leaked the \ninformation to Glavcom , rather than whether the allegations themselves were accurate.   \nThis is consistent with the fact that the thrust of what was said in the Glavcom Article \ncame as no surprise to the Bank’s senior management . \n437. The matters with which the Glavcom Article were concerned  were also referred to at \nsome length in a LigaBusinessInform journalist’s interview with Ms Gontareva on 11 \nNovember 201 4 when she was asked whether the Bank would be fined for withdrawing \nUAH 11 billion from the country through fictitious import contracts .  Ms Rozhkova \naccepted that LigaBusiness Inform ’s respectab ility as a  news outlet  was “not bad” .  At \nthis stage Ms Gontareva summarised the NBU’s reaction  to what appeared to have \noccur red as follow s: \n“I have not seen  PrivatBank ’s operation to withdraw  UAH 11 billion. So far, I have \nseen in it like other banks, only an outflow of  deposi ts. And I did not see  that Privat \ndelayed at least one payment.  To date , I have no complaints about Privat.”  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n109 \n 438. In the context of the L imitation Defence , the Defendants and Mr Kolomoisky in \nparticular, submitted that this statement by Ms Gontareva reflected only the NBU’s \npublic position.   It was said that, as the NBU’s governor, she would in fact have seen \nmany more concerns about the Bank’s lending practices, which meant that what she \nwas prepared to say in public was not an accurate reflection of the totality of the NBU’s \nunderstanding of what had or might have occurred.  \n439.

She said that she could not remember whether she was aware of this article at \nthe time, but pointed out that at that stage she did not work for the NBU.  Mr \nOleksiyenko and Ms Pakhachuk were also cross -examined about whether they \nremembered seeing the Glavcom Article at the time.  They both said that they had no \nspecific memory of seeing these articles at the time of publication although neither of \nthem w as with the Bank at the time (they only joined on nationalisation, just over two \nyears later).  Ms Pakhachuk initially said that she had not seen the Glavcom A rticle \nbefore she was sho wn it by the Bank’s lawyers, but then clarified that it was probably \namongst the papers which she was asked to read shortly after her appointment at the \nend of 2016.  Mr Oleksiyenko accepted that it was likely that the journalist must have \nhad sources from  within the Bank in order to write the article that he did, but was unable \nto give any specific evidence as to whom it might have been seen by at the time of its \npublication.  \n440. On 13 November 2 014, the General Prosecutor’s Office (“GPO”) instituted a pre -trial \ninvestigation  relating to what was later described by the investigator judge of the \nPechersk District Court of Kyiv as “the taking by officials of the  [Bank] of someone \nelse’s  property  - state funds of the [NBU] , allocated for refinancing  in especially large \namounts ”.  This was then followed up in early January 2015 by a dispute between the \nGPO and the Bank’s legal department , as to the GPO’s entitlement to  disclosure of \ndocuments relating to the NBU’s refinancing of the Bank during 2014 “including \ncontracts, orders, decrees, resolutions, protocols, audit repo rts, cash flow statements, \nlist of assets of [the Bank] which were adopted by the [NBU] as collateral” .  The Bank \ntook the position that the GPO had not complied with the rules of the Criminal \nProcedure Code and was not therefore entitled to the documentation  sought . \n441. Against that background , and throughout the rest of 2014 and into 2015 , the Bank \ncontinued to be in  detailed  negotiation with the NBU in relation to  its own financial \nposition and the pressing need to restructure its balance sheet , including the provision  \nof a UAH 3.64 billion refinancing loan by the NBU which required repayment \nschedules to be certified by both of the Individual Defendants and the provision of \nsecurity over their respective shares in Borivazh LLC, an entity of which they each held \n17.5% .  The NBU also continued to take a close interest in the Bank for a number of \nother  reasons .  On 8 January 2015, it made an order for an inspection of the Bank for \nthe period 1 May 2014 to 12 January 2015 regarding the fulfilment of its obligations \nunder its stabilisation loan.

The standard scheme looked like this. A PrivatBank -related firm \nreceived  a loan from PrivatBank, and loan funds remained in the same bank \naccount. The firm then entered into an agreement with a UK company to purchase \na product (the name of the product is non -substantial) for tens of millions of dollars. \nA few days after this de al, the firm transferred a 100 percent pre -payment to the \nUK company into a PrivatBank Cyprus branch account. Only after that, the \nUkrainian firm en tered into an agreement with PrivatBank to secure the previously \ngranted loan by proprietary rights to undelivered products from the UK firm.   After \nthat, the UK firm reported that it was unable to complete the supply and terminated \nthe deal with the Ukrainian firm without returning the money received. That’s how \nin May -August, USD 1.8 billion was transferred from  PrivatBank to PrivatBank \nCyprus branch.”  \n443. The focus of the NashiGroshi  Articles was on breach of the currency exchange \nregulations by siphoning money abroad,  and contained amongst other things an attack \non the NBU for the manner in which it had responded to the initial Glavcom disclosures  \nand a description of the interview given by Ms Gontar eva to L igaBusinessInform .  But \nit was clear from the  first NashiGroshi  Article that the allegation of “siphon ing off” was \nmade because the recipients of the loans had what were called “PrivatBank Roots” .  In \nthe second NashiGroshi  Article , there was a more specific allegation that the siphoning \noff was achieved by Mr Kolomoisky himself  and there was more detail of the nature of \nthe connections between the Borrowers, the Su ppliers and Mr Kolomoisky.  \n444. The publication of the NashiGroshi  Article s led to a request from the NBU to Mr \nDubilet, asking for  documents and written explanations to be provided in relation to the \nlending to the 42 Borrowers identified in the NashiGroshi  Articles (“Request 27”).   This \nrequest , which was  made on 12 February 2015, was made as part of the inspection \nwhich had been in progress since early January.   It received relatively widespread \nattention within the Bank and caused  Mr Luchaninov (acting on the instructions of Mr \nPikush ) to initiate an internal investigation  into what he called “possible information \nleakage and unlawful disclosure of bank secrecy in connection with ” the NashiGroshi  \nArticles .  It was recognised in the internal correspondence that th e instructions from Mr \nPikush based on Request 27 were  concerned with what were called “shareholder \ncompanies”, a rela tively obvious reference to the writer ’s belief that the companies \nconcerned belonged to the Individual Defendants.  As with Mr Linskiy’s investigation \nin relati on to the Glavcom Article, t his was the refore focused on how the  information \nhad come into the public domain, rather than whether there was any truth in the \nNashiGroshi  allegation that Mr Kolomoisky had procured the misappropriation of \nUS$1.8 billion from the Bank by siphoning off the money overseas.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n111 \n 445.

The \nunderlying documentation was not supplied , but one of the annexes to Mr Dubilet’s \nresponse to Request 27 gave generic descriptions (and loan and collateral agreement \nnumbers) of what were said to be 612 items of security granted in support of t he lending  \nto the 42 Borrowers . \n446. In his witness stat ement , Mr Luchaninov said that  he then had a meeting with Mr \nYatsenko, Ms Gurieva and Mr Pikush at some stage in  March 2015 which he \nremembered well because it was unusual for him to have a meeting with all three of \nthem  together .  At that  meeting,  he was provided with a list of the 42 Borrowers and \nwas asked to analyse whether there were any connections evident from the client \ninformation held by the Bank that would link  them to Mr Kolomoisky and Mr \nBogolyubov .  He was then asked, if any  such connections were evident, to provide \nguidance on how those connections  could be removed.   His recollection was t hat the \ninstruction  was prompted by an investigation that had  been launched by the Ukrainian \ncriminal authorities into the 42 Borrowers , an investigation which he ha d also seen \nreferred to in press articles at the time.   There was no evidence of a criminal \ninvestigation at this stage and Mr Luchaninov confirmed in his oral evidence (see \nbelow) that this was a reference to the conduct discussed in the NashiGroshi  Articles .  \nThe way that the Bank characterised this instruction was not that Mr Luchaninov should \nobtain the information required to report truthfully back to the NBU and  tell the m what \nparties were related or not related , but that he was being  instructed by Mr Pikush , Ms \nGurieva  and Mr Yatsenko to \"bury it ” and to  “sever the  connections\".  \n447. The NBU continued to probe in relation to the questions raised by the NashiGroshi  \nArticles and whether the  Bank had been complying with the relevant currency laws and \nregul ations .  On 24 March 2015 a further unscheduled on-site audit of the Bank was \ndirected by the NBU  “on certain issues related to compliance with the requirements of \ncurrency laws and regulations of the [NBU ] during foreign exchange transactions on \nbehalf of its customers ”.  The addendum to the inspector’s notice of appointment listed \nthe 42 Borrowers .  The following day the inspectors requested copies of a wide range \nof documents relating to their accounts and to the loans made to them.   The procedures \nfor providing those documents to the NBU were then agreed between Mr Luchaninov \nand Mr Yatsenko.  \n448. The inspectors’ next request for documentation relating to the 42 Borrowers \ndemonstrated a shift in focus from the aspects of the NashiGroshi  Articles which were \nconcerned with breaches of the foreign currency regulations to informati on relating to \nthe question of their possible related -party status .  The request was made on 30 March \n2015 and the Bank was required to respond within two days.  This caused Mr Pikush to \ninstruct Mr Luchaninov to prov ide the information sought  regarding  the Bank’s insiders \nand related parties  as at 1 March 2015 . \n449. Subsequ ent to this request , Mr Luchaninov wrote  an e-mail on 31 March 201 5 to Mr \nPikush, copied to Mr Yatsenko and Mr Novikov , which has been called the Luchaninov \ne-mail.

Taking into account that there \nis a risk of the loan transactions being linked to refinancing and to parties related \nto the bank, the document contains proposals to remove such ties. ” \n“Hello, in reference to the unplanned audit by the National Bank of Ukraine of 42 \nclients who previously received loans from PrivatBank and made advance \npayments under international contracts, the attached file contains a preliminary \nanalysis of the struct ure of connections of these loan clients. Considering that there \nis the risk of connections of lending operations to refinancing and persons related \nto the bank, the document provides suggestions on the removal of such \nconnections.”  \n450. The enclosures to this e -mail gave details of the relationships between 24 of the Bank’s \nclients , each of which was one of the Ukrainian Borrowers , which Mr Luchaninov \ncalled “the companies being inspected” .  Ea ch of the 24 Borrowers was said to be  a \nrelated party to the Bank because  it shared a director , chair  or member of the \nsupervisory board  in common with another entity in which  both of the Individual \nDefendants held a materia l interest (in most cases 50/50) .  Mr Luch aninov’s proposal \nor suggestion to deal with the risk of the loan transactions being linked to “refinancing \nand to parties related to the [B]ank”  was said to be to remove the relevant individual \nfrom their position as director or member of the supervisory board of either the relevant \nBorrower or the other relevant entity.   There was evidence tha t most , although not all , \nof these individuals were employees of PBC  and many of them were identified as \nnominees for the Individual  Defendants in relation to other as pects of their asset \ndisclosure in these proceedings .   \n451. The Bank relied on the Luchaninov e -mail as confirmation that four members of the \nManagement Board (Mr Pikush, Mr Novikov, Mr Yatsenko and Ms Gurieva) , each of \nwhom had a close relationship with the Individual Defendants, were complicit in \ndirecting an exercise for the conceal ment of connections between Mr Kolomoisky and \nMr Bogolyubov on the one hand  and 24 of the Borrowers  on the other .  It was said that \nif that concealment had not occurred, the closeness of the connection would have been \napparent from the Bank’s recorded client information.   It was also said that t he \nconcealment  was done on an industrial scale , because the 24 Borrowers had a total \naggregate indebtedness to the Bank of almost US$620 million .

Ms Montgomery  took the lead in a challenge to the significance of the Luchaninov e -\nmail.  There were two strands to this.  The first is that there is no evidence that Mr \nBogolyubov  himself took any steps to hide  his affiliations with the Borrowers from the \nNBU.  The second is that the Luchaninov e -mail was just an example of Bank \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n113 \n employees taking steps to  alter the connections between the Borrowers themselves in \norder to comply with the required credit risk ratios on related party lending.   It was said \nthat this was quite different from any organised effort to hide the links between the \nBorrowers and the Individual Defendants and t hat the Luchaninov e -mail was just one \naspect of  promoting a process of borrower disaffiliation , in order to avoid credit risk \nconcentration problems , a process which had been ongoing  since June 2014 if not \nearlier . \n453. It is certainly the case that the  papers contain  a number of examples of instances in \nwhich Mr Luchaninov  (as the Bank’s head of compliance)  was expressing concern \nabout  affiliations between groups of borrower s which were capable of affecting credit \nrisk concentration rates for insiders . This was also not the first occasion on which the \nBank’s compliance department had had to deal with the NBU’s concerns about the \nBank’s related party lending , including criticisms of the Bank’s internal procedures on \nthis s ubject.  Thus, I was shown an earlier report produced as a result of an NBU \nscheduled inspection dating from August 2014 in which the inspectors had concluded \nthat “There is a high level of insider lending, as documented by credit risk numbers \ncalculated based on the aud it findings, which has an adverse effect on Bank capital”.  \nThe Individual Defendants were both identified as insiders for this purpose, but the list \nof related parties identified a much smaller number of entities than were subsequently \nto be identified by the NBU.  \n454. It is also the case that one of the translations of the second enclosure to the e -mail opens \nwith langua ge which is consistent with credit risk concentration being a concern , \nreferring as it does to “risk -relevant relations ” and “violations of ratios”  (although the \nother one refers to “non -compliance”) .  But the core of Mr Bogolyubov’s submission \nwas founded on the proposition that  the Luchaninov e -mail simply evidences that \ncertain of the Borrowers were related to the Bank on the basis that  a director of a \ncompany in which one or both of the Individual Defendants ha d an interest  was also a \ndirector of one  (or sometimes two) of the Borrowers .  It was said that this  is sufficient \nto give rise to a relat ed party connection because of the expansion of the definition of \nrelated party given effect earlier in March by  Article 52 , but the concern was limited to \nthis and had nothing to do with concealing the Individual Defendants’ links with the 42 \nBorrowers . \n455.

Ms Montgomery  also relied on the fact that , during the course of Mr Luchaninov’s \ncross -examination, he made what was described as a crucial concession  which was in \ncomplete contradiction to the Bank’s case.   The oral evidence was as follows:  \nQ.  So although your witness statement says this email was sent because of a \ncriminal investigation, the reality is  that this issue about the 42 clients had been \nevident to  you because of the press report in NashiGroshi ? \nA.  Yes.  \nQ.  As the email itself says, this is not about hiding related parties; this is again \nabout concentration of lending so as to reduce the groupings that might cause \ncapital ratio breaches?  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n114 \n A.  I did not clearly understand the question, but I can comment that this email was \na result of the request t o our department and after the meeting that took place i n the \nBank's office.  It is described in detail in my  witness statement.  \nQ.  It is, but you describe in your witness statement that  it is designed to hide \nconnections to Mr Kolomoisky and  Mr Bogolyubov, whereas I'm going to suggest \nit is designed to hide the interconnections at a different  level so that these parties \nare not grouped together for  the purpose of concentration of credit risk.  \nA.  Based on the analysis conducted, we provided information  as for the \nconnections with the clients and 24 out of 4 7 have been identified as related and \nalso some directives  have been defined through which these connections have  been \nformed.  \nQ.  Yes, exactly.  What is happening here is you are  identifying cross -connections \nbetween groups and seeking  to eliminate those cross -connections.  You're not \ntrying  to hide anything about Mr Kolomoisky or Mr Bogolyubov.  \nA.  Well, we're not hiding information about Mr Kolomoisky  or Mr Bogolyubov \nhere.  \n456. It followed  from this evidence , so Ms Montgomery  submitted, that the Luchaninov e -\nmail did not establish t he Bank’s case t hat those who gave instructions to Mr \nLuchaninov  went to significant lengths to conceal the Individual Defendants’ interests \nin the Borrowers and the Intermediary Borrowers from the NBU .  It also does not \nprovide evidence that Mr Bogolyubov owned or controlled all 24 Borrowers . \n457. I do not accept these submissions .  In particular I do not agree that the answer give n by \nMr Luchaninov in the passage I have cited from his cross -examin ation was a crucial \nconcession which was in complete contradiction to the Bank’s case.   Mr Luchaninov \nmaintained his evidence,  consistently with the documentation, that  the e -mail flowed \nfrom the investigations relating to the NashiGroshi  Articles, which did of course \nconcern criminal conduct (the ph rase used was “siphoned off” ) and had quite \nspecifically raised the issu e of whether the Borrowers were related parties to the Bank \nas a result of the interests that Mr Kolomoisky  had in them .  It was also not put to him \ndirectly that his evidence as to the instructions given to him at his meeting with Mr \nYatsenko, Ms Gurieva and Mr Pikush was mistaken.   \n458. In my view the last answer given by Mr Luchaninov in the citation I have set out above  \nwas simply a  confirmation that the Luchaninov e -mail and its enclosures did not in and \nof themselves amount to the  hiding  of information about the Individual Defendants  (see \nin particular the use of the word “here”) .

I do not think that  his answer can be read as \nconfirmation that facilitating the hiding of the connections between the Individual \nDefendants and the Borrowers did not , at least  in part , underpin the suggesti ons he made \nfor removing the “connections” or “ties”.  In short I do not think that Mr Luchaninov’s \noral evidence  is inconsistent with the purpose of the e -mail being to make suggestion s \nas to how the connections between Borrowers and persons related to the Bank could be \nremove d. \n459. In reaching this conclusion, I have in mind  the wording of the e -mail itself.  W hat was \ncalled “ the preliminary analysis of the structure of connection s of these loan clients” \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n115 \n was prepared as a result of the investigation organised by Mr Luchaninov on Mr \nPikush’s instructions in response to the  NashiGroshi  Articles , which itself led to the \nNBU’s investigation and request for further information .  As I have explained, the \nNashiGroshi  Articles  had been concerned with what appeared to be a  misappropriation \nfrom the Bank  involving  many of the Borrowe rs who had been claimants in the 2014 \nUkrainian Proceedings and all six of the Corporate Defendants , and suggested that all \nthe entities  involved were  related to the Privat group and/or Mr Kolomoisky .  The fact \nthat the aspects of the NashiGroshi  Articles which were concerned with the connections \nbetween the Borrowers and the Corporate Defendants on the one hand and the \nIndividual Defendants and the Bank on the other hand were central to the purpose of \nthe Luchaninov e -mail is clear from its last sentence, whichever of the two translations \nis used . \n460. It may be the case that the Bank would have had good reason to have been concerned \nabout  breaches of credit ratios at the level of interconnections between different groups \nof borrowers, but I think it is relevant  that t he Luchaninov e -mail make s no reference \nto that sort of concern .  I also agree with the Bank’s submission that it is significant that \nnone of the attachments analyse or even mention the outstanding balances on the loans \nof the Borrowers, which would have been an obvious  prerequisite for iden tifying \npotential credit ratio breaches.   This is also consistent with the fact that, at the time of \nthe Luchaninov e -mail, the 24 Borrowers, whose status as related parties was in issue \nas a result of the NashiGroshi  Articles, did not appear on the Bank’s related party lists.  \n461. In my view, the correct conclusion, which is more consistent with the surrounding \ncircumstances , is that  the related party connections with which the Luch aninov e -mail \nis concerned are the connections between the Borrowers and the Individual Defendants .  \nI also think that the Bank has established t hat it was self -evident to those concerned that \nit would be possible to make the interconnectivity less obvious by the simple expedient \nof procuring the change of the nominee directors of the Borrowers without reference to \nanyone independent of the Bank or the Individual Defendants .  I think that the Bank is \ntherefore correct to submit that the purpose of the e -mail was to recommend the steps \nto be taken to avoid the  24 Borrowers  being linked to the Individual Defendants via \ntheir directors, whose status as such d id appear on the Ukrainian corporate register, and \nwho also appeared on the public record of the members of the supervisory boards of the \nIndividual Defendants’ companies .

It was sent in response to the instruction given to \nMr Luc haninov to identify the connections between the Individual Defendants and the \ncompanies which were the subject of the NashiGroshi Articles  and to do what was \nnecessary to “shuffle the pack” (as Mr Anderson put it in closing) . \n462. The consequence of the Luchaninov e -mail was that in 22 out of 24 cases, the proposals \nin the Luchaninov e-mail were then implemented  over a period commencing at the \nbeginning of April 2015.  I n relation to three of the Borrowers  (Alfatrader, Vesta -\nCompany LLC  and Transmoloko ), the individual director of the Borrower was replaced \nin the course of 2015 .  In relation to the other 19 Borrowers, the individual director of \nthe Borrower was removed from their position on the supervisory board of the existing  \nackn owledged related party  or parties . \n \nThe related parties’ report s and the Rokoman Spreadsheet  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n116 \n 463. As Ms  Rozhkova explained , the measures required by the IMF and the World Bank had \nthe effect of revealing that the Bank was in fact significantly undercapitalised, which \nled to remedial actions being required.   This was confirmed  in a highly critical report \nsent to Mr Bogolyubov as chair man of the Supervisory Board and Mr Dubilet as \nchair man of the Management Boar d on 27 March 2015 a fter the NBU’s scheduled audit \nfor the period May 2011 to 2014 . The letter under cover of which it was sent  stressed \nthe unsat isfactory nature of the Bank’s financial standing .  It said that the Bank’s \nmanagement did not provide high -quality risk management  and that , as at 1 May 201 4, \nits regulatory capital was negative .  Amongst the  NBU’s  many detailed criticisms, was \na finding that the Bank  had “ uncontrolled and significant credit concentrations ”, a major \nloan impairment provision shortfall  and 77% of borrowers conducting unpro fitable \nactivities .  The report also criticised the Bank’s non -compliance with the disclosure \nrequirements relating to the indirect ownership interests of the Individual Defendants.  \n464. Taken as a whole , the report and its covering letter was excoriating in its criticism s of \nthe Bank  and its management , but, in the context of these proceedings, one of  the more \nstriking  comments related to  the collateral  it had for  loans in respect of which the report \nrecorded that “ 80% of the collateral accepted by the Bank for calculating loan \nimpairment provisions was rights to after -acquired goods to be delivered at a later date ”.  \nIt also proposed that the Supervisory Board and the Management Board tak e \n“appropriate disciplinary action against persons responsible for violations” and inform \nthe NBU accordingly .  It also gave the Bank a very low overall CAMELS rating . \n465. In the event, the Supervisory Board, on which both of the Individual Defendants sat , \ntook no action against those responsible for the violations identified in the NBU’s \nreport .  Indeed , at the next meeting held on 17 April 2015 the Supervisory Board \napproved the composition of the Management Board without any comment on the \nNBU’s report , while  the General  Meeting held on 27 April 201 5 adopted a very po sitive \ntone as to the conduct of the Bank’s affairs during the previous year .

The minutes of \nthe meeting  also recorded the following as a summary of the work which had been \ncarried out by the Supervisory Board, which there is no reason to consider was not an \naccurate reflection of  the extent of its members’ involvement in the Bank’s affairs : \n“In 2014, the Bank’s Supervisory Board held 40 meetings which reviewed issues \nsatisfies under the Bank’s Articles of Association that are within the competence \nof the Supervisory Board, and the Supervisory Board exercised management of \nfinancial flows and c ontrolled the work of the Management Board and the Bank as \na whole.  \n… \nIn 2015 the Supervisory Board will continue to engage in continuous control over \nthe implementation of the measures directed by the Board as of 2015 to improve \nand promote banking services. ” \n466. The Bank relied on this fact in support  of a submission that the court should infer that \nnothing was done becaus e the Individual Defendants knew perfectly well what the \nBank's senior management had been doing all along , because they had been directing it \nthemselves .  In general terms , and supported by the representations made in the minutes \nof the work which the Supervisory Board had been doing,  that is the right inference to \ndraw.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n117 \n 467. On 17 April 2015 , Mr Luc haninov sent another e -mail to  Ms Gurie va, Mr Yatsenko, \nMr Novikov and Mr  Pikush  entitled “Insiders ’ Related Parties” in which he made \nrecommen dations on how to minimise the appearance that apparent related parties \nshould be so characterised.   He recommended changes  to the offi cers of w hat were \ncalled the  ‘new insiders ’, identified by reference to a spreadsheet which included eleven \ncompanies and eight individuals whose offic ers were to be changed , and more than 100 \ncompanies , including a  number of Borrowers , in respect of which  ‘third ’ companies \nrelated to those new insiders were to have  their offic ers changed . \n468. On 15 May 2015, what the Bank called the NBU’s NashiGroshi  audit team reported \nback. They expressed concern about the  quality and liquidity of collateral for certain of \nthe 42 borrowers, they noted the decisions of the  courts in the 2014 Ukrainian \nProceedings and they indica ted the need for further credit reserves pointing out the risk \nthat loans would not be repaid .  The report also confirmed much of what had been said \nin the NashiGroshi Articles  about the way  in which the scheme had worked .  However , \nthe report also  concluded  that, although the majority of customers “interrelated to each  \nother according to the ownership  structure” the 42 Borrowers were not linked to the \nIndividual Defendants or other Bank insiders.  The way it was put was that “[n]o facts \nhave been found of relationships of the non -resident legal entities, the owners of the \nBranch’s customers, with the insiders and the Bank’s related parties .” \n469. At about the same time, on 23 May 2015 , the NBU appointed EY to prepare a related \nparties report  as at 1 April 2015  in accordance with Resolution 314.   The banking \nsector’s relationships with related parties was one of the principal issues about which \nthe IMF had expressed particular concern .

EY’s report was presented on 16 July 2015 (the “EY Related Parties Report”) and \nidentified significant problems with the Bank’s related party lending practices and \ncontrol systems.   It concluded that the Bank’s N9 prudential ratio ( the maximum credit \nrisk on transactions with related parties) was 89.5%.   Not only did this demonstrate an \nexceptionally high level of Bank lending to related parties, it was also in very obvious \nbreach of the  ratios required by Resolution 312 , which was a maximum of 25%.  The \nreport also explained how EY had  identified “59 companies (including 6 Cyprus \nborrowers), whose financial statements and accounts turnover have signs of \ninsignificant business activity from 1 April 2014 to 1 April  2015 ”. The Bank’s list of \nrelated parties was therefore materially incomplete and identified that these borrowers \nwere engaged in a “scheme” involving artificial loan servicing and financial aid through \nthe making of returnable prepayments.  \n471. In reaching that conclusion, these  borrowers were found by EY to have a number of the \nsame characteristics  including : the receipt of loans in foreign currency to pay for what \nwere called “external economic contracts ”, monies advanced by the Bank as virtually \nthe only source of funding  and financial statements which did not contain significant \nrevenue, trade receivables or inventorie s.  In each case,  loan monies  had been used as \nprepayment s for contracts  none of which ended with the delivery of goods , but in  \nrespect of which the prepayments were eventually cancelled  and returned to the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n118 \n borrowers  prior to August  2014, but  not returned thereafter .  During 2014 , interest on \nloans was serviced mainly by loans granted by the Bank, although  some of the \nborrowers paid interest from funds, the source of which EY were unable  to identify ; \ntheir activit ies during the period 2013 and 2014 were  unprofitable and did not generate \nsignificant revenues from operations .  The final common characteristic was that  it \nappeared that s hareholders of the borrowers were all  non-resident companies, with \nnominal directors as “UBOs” , or no record of  beneficiaries at all “if none of them has \nsubstantial ownership in the company .”   \n472. The NBU’s initial conclusions based on the EY Related Parties R eport were sent to the \nBank in a letter dated 31 July 2015 .  Ms Roz hkova said that the NBU took the view  that \n165 of the Bank’s customers which were not included on the Bank’s related party lists \nwere in fact related parties.  This included 28 Borrowers , all but three of which were  \nidentified as Type 529 related parties which as  Ms Rozhkova explained “encompassed \nentities and individuals through which transactions were enacted for the benefit of  other \nrelated parties, where such entities or individuals were influenced by the related party. \nIn essence, it targeted companies used to transit funds on behalf of a bank’s owners. ”  \nShe then went on to explain:  \n“In my experience, at the time, it was very common in the Ukrainian banking sector \nto create an SPV with unknown or obscure shareholders that could not easily be \nlinked with the shareholders of a bank. Such companies would then be used as a \nconduit for obta ining bank funding, and would"}

Such companies would then be used as a \nconduit for obta ining bank funding, and would funnel money as part of transactions \nin the interests of shareholders. Whilst the  corporate register might not show any \nlinks between the company and a bank’s owners, if flows of funds between the \ncompanies were properly anal ysed, it was often possible t o determine that the \ncompany was connected to many other entities, which were directly connected with \nthe owners. ” \n473. The Bank was then instructed to submit to the NBU no later than 1 September 2015  an \nupdated report on credit and lending transactions with its related parties, or what was \ncalled “justified evidence that the party is not related to the bank in accordance with \nspecified criteria and to provide duly certified documents”.   The categories of \ninformation and documentation to be provided w ere then listed . \n474. On the same day that the Bank received the EY Related Parties R eport , the deputy head \nof BOK, Liliya Rokoman , sent an e -mail to Ms Gurieva copied to Ms Lozytska entitled \n“Suggestions for disaffiliating the affiliated counterparties ”. The e-mail was as follows:  \n“Attachment contains two spreadsheets:  “counterparties group - suggestions for \ndirectors ” and “change of beneficiary owners ” \nAt the first stage we suggest replacing directors with new ones, which will allow \nto significantly reduce concentrations across all groups, and 15 groups will be \nnormalised. At the second stage, beneficiary owners should be changed , this \ninformation has already been provided.”  \n475. Ms Rokoman’s proposals were then developed during the course of the next few days \nand culminated in  the production at the beginning of August 2015 of two spreadsheets  \n(the “Rokoman Spreadsheets”) , one concerned with changing directors and the other \nentitled “Change of Beneficial Owners” .  So far  as the direct ors’ spreadsheet was \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n119 \n concerned,  it contained a list of directors of 82 companies under the heading of “Who \nto exclude”  and includ ed the directors of 22 Borrowers and 23 Intermediary Borrowers , \ninclud ing Uniks, in which both of the Individual Defendants have admitted to holding \na 100% beneficial ownership . \n476. The Rokoman Spreadsheet propos ing the changes to beneficial owners identifie d nine \nbenefic iaries of 31 offshore companies using a cypher in the form of an al pha-numeric \ncode . It was possible to decr ypt t he cypher by using a spreadsheet prepared in the \nBank’s Cyprus Branch on 8 May 2015  which g ave an alpha -numeric code to the \npurported beneficiar ies, each of whom was an employee of PBC  or the Ban k: B20 (Mr \nPerevizny i), B3 (Andriy Akudovich) , B8 (Andriy Kolobkov) , B32  (Artem Zamsha) , \nB17 (Mr Melnyk) , B29  (Ms Trykulych) , B14  (Sergei K ryvovyaz) , B19  (Gennad iy \nNikolenko)  and B11  (Ms Kravchenko) .  Amongst other information, t he Rokoman \nSpreadsheet s identifie d the companies of which each individual  was said to be a \nbeneficiary , the proposed replacement beneficiary  by reference to a furthe r alpha-\nnumeric code and the reduction in group debt which the change would produce (i.e. the \ndebt associated with a group of companies connected to a particular individual).  \n477.

However, i ts real significance as a document is that it records the way in \nwhich beneficial interest s in some of the Borrowers were held through offshore \ncompanies, purportedly owned by PBC and Bank employees  and how the Bank  was \nprepared to allow changes  in the ostensible ownership of the Bank’s borrowers to be \nmade so as to avoid breaching the related party  lending  limits  (both N7 and N9) .  I agree \nwith the Bank’ s submission that it was an obviously sensitive document, as  \ndemonstrated by the need to use an alpha -numeric code  to decrypt the names of \npurported beneficiaries .  I also agree that t he fact that employees of BOK w ere able to \npropose  and implem ent such changes confirms both the nominee status of the purported  \nbeneficial owners and the likelihood that the true beneficial owners were all the same \npeople , because otherwise the manipulation of ostensible beneficial ownership could \nnot have been carried  out in the manner proposed . \n478. At this stage there was further publicity in relation to the siphoning allegations that had \noriginally been made by Gla vcom in November 2014 and then followed up by \nNashiGroshi  in February 2015 .  On 20 August 2015 an  article entitled “The MVS and \nGPU are searching where Privat has placed almost UAH 2 0 billion of refinancing ” \nappeared on the daily .rbc.ua website , which described how t he GPO and the Ministry \nof Internal Affairs ha d been investigating for almost a year the case of the Bank  \n“siphoning abroad more than UAH 19 billion of refinancing ”.  This report seems to \nhave been based on a government minister’s answer to a request from a People’s Deputy  \nfor information about what were called possible unlawful actions by officials  of the \nBank relating to what was described as “seizure of funds received in the form of loans \nfor refinancing and stabilization loan, as well as on other issues” . \n479. The Government ’s response to the request for information was:  \n“We hereby inform that the Main Investigation Department of the Minis try \nconducts a pre -trial investigation in the criminal proceedings No. \n42014000000001261, commenced on 13.11.2014 by  the General Prosecutor’s \nOffice of Ukraine on the fact of seizure by individual Bank officials of NBU public \nfunds allocated for Bank refinancing in especially large amounts, on the grounds \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n120 \n of a crime provided for in Part 5 Article 191 (Embezzlement, misapplication or \nassimilation otherwise of  proper ty by abuse of official position) of the Criminal \nCode of Ukraine.  \n“To date, pre -trial investigation in the said criminal proceedings is ongoing. \nSuspicion of the commission of the crime was not served to anyone. ” \n480. The article on the daily.rbc.ua website went on to make the point  that pre -trial \ninvestigations were continuing and the investigators had been permitted by the court to \nfamiliarise themselves with original documents relating to the NBU refinancing .  It also \ndescribed the substance of the allegation as being that in 2014 the Bank “under pledge \nof property rights to the goods, issued loans in the amount of US$18-73 million to \nUkrainian (over 40) and foreign (over 50) companies  and these companies entered into  \ndubious agreements and transferred those funds to the accounts of  [the Corporate \nDefendants ] with 100% prepayment for the purpose of supposedly, receiving goods .”  \nHowever, the focus of the article was as much on the way in which the NBU had \nallowed public money to be used , which the Bank "}

There was then correspondence between the NBU and the Bank during the course of \nSeptember and October 2015 in which the Bank sought to persuade the NBU that a \nsignificant number of the 165 customers it had identified were not in fact related parties  \n(and indeed that only 33 were) .  It did so having received advice from Avellum Partners \n(“Avellum”) at the beginning of September as to how to remove links between the \ncompanies concerned and the Bank so that they were no longer “companies which \ntransact busines s in the interests of Bank insiders and over which Bank insiders have \ninfluence”.   It was said that the Bank would either have to “disclose the company \nownership structure all the way up to the beneficial owners” or would have to “adjust \nthe company’s ownership structure so that none of the group’s insiders have any \ninfluence over the company (by removing insiders from the ownership structure or \nreducing their ownership interests / stakes)”.   They even made the rather sur prising \nsuggestion that “ if the Bank  is not able to provide a sufficient number of new \nbeneficiaries to implement an ideal structure, it is possible to consider the acquisition \nof all Group 3 companies by one or several  beneficiaries on the same day ”. [empha sis \nin original ] \n482. However, Mr Luchaninov’s unchallenged evidence included an example of a rather less \nstraightforward approach .  On 6 October 2015 , Mr Dubilet commented by way of \nconcern that, if the draft NBU related party list for that month was approved with all of \nthe proposed customers included, the amount of the Bank’s lending to its related parties \nwould be too high.  Mr Luchaninov said that, in order to ensure that the Bank’s related \nparty lending was reduced sufficien tly (in that case below UAH 43 billion), Mr Dubil et \ngave an instruction which Mr Luchaninov construed as requiring companies to be \nremoved from the list until the sum of the Bank’s lending to the parties included in the \nlist was below that figure.  The Bank characterised this as manipulation of the draft  \nNBU related party list for that month, and I agree that this is what it was.  \n483. I also agree that the conduct of individuals within BOK and PBC during this period \nshows that  the proposals for  the removal  and replacement of directors and beneficial \nowners  of the Borrowers or Intermediary Borrowers was uninfluenced by  the position \nof any unconnected third part ies.  Such evidence as there is all supports the Bank’s case \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n121 \n that the nominee directors and purported UBOs  can properly be characterised as a \nfungible pool of individuals (mainly employed within PBC) who could be swapped as \nand when required.  \n484. Furthermore I consider that the Bank was correct to submit that t here were no genuine \nchanges of beneficial ownership  made during the course of th is process , and  that the \nindividuals concerned consistently eschewed the need to disclose that Mr Kolomoisky \nand Mr Bogolyubov were in fact  the true UBOs  of many if not all of the entities \nconcerned .

In the event, and despite the processes which had been put in place by PBC \nand the Bank, the NBU’s eventual conclusion was that 136 of the 165 entities that had \noriginally been identified as related parties were correctly classified as such.   The list \nof 136 inc luded 21 Borrowers and eight Intermediary Borrowers.  On 15 December \n2015, the NBU notified the Bank of those conclusions.  \n \nThe Restructuring Plan and the proposal for the Asset Transfer s \n485. Also on 15 December 2015, the NBU published its final report on Outcomes of the \nDiagnostic Study of the Bank as of 1 April 2015.  Like the conclusions on related part y \nlending, this report had been in the course of preparation throughout the late summer \nand autumn of 2015, with Mr Kolomoisky initially being warned in September 2015 by \nMs Gontareva  that the “amounts are huge”: the amount she indicated was UAH 120 \nbillion.  In the report, the NBU concluded that the Bank was unlikely to be able to \nenforce the pledges over contractual rights in light of the collateral identified in the \nsamples analysed.  It concluded that 90% of the collateral sampled consisted of property \nrights to receive goods under supply contracts and that there was a high risk of the Bank \nbeing unable to satisfy its claims against this collateral, noting that the contracts had \nnot been performed and that there was no evidence of the Suppliers’ ability t o provide \nthe goods.  \n486. The report also identified (a) a serious deterioration in the servicing of the Bank’s \ncorporate lending portfolio, (b) loss -making operations for the majority of the Bank’s \ncorporate borrowers and (c) pervasive financing of debt through further lending and the \nextension of repayment deadlines.  The NBU’s consequential conclusion was that the \nBank needed additional capital of an amount in excess of UAH 113 billion (the US$ \nequivalent of which was then c.US$4.8 4 billion) in order to comply with the applicable \ncapital adequacy ratio.  (This figure was formally approved later, by resolution of the \nNBU dated 14 January 2016. ) \n487. In the letter under cover of which the report was sent to the Bank, the NBU required \nthe Bank to prepare a realistic capitalisation program me to guarantee compliance with \nthe applicable regulatory capital adequacy ratios  by 1 January 2016.  In order to meet \nthis deadline, the NBU requested the Bank to submit a plan  for consideration by 25 \nDecember 2015.  The precise time is not apparent from the evidence, but sometime \naround this period, Ms Rozhkova described how she had met with Mr Kolomoisky to \ndiscuss th e results of the stress testing.  She explained to him that, in circumstances in \nwhich the IMF’s requirements were that all banks should achieve a positive value of \ncapital by 1 January 2016 and a N2 capital adequacy ratio of 5% by 1 June 2016, the \nBank needed to comply with the timelines which  had been discussed.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n122 \n 488. The Bank’s initial proposals as to how that would be achieved were sent by Mr Dubilet \nto the NBU in a letter dated 24 December 2015, which included proposals in relation \nto improving loan security and what he called changes in the portfolio structure.  Mr \nDubilet described what he referred to as “confirmation from shareholders”, by which  \n(despite argum ent to the contrary) I think  he must have meant both of the Individual \nDefendants, which had caused the Bank to consider it realistic to reduce the portfolio \nof affiliated parties to the level set by the norm by 31 December 2016.

Mr \nDubilet described what he referred to as “confirmation from shareholders”, by which  \n(despite argum ent to the contrary) I think  he must have meant both of the Individual \nDefendants, which had caused the Bank to consider it realistic to reduce the portfolio \nof affiliated parties to the level set by the norm by 31 December 2016.  It proposed to \ndo this “by repayment of loans and placing of collateral assets on the balance sheet”.  \nThe letter also specifically referred to the use of shareholders’ funds in order  to improve \nthe Bank’s capital position.  This reference was to a proposal to recapitalise the Bank \nfrom the possible future proceeds of arbitration proceedings against the state of Ukraine \nfor breach of the Energy Charter  Treaty .  Those proceedings had be en brought by \ncompanies through which the Individual Defendants both held minority but material \ninterests in PJSC Ukrnafta.   \n489. On 31 December 2015, the NBU wrote to the Bank welcoming its commitment to \nbringing the volume of related party lending within the applicable regulatory ratios by \nthe end of 2016.  However, it went on to explain that the probable future proceeds from \nlitigation were ineligible as a source of new capital and said that the proposed measures \nwould only partially meet the need for additional capital.  It stressed that the NBU \nrequired a realistic restructuring plan for the Bank, which would guarantee compliance  \nwith the necessary capital adequacy ratios to be submitted by a postponed capitalisation \nprogramme date of 1 February 2016.  \n490. There were then negotiations between the NBU and the Bank during the course of \nJanuary and February 2016 in which the question of transferring assets from borrowers \nto the Bank’s balance sheet (including proposals for valuing such property) were \ndebated.  This included a letter from Ms Rozhkova to Mr Dubilet  dated 21 January \n2016, asking the Bank to finalise its plans for re -capitalisation before  25 January 2016 \nand to consider the possibility of obtaining additional collateral  to cover credit risk of \nUAH 50.1 billion , reducing loan concentrations to related parties, accepting borrowers’ \nproperty onto the balance sheet of the Bank in the amount  of UAH 31 billion , converting \nsubordinated debt , obtaining shareholders’ contributions and “other measures”.  Mr \nDubilet was the Bank’s immediate point of contact with the NBU, but it is clear from \nthe documents (and indeed the very nature of the NBU’s requirements) that both of the \nIndividual Defendants participated in and were aware of the proposals to be made to \ndeal with the NBU’s concerns in the same way that they must have been aware of the \nproposals presented by Mr Dubilet in his December letter.   \n491. This was then followed by  a letter from Mr Dubilet dated 29 January 2016 in which he \nproposed that collateral for large loans totalling UAH 107.8 billion would be registered \non the Bank’s books and records, as to UAH 45 billion by 1 April 2016 and as to UAH \n62.8 billion by 1 September 2016.  Mr Dubilet’s letter also referred to the fact that the \nBank’s shareholders, i.e. again both of the Individual Defendants, had confirmed that it \nwould be possible to convert their subordinated debt in the amount of UAH 5.5 billion \nand that Mr Ko lomoisky would cause the injection of equity capital of UAH 5.6 billion \ninto the Bank by 31 December 2018 and UAH 4.4 billion by 31 December 2019.  This \nletter was written on the same day that both the Management Board and the Supervisory \nBoard approved the Bank’s capitalisation programme and the R estructuring Plan.  The \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n123 \n Supervisory Board did so at a meeting in which both of the Individual Defendants \nparticipated and at which they both voted in favour of approval.  \n492.

{"start": 458500, "text": "y 31 December 2018 and UAH 4.4 billion by 31 December 2019.

In my view, the evidence of the Individual Defendants’ active participation in the \nformulation and presentation of the Bank’s recapitalisation proposals at this stage of \nthe negotiations with the NBU is compelling.  Although the signatory on much of the \ncorrespondence on behalf of the Bank was Mr Dubilet, the Supervisory Board on which \nthey both sat was actively consulted and it is most improbable that he would have said \nwhat he said about the shareholders’ involvement if that had not accurately represented  \ntheir informed position.  Furthermore, Ms Rozhkova referred to a number of meetings \nshe had with Mr Kolomoisky in the early part of 2016 in which she remembered \ninforming him that the Restructuring Plan should not be dependent on his wider \nbusiness interests.  As she put it, she told him that “we simply needed a clear plan that \nproposed realistic ways to provide the additional capital required, so that the Bank could \nactually solve the problem and mee t the applicable regulatory requirements.”  \n493. At the beginning of February 2016, the NBU instructed Kroll.  Ms Rozhkova confirmed \nin cross -examination that it took this course in order , amongst other things , to assist in \na search for the Individual Defendants ’ assets  in the event of  a shortfall in the Bank’s \nfunds.   However Ms Rozhkova was insistent that the focus of this was not on the \npotential for post-nationalisation claim s against the Individual Defendants, the \nformulation of which it had already identified .   In evidence, which rings true and whi ch \nI accept, she said  that the question which mattered if the Bank were to become insolvent \nwas whether the Deposit Guarantee Fund (“DGF”) would find  any evidence that the \nshareholders were responsible.   But the reason for retaining Kroll at this stage (and  Alix \nat what seems to have been a later date ) is illustrated by the following exchange:  \n“Q.  What was going on here, Ms Rozhkova -- let's be  absolutely clear about it -- \nwas at the beginning  of 2016 the NBU was retaining Kroll and AlixPartners  \nbecause the NBU contemplated that in due course a claim  might need to be brought \nin the name of the Bank agains t the shareholders.  Is that true or false?  \nA.  It's not true, my Lord, because we asked Kroll to find  the assets of the former \nshareholders of PrivatBank,  also to understand if they really can fulfil the  \nrecapitalisation plan because Mr Kolomoisky and  Mr Bogolyubov signed the plan \nand promised -- sorry -- to put a lot of additional collateral which should be -- \n\"collateral\", I mean the real estate, the plans, the  aircraft and others -- into the Bank \nto secure the loan , and for us it was very important to understand if they  really have \nit.” \n494. Mr Howard returned to this point with Ms Rozhkova a little later, but she reconfirmed \nthe essence of her evidence in slightly different words.  Having taken her to a biz.nz. ua \narticle from May 2017 , the following exchange took place : \n“Q.  Now, I take it from that that the true position is  that at the beginning of 2016 \nthe NBU was planning for  nationalisation and preparing for that and searching fo r \nassets of the Bank's beneficial owners with a view to  their being sued by the Bank, \nbecause it would have to  be by the Bank, in due course to obtain recompense.

Now, I take it from that that the true position is  that at the beginning of 2016 \nthe NBU was planning for  nationalisation and preparing for that and searching fo r \nassets of the Bank's beneficial owners with a view to  their being sued by the Bank, \nbecause it would have to  be by the Bank, in due course to obtain recompense.  Do \nyou agree?  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n124 \n A.  I cannot agree with it.  My Lord, we hired AlixPartner s to help us to prepare \nfor the potential nationalisation  of the Bank if the negative case will be realised -- \nI mean negative case, if shareholders will not fulfil  their recapitalisation plan which \nwas agreed with NBU . \nQ.  And Kroll were searching for their assets?  \nA.  Yes, Kroll were -- and we asked Kroll to research thei r assets to understand \nhow this plan is really -- let m e say, can be realised by the shareholders, and due to \nthe systemical importance of the Bank, when we received the  plan from the \nshareholders and approved this plan in th e board meeting at the NBU, it was one \nof the conditions  of the memorandum and our partners also want to receive  from \nus some confirmation that this plan is a realistic  one.” \n495. This followed other steps , which the Individual Defendants said that the NBU and the \nUkrainian Government had been taking to instruct professional advisors, including \nHogan Lovells, as early as the middle of July 20 15.  It was said by the Individual \nDefendants that these  steps included the  develop ment of  a strategy to recover losses \nfrom the Individual Defendants  in the event that the Bank’s restructuring failed and the \nBank had to be nationalised .  In particular , it pointed to t hree meetings which Mr \nChris topher Hardman of Hogan Lovells attend ed at the offices of the Presidential \nAdministration in September 2015, November 2015  and February 201 6, parts of which \nwere attended by President Poroshenko , in order to discuss assistance that his firm \nmight provide to the NBU . \n496. I infer from this evidence that the topic of the assets available to the  existing owners \nwas discussed , but the context was  not as specific to the Bank and the Individual \nDefendants  as that for which they now  contend , nor was it focused on claims which had \nalready been formulated let alone prepared .  The evidence from Mr Hardman (which \nwas adduced for the pur poses of an interlocutory application ) is that the discussions at \nthose meetings was high level and general.   Indeed the generality of the discussions is \napparent from the fact that it also appears from the evidence that the issue of who might \nbe any claimant was discussed , because the NBU itself was at this stage a major creditor \nof the Bank in respect of the refinancing loans, the proceeds of which it suspected had \nbeen misapplied.  \n497. The President and his advisors were interested to understand what Hogan Lovells  had \nbeen able to achieve on the Ablyazov and Pugachev cases.   In particular, Mr Hardman  \nwas told that Ukraine had many banks which were in difficulties and in respect of which  \nthere may be a need for asset recover y assistance to be given .  He said:  \n“My impression was of a genuine need to address severe difficulties being \nexperienced in the banking sector and to learn what possibilities may be open to \nseek redress internationally (not just in England). ” \n498. There is no reason to doubt the accuracy of the impression with which Mr Hardman \nwas left as a result of these meeting s.

I think it is clear that the possibility that the Bank \nmight have claims against the  Individual Defendants was in the mind of the Ukrainian \nauthorities when these meetings were being held .

However , I do not consider that th ese meetings  throw very much light on \nhow, if the Bank were to be nationalised , any claims against the Individual Defendants  \nmight be formulated or pursued.  There is no indication that any evidence was being \nconsidered at this stage  or that there was detailed discussion about the fact s; it is clear \nto me that the discussions were much more general than that.  \n499. On 4 February 2016, there was another meeting of the Supervisory Board attended by \nthe Individual Defendants, both of whom were recorded as taking part (and there is no \nreason to conclude that they did not in fact do so).  The existing draft of the Bank’s \nrecovery plan in the form  proposed by the Management Board was approved.  The form \nof the draft which was approved at that meeting was not in the evidence, but on the \nsame day, Mr Kolomoisky wrote to Ms Gontareva undertaking to make the additional \ncontribu tions to the Bank’s capital referred to by Mr Dubilet, each amount to be funded \nfrom his own private resources.  He also assured the NBU that he would cause the \ncapitalisation of the Bank to comply with the applicable capital adequacy ratios in the \namounts and within the terms determined by the NBU.  A few days later, Mr \nKolomoisky wrote again accelerating the dates on which he agreed to effect his own \npersonal injection of further capital by a year in each case.  He also added a commitment \nas a memb er of t he Supervisory Board to assure the NBU that , from 1 March 2016 to \n31 December 2020 , loan repayments would be made from the list of large \nconcentrations (or related party lending) at a rate of at least UAH 1.293 billion per \nmonth.  \n500. The NBU’s response on 10 February 2016 was that these proposals were still \ninadequate, including in relation to the time periods for the reductions of the related \nparty loans and the liquidity ratio to be applied to the assets suggested as collateral.  It \nalso commented that there was no duly executed letter of guarantee from the Bank’s \nshareholder, which must have been  a reference to Mr Bogolyubov, because Mr \nKolomoisky had already signed one.  This was relied on by Mr Bogolyubov as an \nindication that the NBU knew that he was unwilling to sign one.  I do not think that that \nnecessarily follows and in any event this reference does not detract from the fact that \nthe evidence (particularly his participation at Supervisory Board meetings, and what \nMr Dubilet to ld the NBU that the shareholders had agreed) clearly indicates that Mr \nBogolyubov knew exactly what was going on and was actively consulted on the \ndiscussions between the NBU, Mr Kolomoisky and the Bank.  At about this time, Ms \nGontareva spoke to Mr Kolomo isky in the presence of Ms Rozhkova and informed him \nthat, if the Bank provided a satisfactory restructuring plan, it would be afforded a proper \nopportunity to fulfil it, but if it did not do so, the NBU would have to declare the Bank \ninsolvent.  \n501. Two days later, on 12 February 2016, at a meeting in which Mr Bogolyubov and Mr \nKolomoisky participated, the Supervisory Board unanimously approved the proposal \nfor the Bank’s financial recovery programme for the period 2016 to 2019.

The plan \nincluded a r estructuring programme which incorporated a list of actions.  This list \nincluded a proposal for the Bank to take 169 items said to be worth UAH 31.13 billion \nonto its balance sheet by 1 April 2016 (including property to be given to the NBU as \ncollateral fo r the NBU’s own refinancing loans) and to submit a schedule for the sale \nof such assets over a two -year period.  It also approved a proposal for the Bank to take \nsubstitute collateral in the form of mortgages of what were described as “275 objects”.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n126 \n The plan stipulated that the relevant mortgage agreements “would contain terms on the \nBank’s right to satisfy the creditor’s claims through the quick and unconditional \nobtaining of title to such property - by means of pre -trial settlement”.  \n502. The assets to be transferred were listed in an annex (Annex A) to the Restructuring Plan \nitemised by reference to 32 identified borrowers (including ten Borrowers and four \nIntermediary Borrowers) whose indebtedness to the Bank, totalling in aggregate UAH \n30.75 billion, was to be reduced or discharged by the transfer of an identified asset.  The \nmajority of the assets, valued at a total figure of UAH 31.12 billion, were descr ibed as \n“oil base”, but they also included miscellaneous items of real property amon gst which \nwere the FC Dnipro training base, situated at Mykhailo Didevych (Pionersky) Lane 14 \nand 12, Dnipro (the “Training Centre”) listed against Karinda LLC, the Metalurg \nStadium situated at 7 Khersonskaya Street, Dnipro (the “Stadium”) and a number of \nhotels and office buildings including Hotel Mir situated at 40 Richchia Zhovtnia \nAvenue, Kyiv (“Hotel Mir”) and Hotel Zirka Bukoveluya in Palyanytsia, Ivano \nFrankivsk Oblast (“Hotel Zirka”).  Each asset was given a value, with a representation \nthat an upda ted valuation of the oil bases had been requested from Baker Tilly  Ukraine \nEC LLC ( “Baker Tilly” or “BT”) , to be submitted to the NBU by 19 February 2016.  \n503. The assets to be mortgaged were listed in another annex (Annex B) to the Restructuring \nPlan.  They included numerous gas stations and a number of other assets including \naircraft, a Radisson Blu managed hotel in Croatia called Hotel Split and GM Georgian \nManganese Holdings, valued in aggregate at UAH 76.69 billion.  The mortgages were \nto be granted by 1 September 2016 in support of loans totalling UAH 76.24 billi on to \ncorporate clients with high concentration of debt, including 27 of the Borrowers.  The \nNBU stipulated that this was to be done over a four month period at a rate of 25% per \nmonth.  \n504. On 23 February 2016, the NBU resolved to agree to the Restructuring Plan.  The \nresolution No- 103/БТ stipulated that assets to the value of UAH 31.13 billion (as set \nout in Annex A) were to be transferred to the Bank’s balance sheet by 1 April 2016, \nsubject to verification of fair value by the NBU.  This deadline derived from an NBU \nresolution applicable to all Ukrainian regulated banks requiring them to achieve what \nMs Rozhkova called a positive value of capital by that date, itself extending a deadline \noriginally required by the IMF.  The resolution also required assets to the value of UAH \n76.69 billion (as set out in Annex B) to be mortgaged by way of additional collateral \nby 1 September 2016,  also subject to verification of fair value by the NBU.

This too \nreflected a deadline applicable to all banks.  It was Ms Rozhkova’s evidence that the \nextension of these deadlines for all Ukrainian banks was influenced by the lack of \nprogress made by the Bank in improving its capital position, a decision which reflec ted \nthe importance of the Bank to the Ukrainian financial system more generally.  \n505. The NBU resolution also recorded that, in the event that the acts for which the \nRestructuring Plan provided were insufficient to increase the Bank’s capital by the \nrequired amount, the Bank’s shareholders (i.e. the Individual Defendants) would be \nobliged to provide additional collateral within one month of the failure to comply with \nthe terms of the  Restructuring Plan.  The resolution also included a number of other \nrestrictions on the types of transaction the Bank could enter into until the Restructuring \nPlan had been complied with, including prohibitions on transactions with related parties \nand the granting of loans to borrowers with non -transparent ownership structures and \nclients whose financial position did not prove their capacity to service loans on m arket \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n127 \n terms and conditions.  Ms Rozhkova, as acting deputy head of the NBU, together with \nthe acting director of the NBU’s banking supervision department ( G A Gritsenko) and \nthe head of the NBU’s department of monitoring of parties related to banks (Mr \nZavadetskyi) were charged with controlling the performance of the resolution.  \n506. The authority to give effect to the recognition of the Asset Transfers on the Bank’s \nbalance sheet was given at a meeting of the Supervisory Board held on 28 March 2016, \nin which both of the Individual Defendants participated.  The minutes of the meeting \nrecorded that those attending reviewed information from Mr Dubilet before giving the \nBoard’s approval.  The resolution was “to recognise property on the Bank’s balance \nsheet towards the repayment of the borrowers’ debts to the Bank under the loans issued \naccording to the list contained in Appendix No 1”.  Appendix 1 was similar but not \nidentical to the list which had been included at Annex A to the Restructuring Plan.  \n507. The evidence clearly establishes that Mr Kolomoisky led the discussions with the NBU \nwhich led to the submission of the Restructuring Plan, at the heart of which were the \nAsset Transfers.  It is therefore surprising to say the least that, in his Defence, he \ndeclined to admit that he had any responsibility for decisions made by the Bank to \naccept assets in return for the repayment of Relevant Loans or as to the valuation of \nsuch assets.  The only exception to this non -admission was his admission tha t he was \none of the five members of the Supervisory Board who gave their approval to the \nacceptance of assets onto the Bank’s balance sheet at the 28 March meeting.  \n508. I am also satisfied that Mr Bogolyubov was well aware of what was proposed, and \nparticipated in the Supervisory Board’s determination of the way forward.  Ms \nRozhkova said that it was made clear to her by Mr Kolomoisky on a number of \noccasions that he woul d need to check with Mr Bogolyubov before he agreed to points \nof detail in relation to the implementation, and there is no reason to think that he did \nnot do so.

He also participated at \nmeetings of the Supervisory Board at which successive versions of the Restructuring \nPlan were discussed and approved for submission.  Although there is no record of any \nagreement by him to make a personal contribution to the recapitalisation in the manner \nagreed by Mr Kolomoisky, it is clear to me that he must have both known about and \napproved the proposal to convert his shareholder subordinated debt as referred to in Mr \nDubilet’s January 201 6 letter.  \n509. There was also other miscellaneous correspondence which demonstrates that Mr \nBogolyubov was keeping a close interest in those of his assets (often held by him \nthrough trustees including in particular Sim Lim) which were put forward as part of the \nAsset Tra nsfers.  The Bank drew particular attention to an advisory e -mail from \nEvgeniy Ruvinskiy on 6 July 2016 dealing with what was described as the transfer of \nbuildings, by which he meant the direct sale of properties to the Bank at the price \nspecified in the mortgage agreements.  Mr Ruvinskiy advised Mr Bogolyubov that, as \nthe balance sheet values of six of his assets (including Hotel Mir) were significantly \nless than the values which were to be attributed to them in the mortgage agreements, \nsubstantial advers e tax consequences would arise.   The potential exposure was in excess \nof UAH 386 million, a failure to pay which would result in criminal penalties for the \nrelevant company’s directors and chief accountant.  The discrepancies were striking: \nthe aggregate b alance sheet value currently attributed to these properties was UAH 77.8 \nmillion while the aggregate value attributed to the same assets under the mortgage \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n128 \n agreements was UAH 1,056 million, a more than thirteenfold increase.  One of those \nassets was Hotel Mir, in respect of which the book value (only UAH 14 million) was \nvery substantially less than the amounts which the experts now agree it was worth \n(between  UAH 250 million and UAH 260 million), but for present purposes the point \nof significance was that Mr Bogolyubov was on very clear notice that the proposed \ncredit value of UAH 449 million for Hotel Mir was far in excess of the value so far \nrecognised.  \n510. Ms Rozhkova said that the NBU was aware that implementation of the Restructuring \nPlan would be a difficult process but she said that it was not unrealistic.  She said that \nit was required to ensure that the Bank conformed with its obligation to increase its \ncapital by 1 April 2016 (a deadline that had already been extended).  There is s ome \nevidence that the Bank tried to push back against what the NBU insisted it should \nprovide by way of new capital, but there is no evidence that the NBU was being \nunreasona ble in the requirement that it sought to impose.  Indeed, quite the contrary, \nthe evidence is more consistent with the NBU struggling to make the Bank and the \nIndividual Defendants take the relevant legal and regulatory requirements sufficiently \nseriously and face up to the scale of the Bank’s capital problems.  \n511. Furthermore, as Ms Rozhkova also explained, in the events that occurred, the NBU \npermitted the Bank an additional five months to complete the Asset Transfers without \ntaking the enforcement steps that Ms Gontareva had already explained the NBU would \nhave to  take if the Restructuring Plan was not complied with.

The position as of 1 April \n2016 was that , of the UAH 31.13 billion required by the NBU’s February resolution to \nhave been transferred onto the Bank’s balance sheet, only assets to the value of UAH \n5.628 billion had in fact been transferred.  The evidence also demonstrated that the \nBank’s proposals for supplying additional collateral of UAH 76.69 billion in the four \nmonth period prior to 1 September 2016 did not then comply with the terms of the \nRestructuring Plan, a situation which remained unchanged as at 25 May 2016.  \n512. On 1 July 20 16, the Bank Audit Department of the NBU completed an audit report on \nthe Bank’s loan portfolio quality and loan risk.  It was heavily critical of the Bank’s \nlending and  reached a number of conclusions , including that:  \n“The Bank’s management purposefully makes management decisions aimed at \nservicing a group of companies that are related to the Bank and/or are within the \nscope of the interests of the Bank’s beneficial owners ” \nand after making a number of other serious criticisms of the Bank’s management and \nthe quality of its loan portfolio concluded : \n“Therefore, the Bank is an instrument for raising funds for lending to a wide range  \nof parties related to the Bank. Most of the corporate loan portfolio is scheme -based \nand sham . \nThe management’s actions are aimed at [fictitious] maintaining the quality of assets \nand avoiding the formation of reserves in the required amounts with a wide range \nof instruments”  \nThis report als o commented that the accepted collateral quality was of particular \nconcern  and drew attention to what it called the “increase loan risk ” where borrowers \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n129 \n had been made advances to fund prepayments for the delivery of goods by amongst \nother s the English Defendants, where the property rights in those goods had been \nassigned to the Bank by way of collateral.  \n513. On or shortly before 1 July 2016, the Individual Defendants both signed a shareholder \nrepresentation letter addressed to PwC in connection with their audit of the Bank’s \nfinancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.  They both confirmed their \n12 month commitment to provide the Bank and its subsidiaries with operational and \nfinancial support sufficient to enable it to co ntinue in operation for at least twelve \nmonths from the date of the letter.  They acknowledged that Mr Kolomoisky had \nprovided his personal guarantee as collateral for the refinancing loans provided by the \nNBU during the course of 2014 and 2015.  The lette r also contained the following \nrepresentation:  \n“We confirm that we understand the terms of repayment of loans through the \nrepossession of property in collateral amounting to UAH 31,845 million on the \nBank’s balance sheet, as specified in Appendix C, in course of implementation of \nthe Restructuring Plan  on refinancing loans, approved by the Resolution of the \nNational Bank of Ukraine No - 103/БТ dated 23 February 2016. We also understand \nthat the respective transactions may lead to obtaining control or significant \ninfluence by us over the companies which w ere under our control  or significant \ninfluence in the past, and this issue requires additional analysis after finalization of \nall legal and operational aspects of these transactions.”  \n514.

At the beginning of July 2016 , the Bank was representing to the NBU that it had taken \nassets to the value of UAH 31.7 billion onto its balance sheet, comprising 149 petroleum \nbases.  However it appears from the correspondence (in particular a letter of 2 July \n2016) and such records as t here are of meetings that Mr Kolomoisky had with Ms \nRozhkova and Ms Gontareva that the NBU was not prepared to accept the attributed \nvalues because their work indicated that many of them were overvalued.  In part this \nwas bec ause the valuation reports had been prepared for internal use only and were not \ncapable of being relied on by the NBU.  It was also because the NBU’s own risk \nmanagement department had conducted an onsite inspection of relevant oil storage \nfacilities (“OSF s”) many of which were found to have been out of service for many \nyears.  It appeared to Ms Rozhkova that the Bank’s valuers (Baker Tilly) had not been \ninstructed to carry out the more in -depth exercise, including site visits, that would have \nbeen necessar y to expose the true value of the assets.  \n515. Shortly after the NBU had made clear to the Bank that it was not satisfied with the \nvalues which had been attributed to the assets which had been transferred, Ms \nRozhkova had a meeting with Mr Kolomoisky at which it appeared that, although the \nBank had made entries in its books to account for assets with a credit value of UAH \n31.4 billion, the NBU assessed the value of those assets at just UAH 9.7 billion.   Mr \nKolomoisky told her that he had thought that the NBU would simply perform formal \nchecks and that,  so long as assets were transferred to the Bank and paperwork was \nprovided, that would be sufficient.   She informed him that the NBU was serious about \nthe real need for the Bank to restore its capital position to acceptable levels and that she \ndid not believe that the overvaluation was accidental.  She also explained in her witness \nstatement that the positi on was a serious problem for the NBU, because receipt of \nfurther funding from the IMF was contingent on all banks making sufficient progress \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n130 \n in recapitalising.  The NBU considered that the Bank’s failure to provide assets of \nsufficient value put this funding at risk.  \n516. It was only after a meeting with the then President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, which \nwas attended by Mr Kolomoisky, Ms Gontareva and Ms Rozhkova , that the situation \nchanged.  At that meeting, Ms Rozhkova explained to the President and Mr Kolomoisky \nthat a substantial portion of the assets that were taken onto the Bank’s balance sheet as \npart of the process of implementing the Restructuring Plan did not have sufficient value.  \nThis meant that the NBU could not verify to the IMF that the recapitalisation o f banks \nhad reached the level necessary for them to release further funding to Ukraine.  Mr \nKolomoisky said that the NBU was being unreasonable, but the evidence is that the \nPresident’s response was to ask Mr Kolomoisky to reconsider his position.  \n517. It seems that this response led to a letter headed Personal Guarantee Undertaking from \nMr Kolomoisky to the NBU dated 10 July 2016.  In this letter, Mr Kolomoisky \nacknowledged that the Bank still had to take the measures provided for by the \nRestructuring Plan.  Mr Kolomoisky recognised that, amongst other breaches relating \nto matters such as the failure to produce a schedule for realisation of the fixed assets up \nto the end of December 2018, the value of the assets accepted by the Bank onto its \nbalance shee t for repayment of the loans"}

In \nother words the value of the assets so far transferred was only UAH 9.7 billion.  He \ntherefore gave a personal guarantee that from October 2016 repayment of indebtedness \nowed by borrowers connected to the Bank would begin and, by the end of August 2016, \nthe Bank would receive onto its balance sheet enough of the assets mentioned in an \nattachment at the m arket price previously agreed with the NBU to liquidate the shortfall \nin capital.  The attachment listed assets stated to have a total value of UAH 76.66 \nbillion.  \n518. In the same letter, Mr Kolomoisky confirmed that the Bank would complete the \nincrease in the quality of its credit portfolio by concluding the pledge of assets to the \nsum of UAH 76.7 billion.  He also said that by the end of August it would submit to the \nNBU for ratification a coherent plan for the quarterly sale of assets received onto its \nbalance sheet in repayment of loans to a sum of UAH 31 billion.  The assets listed in \nthe attachment to Mr Kolomoisky’s 10 July letter comprised real estate, aircraft an d \nindustrial assets stated to have a total value of UAH 75.1 billion and 251 petrol stations \nstated to have a total value of UAH 1.5 billion .  They included genuinely valuable \nassets , including, for example, Neftekhimik Prikarpatye Oil  Refinery, Borivazh and \nGM Georgian Manganese Holding , although in the event none of  these  more  valuable \nassets w ere transferred to the Bank .  They also included assets in which Mr Bogolyubov \nhad interests (Goiania, Pennylane, Dniproazot and Borivazh ) and at least one, Hotel \nSplit, of which he was the  sole (95%) owner .  The Bank submitted, and I agree, that it \nis plain that Mr Kolomoisky must have been acting with Mr Bogolyubov’s authority \nand approval in sending this list to the NBU.  \n519. At about this time or possibl y a little earlier  (4 July 2016) , the NBU engaged Alix, \nwhich itself retained Asters to advise on Ukrainian law.  Ms Rozhkova described  the \npurpose of the engagement , as being part of the NBU’s preparation for “the negative \nscenario which finally was realised”, by which she meant nationalisation  or liquidation  \nof the Bank .  At that stage the NBU was preparing for the possibilities of both options  \nin the event that the Bank was no t recapitalised in accordance with the NBU’s \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n131 \n requirements .  I accept this evidence, which is consistent with the reasons for (and the \napproach taken to) engaging Kroll earlier in the year.  \n520. On 27 July 2016 , the NBU sent the Bank its audit  report  for the period 1 May 2014 to \n1 January 2016 , together with a  seven -page covering letter .  The recipients were Mr \nStelma kh (by then the chair man of the Supervisory Board ) and Mr Dubilet.  There is \nno direct evidence that it was sent to Mr Bogolyubov as he was no longer chair man of \nthe Supervisory Board  or Mr Kolomoisky , but given its nature and importance, I am \nsatisfied that it is likely that it  came to the attention of both of them.   The covering letter \nreferred to the impact of active transactions with related parties on the Bank’s capital \nas being critical, given their volume (807.38% of regulatory capital  and 70.22% of total \nassets) and the consequential high level of risk.

It also criticised “the practice of … \nissuing large amounts of loans to  borrowers with low solvency , i.e. companies with \nunpro fitable and/or essentially non -existent operations” and the “artificial risk \nminimisation from lending by a low -liquid pledge in the form of property rights  to \ngoods in doubtful contracts, the concentration of which in the collateral structure is … \n57.19% ”.  The letter also made specific reference to the “concealment by the Bank of \ntransactions with related parties”  which amounted to a clear finding  that the serious \nproblems identified in the NBU’s 2014 audit report had not been resolved by the Bank’s \nmanag ement , but rather  the same malpractice had continued.  \n521. Furthermore, the letter contained an instruction to the Bank to “apply adequate \ndisciplinary measures to persons who have committed deficiencies and violations in the \nBank’s operations and notify the Department of Banking Supervision and the \nDepartment of Bank Audits of the enfor cement ”.  It also gave notice that  the Bank’ s \noverall CAMELS rating was reduced yet further from the 2014 report and was set by \nthe NBU at the lowest level possible (level 5).  \n522. Despite these very serious criticisms, and the instruction given to apply appropriate \ndisciplinary measures, the only thing the Supervisory Board did after receiving the \nreport was to tell the Management Board “to develop and implement effective measures \nas regards the elimination of the identified violations and the recommendations of the \n[NBU]” .  As the Bank put it “nobody was read the riot act, disciplined, sacked  or sued ”, \nwhich is what might have been expected if these criticism s came as any form of surprise \nto the members of the Supervisory Board  (which still in cluded both Mr Kolomoisky \nand Mr Bogolyubov) . \n523. Likewise , at the next General Meeting held on 26 August 2016 , the shareholders (i.e., \nthe Individual Defendants and  the minority shareholders)  took a similar line with the \nminutes recording praise for the Bank’s achievement s during the course of the year and \nno identifiable concerns about the criticisms made in NBU’s report.  The meeting then \nresol ved that “The 2015 performance of the … Management Board be recognised as \nsatisfactory and  in line with the purpose and directions of the Company’s activities ….”  \nand that “Due to the coordinated actions of the Supervisory Board and the Management \nBoard, the Bank fulfils its obligations to depositors, the budget, shareholders, \ngovernment and regulatory authorities .”  The Minutes also recorded that “ The entire \nteam of the Bank, according to the Supervisory Board, deserves high appraisal and the \nBank’s Management Board financial and operating performance report deserves \napproval ”. \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n132 \n 524.

This conduct is consistent with the  Bank’s  response to the Glavcom \nand NashiGroshi  Articles in which the concern related more to the leakage of \nconfidential information than it did to getting to the bottom of what had occurred or \ndisciplining employees for misconduct.  I agree with the Bank that the most likely  \nexplanation for th e reaction of the Supervisory Board and the General Meeting  is that \nthe conduct of management which  was criticised by the NBU  amounted to and resulted \nfrom compliance with the Individual Defendants ’ own instructions.  \n525. Throughout the period in which the assets to be transferred were being identified, Mr \nKolomoisky was intimately involved in the process.  He communicated with Ms \nRozhkova on a regular basis (she thought approximately every two weeks) and \nexplicitly recogni sed that, where particular assets were not acceptable security, \nalternatives could be found.  The documentary evidence in support of Mr Bogolyubov’s \ninvolvement was less clearcut and there is little doubt that he did not participate directly \nin the discuss ions with the NBU to the same extent as Mr Kolomoisky.  Ms Rozhkova \nsaid that she assumed that this was because, unlike Mr Kolomoisky, Mr Bogolyubov \nwas not based in Ukraine at the time.  However, she said that s he was informed by Mr \nKolomoisky on a number of occasions that he needed to check with Mr Bogolyubov \nbefore agreeing to particular recapitalisation measures . \n526. There was no indication from the evidence that Mr Kolomoisky did not do what he told \nMs Rozhkova he intended to do and Mr Bogolyubov called no evidence to contradict \nwhat Ms Rozhkova said in her witness statement to this effect.  I am satisfied that what \nshe says she was told by Mr Kolomoisky about the need for him to consult Mr \nBogolyubov about what was proposed is an acc urate reflection of what was said.  I also \nfind on the balance of probabilities, that the relationship between Mr Kolomoisky and \nMr Bogol yubov at this stage was such that consultation with him was both necessary \nand in fact occurred.  I find that he both knew and agreed to the substance of what was \nproposed by Mr Kolomoisky in his discussion with Ms Rozhkova.  I also find that he, \nlike Mr K olomoisky, can have been in no doubt from the meetings which Mr \nKolomoisky had with Ms Rozhkova, Ms Gontareva and President Poroshenko in and \nabout July 2016 that the NBU’s requirements for the recapitalisation of the Bank were \nserious and needed to be imp lemented effectively and in full.  \n527. Meanwhile, on 28 and 29 July 2016, the  Pechersky District Court granted injunction s \non the application of the GPO freezing  the Cyprus branch accounts of Trade  Point A gro \nand the BVI Defendants  as part  of a criminal investigation into the Unreturned \nPayments .  These orders were made as a result of the i nvestigation that had been started \nas result of publication of the Glavcom Article.  They were then revoked during the \ncourse of September 2016 on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence that Trade \nPoint Ag ro and the BVI Defendants , or their officials , were involved in the commission \nof the specified criminal proceedings under which the attachment was imposed .

By the early part of September 2016, the Bank had recorded assets of UAH 30 billion \nand US$163 million as transferred in accordance with the Restructuring Plan.  It had \nalso applied those amounts in reduction of outstanding balances on Relevant Loans, \nIntermediary Loans and other outstanding loan indebtedness.  The technical means by \nwhich this was done was that 40 companies entered into mortgage agreements ( the \n“Mortgages”) with the Bank for the pledge of some 387 different assets as collateral for \namongst  other obligations, the outstanding indebtedness under the Relevant Loans and \nthe Intermediary Loans.  Each of the Mortgages recorded a value for the assets pledged \nto the Bank, said to be based on contemporaneous valuation reports.  \n529. Shortly after execution of each of the Mortgages, the Bank’s books recorded that the \nassets pledged under them had been transferred to the Bank.  At or about the same time, \nthe value recorded in the valuation reports was then set against the outstanding ba lance \non the Relevant Loans, the Intermediary Loans and the other indebtedness in respect of \nwhich the Mortgages had been granted.  The Bank’s books recorded that the credit \nvalues of the Transferred Assets were set against each Relevant Loan, Intermediary  \nLoan or other indebtedness and were all denominated in UAH apart from the credit \nvalues applicable to the aircraft which were denominated in US $.  In some instances a \nsingle asset was used to reduce the balance of a single loan in the Bank’s books.  In \nother instances a single asset was used to reduce the balance on a number of loans.  336 \nof the total number of assets pledged pursuant to the Mortgages were recorded in the \nBank’s books as being used to repay all or pa rt of a Relevant Loan or an Intermediar y \nLoan.  Of the 336 assets, seven were items of real estate, nine were aircraft, 246 were \npetrol stations and 74 were OSFs.  \n530. I have already described the background to the Restructuring Plan and how it led to the \nAsset Transfers .  I have also summarised why the process of tran sferring assets onto \nthe Bank’s balance sheet was regarded by the NBU as an essential part of recapitalising \nit and the apparent reluctance of the Individual  Defendants to ensure that this was \nachieved . \n531. Amongst the 336 Transferred Assets were two hotels, Hotel Zirka  and Hotel Mir.  The \nBank’s pleaded case is that its ownership and control of Hotel Zirka is subject to \nchallenge in the Ukrainian courts and that it has lost title to Hotel Mir following \nproceedings brought in Ukraine by Artis LLC, the transferor of which was admitted by \nMr Kolomoisky to have been ultimately owned by him and Mr Bogolyubov at the time \nof the transfer.  I shall revert to those assets when explaining my findings on value, but \nby the conclusion of the trial the Bank no longer advanced this argument in relation to \nHotel Zirka.  \n532. The credit values recorded in the Bank’s books at the time of the Asset Transfers were \nbased on a number of third party valuations.  Those amounts were then recognised in \nthe Bank’s 2016 financial statements, and are called by the Bank and its expert value r \nthe “Original 2016 Values” and by Mr Kolomoisky and his expert valuer the “Original \n2016 Fair Values”.

In the event, the Original 2016 Values were \nrestated in the Bank’s balance sheet as at 31 December 2016 in its 2018 financial \nstatements (i.e. post -nationalisation).  Those restated values are called by the Ba nk and \nits expert valuer the “Restated 2016 Values” and by Mr Kolomoisky and his expert \nvaluer the “Restated 2016 Fair Values”.  In reaching the Restated 2016 Values, the \nBank used the services of a number of valuers, including in particular Asset Expertis e \nLLC (“Asset Expertise”), Expert+ LLC (“Expert+) and Volyn -Expert LLC (“Volyn”).  \nThe reports they produced will feature from time to time in my findings as to the value \nof the Transferred A ssets.  \n533. I shall also refer from time to time to a report which was produced by EY in accordance \nwith instructions given by the Bank and NBU.  This report came about because, on 5 \nOctober 2016, the NBU passed resolution 323 -rsh/BT, which amongst other things \nrequir ed the Bank to ensure the involvement of an internationally recognised audit \ncompany to update the 2015 stress tests and to verify the adequacy and quality of the \nmeasures taken by the Bank to comply with the NBU’s resolution No - 103/БТ dated 23 \nFebruary 2 016 (as to which see paragraph s 504 and 512 above).  Amongst other things, \nthis had required the fair value of the assets to be transferred to the Bank to be subject \nto verification by the NBU.  \n534. The product of this part of resolution 323 -rsh/BT was EY’s Bank Business Audit Status \nReport dated 22 November  2016 (the “EY November 2016 Report”) , a reading of which \nmakes clear why the Bank’s 2016 financial statements were so heavily qualified.  \nAmongst other matters it included a desktop review of the fair value of the Transferred \nAssets “which were subsequently verified by the NBU”.  \n535. It is also clear from NBU resolution 323 -rsh/BT that as at 5 October 2016 the NBU was \nnot then satisfied that there had been proper compliance by the Bank with resolution \nNo- 103/БТ and that was one of the reasons why EY were appointed to carry out the \nexercise which culminated in the EY November 2016 Report.  I do not think that \nanybody who had seen  NBU resolution 323 -rsh/BT could have been in any doubt that \npart of EY’s task was to verify the Bank’s capital position, which inevitabl y involved \ndoing what i t could to comment on and verify the value of the Transferred Assets.   In \nthe event EY carried out a number of desktop valuations of the Transferred Assets as \npart of the process of preparing the EY November 2016 Report.  Ms Rozhkova agreed \nin cross -examination that so far as she was concerned the NBU was rigorous in t he way \nit checked the value of the assets and properly verified them, but the evidence does not \nsupport a conclusion that what are described as “NBU verified values ” were in fact  \naccepted by the NBU as correct for capital adequacy purposes.  \n \nThe Transformation  \n536. Towards the end of September 2016, it was becoming clear that the Bank was unable \nto comply with the terms of the R estructuring Plan.  Failure meant that it would be in \nbreach  of the r equirement s of Law 78 and Resolution 260 to achieve a capital adequacy \nratio of 5% or more by 1 October 20 16.  This led to Mr Kolomoisky suggesting to Ms \nRozhkova that the"}

Failure meant that it would be in \nbreach  of the r equirement s of Law 78 and Resolution 260 to achieve a capital adequacy \nratio of 5% or more by 1 October 20 16.  This led to Mr Kolomoisky suggesting to Ms \nRozhkova that the NBU should consider a solvent nationalisation of the Bank, for \nwhich there was an earlier precedent arising out of the 2008 financial crisis.  By this he \nmeant that there could be an injection of additional state support while the existing \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n135 \n shareholders would retain part of their shareholding.  Ms Rozhkova’ s response was that \nthis would only be a possibility if the Bank’s capital position was positive but \ninsufficient to meet the regulatory requirements. She said that the IMF’s requirements \nmade clear that, if the Bank remained insolvent, an insolvent nationa lisation would be \nthe only option.  \n537. However, an alternative approach, recorde d in a memorandum agreed between the IMF \nand the Government of Ukraine  as an acceptable solution for the Ukrainian banking \nsector , was for the Bank to transfer problematic loans to operational companies with \nboth sufficient cash flow to service their debts and the ability to provide proper \ncollateral for the loans.  Ms Rozhkova discussed this possibility with Mr Kolomoisky \nduring th e course of their meetings in September and early October 2016  and Mr \nKolomoisky indic ated in general terms a willingness to pursue this option and \nmentioned a number of his companies as potentially suitable for this purpose.   He was \ntold by Ms Rozhkova that he and his team needed to submit plans and documents to a \nspecialist team at the NBU for evaluation.  She suggested that the NBU would then be \nable to carry out a preliminary assessment of the financial standing of the compa nies \nand the value and validity of the proposed collateral.   She said that if everything was \nsatisfactory, the NBU would then be able to approve the plan in principle before the \nBank began to implement it.  \n538. At some stage, the date of which is not entirely clear  but was almost certainly on or \nshortly before  5 October 20 16, Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov signed a letter \naddressed to the NBU “regarding the status of complying with obligations for the bank \ncapitalization”.   The proposal made by the Individual Defendants was expressed in \ngeneral terms and was drafted with the assistance of Ms Rozhkova herself.   This \nacknowledged that the Individual Defendants had not been able to comply with their \nobligations und er the Restructuring Plan and (in reflection of their ability to control \nevery aspect of the Bank’s affairs ) offered to provide the NBU with full and open access \nto the Bank’s premises and all its transactions and information systems, in return for \nthe Government agreeing to implement what they called a state -supported capitali sation \nof the Bank, i.e., what was contemplated by Law 78 as  a solvent nationalisation.  \n539. In this letter, the Individual Defendants  also admitted that repayment of loans provided \nto large corporate entities were crucial for the Bank’s future viability and would \nminimiz e “the budget costs for the state ”, and therefore agreed to  take all possible steps \nto ensure their repayment.   They then gave the following guarantee:  \n“Considering the above the ultimate owners of the bank herewith guarantee the \nfollowing:  \n1) Compliance with all conditions provided for by the Law 78 including conversion \nof all liabilities of all related parties to capital and ensuring that the bank’s capital \nvalue is positive.  \n2) Restructuring of corporate credit portfolio base"}

What occurred at this stage demonstrated that both of the Individual Defendants were \ncontinuing to participate in discussions with the NBU, a joint approach which continued \nright up until the Bank’s nationalisation.  As in the period prior to discussions about  the \nTransformation, it remained the case that Mr Kolomoisky was the NBU’s principal \npoint of contact with the Bank’s shareholders, but Ms Rozhkova said that Mr \nKolomoisky always made clear  that Mr Bogolyubov would need to be consulted before \nany furth er recapitalisation measures could be agreed.  Apart from the Deeds of Waiver \nand Indemnity,  which  I address later , there was no evidence that this did not reflect the \ntrue position.  \n541. Ms Rozhkova described the proposal to restructure the corporate credit portfolio by \ntransferring existing loans to operating companies as broadly reflecting the provisions \nin the latest memorandum between the IMF and the Government of Ukraine (as to \nwhich see above) , which allowed for consolidation of cash flows with “creditworthy \naffiliated companies”.   As she also explained, t he IMF imposed strict conditions for \nsuch measures including reliable and comprehensive legal documentation, a viability \ntest to en sure that credible financial plans were provided for any proposed consolidation \nof cash flows  and proper valuations of assets received as loan repayments or new loan \ncollateral (to be conducted by an international appraiser by no later than the end of \nSeptember 2016), all to be accompanied by verification from the NBU.  \n542. In her evidence, Ms Rozhkova  emphasised the importance to the NBU of the need for \nthe Bank to transform its credit portfolio in the manner envisaged by the IMF and the \nGovernment.   I accept this evidence , which was confirm ed by the form of the NBU’s \nresolution dated 5 October 2016 (see also paragraph 533 above) , which itself required \nthe Bank to submit to the NBU within five working days (i.e., by 12 October 201 6) \nwhat was called:  \n“a Corporate Loan Portfolio Restructuring (Transformation) Plan under the market \nconditions by transferring the existing loans to the operating companies that have \nreal and transparent sources of income, determining the clear time period for \nrepayment of t hese loans and execution of additional collateral to ensure the \nachievement of a positive value of the Bank’s capital, subject to the requirements \nof the Resolutions No. 260, No. 103/BT and No. 351 and ensuring its future \nviability;”  \n543. As I have already explained, t he NBU’s 5 October 2016 resolution also require d the \nBank to appoint  an internationally recognised audit company .  This obligation reflected \none of the conditions set out in the IMF’s memorandum and was accepted by the Bank  \non 13 October 2016, when it appointed EY to conduct the audit .

The  results of that \naudit were recorded in  the EY November 2016 Report.    \n544. Ms Rozhkova described t he purpose of  the NBU’s 5 October 2016 resolution as being \nto provide one last chance for the Bank to achieve the required  level of capitalisation \nand to continue to operate under the ownership of the Individual Defendants .  She said \nthat this  was th e option that she  and the rest of the team at the NBU, preferred .  She \nsaid that she had already made clear to Mr Kolomoisky that the detail of the proposals \nwas a matter for the Bank t o propose to the NBU.   However, i n order to ensure that th e \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n137 \n Bank’s proposals were realistic and to provide reassurance to the Bank that the NBU \nwould accept the outcome of this process, she suggested that the Bank propose a list of \nnew borrowers and new loan collateral, and that the NBU could then do a preliminary \nassessment of the financial standing of these companies and the value and validity of \nthe collateral.   Ms Rozhkova though t that this  would avoid the Bank spending a great \ndeal of time putting in place replacement borrowers and security, only to find that t hey \nwere not acceptable to the NBU.  \n545. In the event, this was not what the Bank did.  It  made no concrete proposals for the new \ncompanies or other aspects of what the NBU had called a Corporate Loan Portfolio \nRestructuring (Transformation) Plan within the required five working days .  In \nconsequence t he NBU resolved on 17 October 2016 to appoint Mr Shekmar  to perform \nan unscheduled inspection of the Bank.  \n546. Amongst other matters, t he inspection was designed to cover the extent of the Bank’s \ncompliance both with the 23 February 2016 resolution which had approved the \nRestructuring Plan and  with the 5 October 2016 resolution which had required the Bank \nto produce a transformation plan for the transfer of existing loans to operating \ncompanies with  “real and transparent sources of income ”.  The inspection was also \nrequired to consider the Bank’s compliance with restrictions in relation to related party \nlending, and lending to customers with non transparent ownership structures whose \nfinancial standing did not support their ability to repay their loans .  In his evidence, Mr \nShekmar also explained  that the inspection was intended to cover the progress made by \nthe Bank in implementing the recommendations of the NBU’s 2016 audit report  (see \nparagraph 520 above) , including in particular the extent to which the Bank had \nincreased its provision for loans and procure d higher quality collateral when issuing \nnew loans . \n547. It is of relevance that , around this time , Ms Rozhkova refused to continue with her face \nto face meetings with Mr Kolomoisk y.  They  came to an end when, at one of them, he \nbecame aggressive and made the  “hungry tiger in a cage”  threat I referred to earlier in \nthis judgment.  This meeting had been  called by Ms Gontareva and was also attended \nby two other deputy governors of the NBU.  It is worth setting out in full what occurred \non that occasion, because Ms Rozhkova’s evidence was not challenged and it gives a \ngood flavour of the sort of behaviour of which Mr Ko lomoisky was capable , and the \nfact that he seems to have regarded himself as above the law.  It is entirely consistent \nwith other evidence as to his domineering character and the extent to which he was \naccustomed to getting his own way:  \n“Ms Gontareva had called the meeting because we had seen little or no progress \nfrom the Bank on the intended restructuring of its "}

Ms Gontareva began the meeting by saying that we could \nnot see that any p rogress had been made. I had the impression from the outset of \nthis meeting that Mr Kolomoisky was in a very aggressive mood, although it wasn’t \nexactly clear what had happened to provoke this. He said to Ms Gontareva that, if \nthe NBU did nationalise the B ank, he would simply relocate to Israel. But he was \nat pains to make clear he would be able to reach us even from Israel, saying that “I \nhave very long arms”. After Ms Gontareva left the meeting to attend to other \nmatters, Mr Kolomoisky looked at me, touch ing his stomach, and said that he was \na “a hungry tiger in a cage, but the door is open – so you can leave” and repeated \nwhat he had said earlier about having long arms, but going further this time and \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n138 \n saying that he would be able to find me anywhere. I had (and continue to have) no \ndoubt that this was a physical threat he was making against me.”  \n548. In the event, on 20 October 2016 , Mr Yatsenko sent to the NBU  what he called \n“information on transformation of the petroleum industry loan book as you requested”.   \nThis was the first part of what came to be called the Transformation and made proposals \nfor the making of New Loans.  However, i t did not address the wider corporate loan \nportfolio, no r did it include all of the information specifically required by the NBU’s  5 \nOctober 2016 resolution . \n549. On the same day , but without waiting for the NBU’s approval , the Bank proceeded to \nimplement this part of the Transformation by making entries in its book s recording  the \nissue of the first UAH 20 billion of New Loans to five New Borrowers (Borand Trade  \nLLC , Business Prom Innovatsiya  LLC , Dream -Company  LLC , Khromia LLC and Like \nCity LLC ) all of which were used to repay the indebtedness of certain of the 44 \nBorrowers .  These New Loans  had been approved by the ECC at meetings attended by \nMs Gurieva, Mr Novikov, Mr Pikush, Ms Chmona and Mr Yatsenko  the previous day.  \nI am satisfied that this process was directed from senior levels within the Bank, \nincluding in particular Mr Dubilet, who had been  asked by Mr Yatsenko to approve the \nterms of the New Loans  on 19 October 2016.  On the basis of their involvement in the \nplanning of the Transformation, I accept that it is very likely that the instructions to do \nso came from Mr Kolomoisky to Mr Dubilet and were given with the approval of Mr \nBogolyubov.  \n550. By a l etter of engagement also dated  20 October 2016  (supplemented by  a Statement of \nWork dated 18 May 2017 ), Kroll was engaged by the NBU “to conduct an investigation \ninto the activities of  [the Bank], its Cyprus based branch  ... and its affiliate in Latvia  ..., \nduring the period 1 January 2007 until the date of nationalisation on 16 December \n2016 ”.  The report which was eventually produced and dated 29 November 2017 stated \nthat: \n“The overall objective of the investigation was to gather documentation and \nevidence to support a legal strategy for potential civil and criminal proceedings in \nmultiple jurisdictions. ” \n551. Ms Rozhkova was cross examined on the report on the basis that, although Kroll refer \nto a letter of engagement dated 20 October 2016, they were in fact engaged by the NBU \nfrom February 2016.

But it is not a t all clear to me that the development of a legal strategy \nfor potential civil and criminal proceedings in multiple jurisdictions  is the correct way \nof characterising what was agreed to be Kroll’s function as early as F ebruary 2016,  not \nleast because the reference to the Statement of Work dated 18 May 2017 shows that the \nscope of the engageme nt developed even after they were given their letter of \nengagem ent in October .  N or do I think there is any evidence that the following \nconclusions reached by Kroll by the time they did report were clearly identified at the \ntime they were originally instructed : \n“The investigation has identified a series of activities, which, taken together, \nindicate that the Bank was subjected to a large scale and coordinated fraud \ninvolving the former UBOs of the Bank (the  former UBOs'') and certain employees, \nover at least a ten year period, which resulted in the Bank suffering a loss of at least \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n139 \n USD 5.5 billion . The fraud involved loans being issued to a network of parties \nrelated to the former UBOs of the Bank and their affiliates .  Funds from these loans \nwere subjected to a mechanism to disguise the onward flows, through a series of \naccounts in the names  of shell companies controlled by the former UBOs or their \naffiliates, and were in part channelled to other destinations for the benefit of the \nformer UBOs or their affiliates. The loans, and the interest due on these loans, were \nthen repaid throu gh the issuing of new loans to other parties related to  the former \nUBOs, which in turn were repaid by further loans. During the Review Period, the \nrecycling of loans, the servicing of interest on those loans through issuing of new \nloans and the  continued extraction of funds for the benefit of the former UBOs and \ntheir affiliates began to take  on characteristics of a pyramid scheme, whereby new \nloans of ever increasing value had to b e issued to allow the scheme to continue. \nThis resulted in a material increa se in the loan book during  the Review Period. In \nlate 2016, the majority of this related party loan book was consolidated into loans \nto 36 borrowers which were related to the former UB Os and their affiliates. These \nloans  remain outstanding and the majority are overdue at the date of this report. \nThe Bank therefore suffered a loss of at least the value of these loans UAH 126.9 \nbillion (USD 5 .5 billion). ” \n552. On 27 October 2016 , Ms Rozhkova wrote to Mr Dubilet to point out that the form of \nTransformation plan provided by the Bank only contained information on restructuring \nthe loan debt for the petrochemical industry, and did not contain all the required terms, \nin particular as to repayment of existing loans, and the registration of collatera l.  The \nNBU therefore required the Bank to submit a plan for restructuring the entire corporate \nloan portfolio by 31 October 2016, taking into account the requirements set o ut in the \n5 October resolution and providing the specific dates for the “debt repayment \ntransactions and registration of collateral (in terms of counterparties)”.  \n553. The initial version of the proposed T ransformation plan was then amended in further \nversions of the plan sent by the Bank to the NBU  under cover of a series of letters during \nthe first half  of November 2016"}

The initial version of the proposed T ransformation plan was then amended in further \nversions of the plan sent by the Bank to the NBU  under cover of a series of letters during \nthe first half  of November 2016 .  The first draft of a more comprehensive \nTransformation plan covering UAH 111 billion (c.US$4.3 billion) of the corporate loan \nportfolio was submitted on 15  November 2016  followed by a final draft on 23 \nNovember, but a final version of the full Transformation plan was only formally \nsubmitted to the NBU on 28 November 2016 , ten days after the last of the New Loans \nhad been issued and recorded in the Bank’s books .  It listed the loans of the 193 \nBorrowers (including all but seven of the Borrowers and the Intermediary Borrowers:  \nthe three Cypriot Borrowers,  Kembel  LLC , Nautis Trade and Vegatorg (Borrowers) \nand Tinto LLC  (Intermediary Borrower) ) and the  36 New Borrowers  to which those \nloans were  to be transferred .  It also described the maturity dates of  the New Loans  (all \nof which were denominated in UAH ) almost all  of which stipulated for a repayment \ndate in 2024 , 2025  or 2026 (i.e., in 8 -10 years ’ time) , together with  the collateral by \nwhich they were all to be secured . \n554. In the event , New Loans amounting in total to UAH 126.9  billion (then equivalent to \nc.US$5  billion) were  recorded in the Bank ’s books as  having been issued by the Bank  \nto the New Borrowers  during the period 20 October 2016 to 18 November 2016 .  So \nfar as the Bank’s records were concerned, this amounted to completi on of  the \nTransformation , but as with the initial implementation of part of the Transformation on \n20 October 2016, the Bank sought to give effect  to the transfers of the borrowing \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n140 \n obligations to the New Borrowers before  the final dra ft of the Transformation plan had \neven been sent to the NBU , let alone approved by it .  The way this was done was  by \nclosing out those existing loan positions in the Bank’s books , and purporting to utilise \nthe proceeds of the New Loans to repay the debts of the  193 Borrowers . \n555. It is the Defendants’ case that Relevant Loans repaid via the Transformation totalled \nc.US$405.6 million and c.UAH 3 .075 billion.   It is also t he Defendants ’ case that \nIntermediary Loans were repaid via the Transformation ; they totalled US $56.5 million \nand UAH 7 .283.5 billion.   It is accepted by the Bank (and verified by Mr Thompson) \nthat these amounts reflected the figures recorded in the Bank’s transactional data for \nthe Relevant Loan and Intermediary Loans balances prior to the Transformation, the \ntotal amounts by which the outstanding balances were reduced by the Transformation \nand the closing balances on the Relevant Loans and the Intermediary Loans after the \nTransformation.    \n556. However, t he Transformation plan was never agreed with the  NBU  and it is the Bank’s \ncase that the way in which the whole exercise was carried out amounted t o an attempt \nto present the NBU with  a fait accompli , artificial and deficient though it was .  Ms \nRozhkova accepted that the  NBU allowed the Bank to complete what was an \nunapproved transformation  “under their own responsibility ”, but the reasons it took the \napproach it did was  because of the  early October shareholders ’ letter  from the \nIndividual Defendan ts.  As she put it in cross -examination: “ In this letter, the \nshareholders promised us to do this restructuring according to the requirements which \nNBU  provided before, so that's why we did not stop these activities, and to have \npossibility to check "}

In my view that is an accurate description of what occurred.  Despite the fact that the \nIndividual Defendants initially ran a p ositive case that the Transformation was devised \nand implemented by the NBU, i t is clear that the Bank pr oceeded to issue New Loans \nand record the repayment of existing loans in its books without waiting for the NB U to \nagree  to any of the details of Transformation plan, and the clear inference is that it must \nhave been done deliberately .  The final dra ft of the Transformation plan was only \nreceived by the NBU  after the recording of the Transformation in the Bank’s books  was \neffectively complete.   \n558. Furthermore, t he Bank does not accept that the transactions  recorded in its books \nreflected the true legal consequences of what had occurred .  It submitted  that the making \nof the New Loans and the application of their proceeds in the manner I have described \ndid not amount to a genuine repayment of the debt owed by the 193 Borrowers  and \nmore specifically any amounts in respect of the Relevant Loans .  This is a point to \nwhich I shall return . \n559. At the same time as the various version s of the Bank’s Transformation plan were being \nsent to the NBU,  the process of releasing the Share Pledges  (which I have already \ndescribed in paragraphs 359ff above)  was completed .  The Share Pledges were not \ndischarged as a “consequence” of repayment of the 193 Borrowers’ loans as alleged by \nMr Kolomoisky. They were the subject of termination agreements signed by the Share \nPledgor and the Bank.   However, although d raft replacement  pledges  over the same \nshare s that would have provided purported security for the New Loans  were prepared , \nthey were never executed , the initial delay being excused as a result of “delays in \ntransporting documents” .  EY were told by the Bank  (and recorded this in the EY \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n141 \n November 2016 Report, although the precise source of the information is not disclosed)  \nthat, although the New Borrowers were shell companies with no assets, they were \nexpected to “take over the business from other companies (the ‘donor companies’) \nowned by the ultimate beneficiaries of the new borrowers” .  \n560. The Bank’s case is that the New Borrowers were also all owned and/or controlled by \nMr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov,  and because they had not yet received a transfer \nof the businesses from what were called the ‘donor companies’ they had no  \ncreditworthiness  and were not “operating companies” with “real and transparent” \nsources of income.   Similarly, it was also said that the collateral for the New Loans \nconsisted of worthless pledges over supply agreements that would never be performed .  \nAll of this meant that the  security, like the New Loans themselves , was plainly \ninadequate and failed  to comply  with the NBU ’s requiremen ts for the Transformation . \nThere was no explanation as to why the ‘donor companies’ themselves which did have \nvaluable assets could not have become obligors under the New Loans.  \n561. Part of Mr Kolomoisky’s case was that he had no substantial involvement in the \nTransformation process.

He pleaded that implementation of the Transformation was \nsupervised and controlled by the curator (Ms Domashenko) and other NBU staff within \nthe Bank .  He said that they did so by  review ing the legal and credit files of all \nborrowers , determin ing whether potential New Borrowers were related parties , \ndirect ing the Bank to use the 36 New Borrowers as grantees of N ew Loans to be  used \nto repay the loans which  had been made to the  193 Borrowers , overseeing  the \nrepayment by the New Borrowers of the loans outstanding from  the 193 Borrowers  and \nbeing  aware of the arrangements to be made to secure the loans to the New Borrowers.  \n562. This case was plead ed in two different but linked contexts.  The first was in support of \nMr Kolomoisky’s allegation that the NBU was concerned to bankrupt the Bank as part \nof a campaign against him.  This aspect of his case  was abandoned in opening.  The \nsecond was in support of his pleaded case that any loss suffered by the Bank in respect \nof the loans to the 193 Borrowers outstanding prior to the Transformation (including \nthe Relevant Loans) was caused by the NBU and/or by the Bank acting under the \ncontro l of the NBU and not by Mr Kolomoisky.  \n563. In addition to his pleaded case,  the manner in which the Relevant Loans and the \nIntermediary Loans were dealt with by the Bank and the NBU as part of the \nTransformation  was referred to in Mr Kolomoisky ’s closing submissions  in the context \nof the Repayment Defence .  In particular it was referred to in relation to an argument \nbased on the Bank’s choice  to allocate  repayment s to the liability of the Borrowers as \nopposed to any other liabilities .  I summarised  this argument in the introductory section \nof this judgment . \n564. The Defendants’ argument based on the Bank ’s choice to allocate was first advanced  \nin its current form  in Mr Kolomoisky’s  written closing submissions , and ultimately \ndepends on what the Bank did or did not cho ose to do post -nationalisation .  The fact \nthat the argument was not based on what  occurred p re-nationalisation is because Mr \nKolomoisky explicitly eschew ed reliance on the fact that the Bank initially credited the \nBorrowers with repayment “while it was owned and arguably controlled by ” him.  The \ncase he sought to advance in his closing submissions was that the Bank had an \nopportunity post-nationalisation  to decide which loans to treat as valid and repaid and \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n142 \n consciously decided to treat the New Loans as valid and outstanding and the loans to \nthe 193 Borrowers as having been repaid , a position that it has maintained to this day.  \n565. I will come back to this way of putting Mr Kolomoisky’s case  later in this judgment  \n(and t he extent to which the pleaded case on loss was still pursued in closing was \nunclear ), but for present purposes, I need  to make factual fin dings in response to both \nwhat was pleaded and what was said in his closing submissions about the \nTransformation -related conduct of the Bank and the NBU pre -nation alisation . \n566. In his closing submissions Mr Kolomoisky  expressed his case as to the role of the NBU \nas follows:  \n“Throughout 2015 and 2016 when the Bank and the NBU knew all about the \nSupply Agreement Fraud Allegations  and the misuse of loans for the benefit of [Mr \nKolomoisky], the NBU could have required the Bank to declare the Relevant and \nIntermediary Loans void, but it did not do so. Instead, the NBU and the Bank \ntogether determined a plan which would treat them all as valid with a view to \nsecuring their repayment  or collateralisation:  \n(1) The NBU req"}
{"start": 532000, "text": "e as to the role of the NBU \nas follows:  \n“Throughout 2015 and 2016 when the Bank and the NBU knew all about the \nSupply Agreement Fraud Allegations  and the misuse of loans for the benefit of [Mr \nKolomoisky], the NBU could have required the Bank to declare the Relevant and \nIntermediary Loans void, but it did not do so. Instead, the NBU and the Bank \ntogether determined a plan which would treat them all as valid with a view to \nsecuring their repayment  or collateralisation:  \n(1) The NBU required a Restructuring of the Bank which involved in part the \nrepayment of loans (including Relevant and Intermediary Loans) in return for \nTransferred Assets and the Transformation of existing loans into New Loans.  \n(2) The Transformation of the remaining loans to the 193 Borrowers involved the \nadvance of funds to 36 New Borrowers. Although the NBU knew at the time \nthat the New Loans did not comply with its requirements, the NBU allowed the \nBank to make those loans and di d not intervene. ” \n567. The way it was put in closing therefore accepts a less assertive role for the NBU than \nthe way this part of Mr Kolom oisky’s  case was pleaded .  However, it remains the \nposition that he alleges that the NBU allowed the Bank to make the New Loans and did \nnot intervene.  The Bank’s position is that such an allegation, like the pleaded case, was \nalways inherently incredible , was wholly  inconsistent with the documents and the \nagreed purpose of the Transformation  and was unsupported by  the evidence of any \nwitness.    \n568. It is clear that the NBU knew and intended that the restructuring of the Bank’s corporate \nlending portfolio (as contemplated by what became the Transformation) would involve \nwhat Ms Rozhkova called the transfer of bad debts held by customers with low \ncredi tworthiness to affiliated companies with, for example, profitable operating \nbusinesses.  As I have already explain ed this was one of the recapitalisation measures \nwhich had been suggested in the IMF’s September 2016 memorandum.  However, t he \ndocuments make  clear that the detail of the Transformation was arranged by employees \nwithin BOK  (such as Ms Gurieva and Ms Koryak ) and the n transmitted to the NBU by \nMr Yatsenko , or in one instance Mr Pikush , after the New Loans had been issued and \nrepayments of the old loans  had been recorded .  The NBU did not participate in \nidentifying the New Borrowers, agreeing the terms of the New Loans or the extent of \nthe collateral given to the Bank as security for the New Loans.   It is clear that this was \nall dealt with within B OK. \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n143 \n 569. Furthermore, n one of the communications arranging the New Loans was copied to the \nNBU until such time as the various draft s of the Transformation plan itself were sent to \nthe NBU by Mr Yatsenko or Mr Pikush as the case may be , and there is no mention or \nsuggest ion in any of the documentation  that the NBU played any role in the Bank’s \ndecisions as to the identity of the entities which were to participate as New Borrowers .  \nIn particular there is no evidence that, at the time the relevant entries were made in the \nBank’s books , the NBU knew that the New Loans did not comply with its requirements,  \nor indeed that it di d anything which cons tituted “allowing” the Bank to make loans to \nthe New Borrowers in the first place.  \n570. So far as  NBU  individuals  or groups of individua ls “within the Bank” are concerned , \ntwo are relevant: the inspector Mr Shekmar  (and his team) and the curator, Ms \nDomashenko .  Mr Shekmar ’s unchallenged evidence was clear on this point.

It did not have the power to give, \nand did not give, instructions to the Bank.  He also said that they  were only informed \nof the New Loans after they had been issued and were only provided with files  for the \nNew Borrowers after that (and upon request).   Ms Domashenko’s unchallenged \nevidence was clear as well.  She confirm ed that she observed and reported on the steps \ntaken by the Bank pursuant to the Transformation plan, but that she did not have any \ncontrol over, or supervise, its implementation, nor did she  play a part in  selecting the \nNew Borrowers.  \n571. I accept  Ms Rozhkova’ s evid ence that , in light of the way in which the Transformation \nwas conducted , the Defendants are wrong to suggest that the NB U had any \nresponsibility for  select ing any of  the 36 New B orrowers  or for instruct ing the issue of \nNew Loans to any of them.   This was a process controlled by the Bank under the overall \nsupervision of Mr Kolomoisky, the detail of which was not approved by the  NBU.   \nThere is clear evidence that, like the Borrowers and the Intermediary Borrowers, the \nNew Borrowers  were shell  companies  which were very far removed from the  types of \nreplacement borrower , which the NBU had in mind in order to assist in rec apitalising \nthe Bank in light of the extreme weakness of the covenants of much of its loan book, \nincluding in particular the debts due from the Borrowers and the Intermediary \nBorrowers.  \n572. As to  the role played by Mr Kolomoisky, I do not accept his pleaded case that he had \nno substantial involvement in the process.  I am satisfied that h e was closely involved \nin all of the arrangements and what was done was only done with the approval of both \nhim and Mr Bogolyubov .  Dealing first with Mr Kolomoisky’s role, I accept as accurate \nthe following description given by Ms Rozhkova in her evidence:  \n“I knew that Mr Kolomoisky was deeply involved in the decision to enter into the \nTransformation and it was clear to me from my prior discussions with Mr \nKolomoisky that steps such as those associated with the Transformation Plan would \nnot have been taken by the Bank without the approval of Mr Kolomoisky.”  \n573. Mr Bogolyubov’s role is less easy to discern.  It is clear that he was committed to the \nTransformation because he was a signatory to the letter to the NBU which is referred \nto in paragraphs 538 and 539 above.  There is also evidence that Mr Kolomoisky always \nmade clear that Mr Bogolyubov would need to be consulted before any further \nrecapitalisation measures could be agreed.  This is not surprising as both recapitalisation \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n144 \n and the nationalisation of the Bank which was ever -present in what might happen would \nhave a fundamental impac t on his continuing interest as a major shareholder  of the \nBank . \n574. Ms Rozhkova’s evidence is  consistent with and supportive of the inferences which arise \nin any event  in relation to both of  the Individual Defendants .  It was they who had the \ninterests in the underlying businesses owned by the ‘donor companies’ I have already \nidentified, and it was they who were the owners and controllers of the New Borrowers, \nwhich EY had called shell companies with no assets , and which were expected to take \nover the business es of the ‘donor companies’ .

They were  the owners and controller s of \nmore than 90% of the equity in the Bank  and were  also very substantial borrowers from \nthe Bank, in particular through the interests they had in the Borrowers themselves , the \nloans to many of which were intended to be replaced by the New Loans which were the \nsubject matter of the Transformation.  \n575. Given these interest s, and given the extent of the obvious pressure from the NBU to \nrecapi talise the Bank , it is in my judgment inconceivable that the  Individual Defendants  \ndid not both know and approve of the terms of the Transformation , including the nature \nand identity of the New Borrowers and the facts that they themselves had limited \nresources from which to repay their obligations under the New Loans.  \n576. On 22 November 2016, which was s hortly before the final version of the Bank’s \nTransformation plan was presented to the NBU, EY completed the EY November 2016 \nReport which was then sent to the Bank and the NBU.  It  concluded amongst other \nthings  that the Bank required additional regulatory capital of between UAH 138.9 \nbillion and UAH 146.4 billion (the US$ equivalent of which was then c.US$5.43 to \nUS$5.72 billion) .  For current purposes , there were two other significant groups of \nfindings.   The first is  the commentary it gave  on the fair value of collateral and tangible \nassets included in the Bank’s assets lists , a matter to which I will return  later in this \njudgment  when explaining my findings on the true value of the Transferred Assets.  \n577. The second is that it records t he results of EY’s analysis of the New Borrowers’ \nfinancial statements and security agreements, and its preliminary analysis of credit risk \non the restructured portfolio.   In EY’s view, the New Borrowers’ financial statements \nindicated a low probability of repayment of interest and principal, and that neither the \ncollateral that had been put in place (over contractual rights) , nor the security that was \nanticipa ted by the Transformation plan (over corporate rights) would meet the NBU’s \nrequirements .  It also  noted that the Bank’s management had claimed that it planned to \nreplace pledges  over corporate rights with mortgages of physical assets from the same \ncompanies, but that  no such security had been put in place.  \n578. EY’s conclusions w ere consistent with the information provided by the New Borrowers \nin support of their loan applications .  Even if taken at face value, they manifestly lacked \neither the income or assets necessary to repay the New Loans.  Thus, by way of \nexample, the SOFs demonstrate that, in their financial statements for the most recent \nperiod before the issuance of their New Loans,  ten of the  36 New Borrowers reported \nno significant assets or revenue  and 30 of the 36 New  Borrowers reported losses .  It \nwas also clear that the Transformation involved the Bank losing the limited security it \nhad for the existing loans to the 193 Borrowers ( this included the Share Pledges ), \nwithout receiving any genuine security for the New Loan s.  The only security obtained \nby the Bank was pledges over what were said to be  contractual rights to receive goods \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n145 \n which plainly did not amount to the proper collateral  contemplated and required by \nresolution  323-rsh/BT.  \n579.

Ms Rozhkova agreed with this suggestion, but I do not think she was right to do \nso and  I agree with the Bank’s response that  the suggestion  is wrong . The Bank’s \ncurrency position was not improved by converting its assets from a stable currency \n(US$) into a depreciating currency (UAH).   The extent of the Bank’s exposure to \ncurrency risk meant that if the  Bank’s depositors had chosen to seek repayment of their  \nUS$ deposits, the Ban k would not have been able to finance the payments from its own \nUS$ assets  and would have been required to purchase US $ on the open market, using \nits UAH resources  to do so. In circumstances in which the UAH  was depreciating, that \nwas a perilous position for the Bank  to be in . \n580. The Bank submitted, and I accept , that b y contrast, it was a  very beneficial position for \nthe Individual Defendants, as  the owners and controllers of the New Borrowers .  The \nvalue in US $ of their indebtedness  under the New Loans  would continue to  reduc e as \nthe depreciation of  the UAH  continued .  I shall return to this poi nt when considering  \nthe arguments as to the appropriate currency in which the Bank  ought to be entitled to \nrecover compensation, with which I will deal at the end of this judgment.  \n581. Not long after the final version of the Transformation plan  was submitted to the NBU , \nthe Bank began to postpone payment of its debts , at which stage Ms Rozhkova \nconcluded that the Bank would need to be nationalised, in order  to protect both its  20 \nmillion ordinary customers and the Ukrainian financial system more generally .  On 14 \nDecember 2016 the NBU notified the Bank that it had determined by resolution the \nprevious day that 1,092 entities were related parties to the Bank .  The list included all \n36 of  the New Borrowers and a very significant number of the Borrowers  (some 28 in \naddition  to those which had been identified in 2015)  and Intermediary Borrowers . \n582. On 16 December  2016 , Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov wrote to Volodymyr \nGroysman, then the Prime Minister of Ukraine, with a formal request that the \ngovernment acquire the shares in the Bank .  This letter  included a promise to restructure \nthe Bank’s loan portfolio by 1 July 2017 through the provision of independently valued \ncollateral , with what was said to be a potential continuation of this deadline until 1 \nJanuary 20 18 so long as  75% had been  restructured by 1 July 2017 .  In her evidence , \nMs Rozhkova sa id that, in the light of what Mr Kolomoisky had said when suggesting \na solvent nationalisation, she considered that, in making those promises, Mr \nKolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov were probably seeking  to avoid criminal liability for \ntheir actions in relation to the Bank.  In their closing submissions this letter was referred \nto by the Bank and the Individual Defendants as the Nationalisation Letter.  \n583. On Sunday 18 December 2016, the NBU resolved  to declare the Bank insolven t.  The \nresolution recorded many of the events of t he previous year which I have alre ady \nsummarised, that the Bank's regulatory capital (H1) ratio was negative  and that its H2 \nRatio was also inadequate .  It also recorded that the Bank’s managers and shareholders \nhad failed to ensure the implementation of the Restructuring Plan and that the overdue \ndebt to the NBU was UAH 14.2 billion as of 16 December 2016.  It stated that the Bank \nwas therefore to be nationalised.   On the same day, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Comm"}

On the same day, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n146 \n passed Resolution 961 under which , in accordance with Article 41 -1 of the  Ukrainian \nLaw on Deposit Guarantee Fund (the “DGF  Law”), the Ministry of Finance was \nempowered to purchase the entire issued share capital of the Bank for UAH 1 and the \nBank issued additional shares in itself to the Ministry of Finance in exchange for UAH \n116.8bn (US$4.45bn) of bonds issued by the government of  Ukraine.  \n584. The following day the DGF passed a series of resolutions  which introduced the \ntemporary administration of the Bank for the period of one month and began the process \nof withdrawing the Bank from the market , a process which was to be implemented \nthrough a procedure for the State, represented by the Ministry of  Finance, to become \nthe shareholder of the Bank. From that point onwards, the Individual Defendants were \nno longer  able to exercise control of the Bank through their shareholdings and many of \nthe members of its senior management left the Bank.  \n \nThe period  between nationalisation and the commencement of thes e proceedings  \n585. The details of w hat happened next are primarily relevant to the Limitation Defence, but \nmuch of it is also now of real significance to the new way in  which the Defendants put \nthe Repayme nt Defence .  This is because of the emphasis which they now place on \nwhat are said to  be manifestations of the Bank’s post -nationalisation choice  to treat the \nBorrowers as having repaid their liabilities in respect of the Relevant Loans . \n586. On 21 Decembe r 2016, Mr Shlapak was appointed chairman of the Manageme nt Board, \na position which he held until 25 July 2017.  Two days later, on 23 December 2016 , Ms \nPakhachuk join ed the Management Board.   Her evidence gave a n illuminating \ndescription of what the Bank’s new management found when they went in .  This \ndescription, like the summary of what occurred more generally between the time of \nnationalisation an d the commencem ent of these proceedings, is  relevant to part of the \nLimitation Defence .  The following relatively lengthy citation from Ms Pakhachuk’s  \nwitness statement  speaks for itself and in my judgment is an accurate summary of the \ndifficulties with which the Bank’s new ma nagement were faced : \n“13.  It is difficult to overstate the complexity and pressure faced by the new \nmanagement team as we took over the administration of the Bank at the end of \n2016.   The Bank is the largest bank in Ukraine and is of systemic importance to \nUkraine’s banking sector as a whole. In 2016, around half of Ukrainians had an \naccount with PrivatBank.  \n14.  I can recall clearly that our immediate priority after nationalisation was to \ninvestigate the Bank’s liquidity problems and the resumption of the Bank’s \nliquidity management.   The nationalisation of the Bank in December 2016 had \nprotected it from insolvency, but the Bank also had an enormous cash flow \nproblem: it had liabilities reaching more than USD 6 billion, whereas the cash \navailable was only about USD 70 million, and custo mers were regularly \nwithdrawing their deposits.   All of us on the Managemen t Board understood that if \nthe Bank could not remain liquid, there was a real risk of mass withdrawal of \ndeposits, with millions of Ukrainians being unable to access their savings.

All of us on the Managemen t Board understood that if \nthe Bank could not remain liquid, there was a real risk of mass withdrawal of \ndeposits, with millions of Ukrainians being unable to access their savings. Ukraine \nwas, at that time,  already in a very difficult position politically and economically – \nit was dealing with the aftermath of the Revolution of Dignity and the Russian \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n147 \n annexation of Crimea and fighting in the east.   We were all aware that civil unrest \nwas a real possibility if ordinary Ukrainians became unable to access their deposits \nat the Bank.   For these reasons, at the outset there was no real focus or thought \ngiven to investigating and preparing civil claims against the Former Owners.  \n15.  The first few months following nationalisation were extremely busy in terms \nof work.   In addition to the issues pertaining to the great problems on securing \nliquidity, we also had to  take charge of all the other aspects necessary to operate an \nenormous commercial entity.   That included building a new organisational \nstructure almost from scratch by virtue of the fact that the previous heads of many \nof the main divisions, for example Timur Novikov (who headed the Investment \nBusiness Department) and Tatia na Gurieva (who headed the Customer Services \nDepartment, BOK) simply left after the nationalisation without any  proper transfer \nof their work or even of their documents  to the complexes of the bank and the \narchive, as well as consideration of all the day -to-day management decisions and \nbuilding up an understanding of how the Bank had operated in the past across all \nareas of the business.   All of us on the Management Board were at our absolute \nlimit.   Our typical hours for January and February were from 8 am to 10  pm every \nday of the week (i.e. including weekends ).  In March 2017, we started to stabilise \nthe work and our work schedules to save our energy to have some free time on \nSunday, but it was many months before we reached anything like standard working \nhours.”  \n587. This evidence was corroborated by Ms Rozhkova, who explained in her evidence that \nthe period following the Bank’s nationalisation was a hugely challenging time for her \npersonally.  She said that all of her efforts were focused on the NBU’s communications \nwith the public and in particular the Bank’s customers, in order to instil confidence that \ntheir money was safe and to avoid a run on the Bank.  \n588. Also on 23 December 2016, NashiGroshi published an article entitled “The scheme of \nwithdrawal of funds from Privatbank by the Kolomoisky - Bogolyubov -Dubilet Group”.   \nIt reported that since January 2014, c.US$4.27 billion ha d been withdrawn abroad from \nthe Bank  which was close to its Bloomberg -estimated  capital deficit of c.US $5.5 \nbillion.   It also reported that:  \n“The most significant amount of $1.82bn was loaned out in May -August 2014 to \n42 companies with PrivatBank roots. They transferred funds as a full prepayment \nto a British company for certain goods to an account at PrivatBank Cyprus branch. \nOnly after that, the Ukrainian company made an agreement with PrivatBank that \nthe collateral for the previously taken loan was the property rights to the goods that \nhad not yet been delivered from the British. The British company would then \ninform the Ukrainian company tha t it could not deliver the goods and terminate the \nagreement with the Ukrainian company without returning the funds. Read more \nabout the scheme in the article The National Bank Overlooked Privat's Billions .” \n589. This article was therefore reporting the gist of some of the allegations which are now \nmade in these proceedings.  It was one of a number of articles  published towards the "}

Read more \nabout the scheme in the article The National Bank Overlooked Privat's Billions .” \n589. This article was therefore reporting the gist of some of the allegations which are now \nmade in these proceedings.  It was one of a number of articles  published towards the \nend of 2016 and in January 2017 , which examined in some detail the nature of the \nBank’s corporate loan book and the pervasive extent of related party lending  (i.e., to \nborrowers related to the Individual Defendants ).  They included one  published on 12 \nSeptember 2016  by Antiraid , an article published on 1 November 2016  by \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n148 \n BneIntelliNews  and an article published by VoxUkraine 2017  on 20 January  2017 \nentitled “Good bank, bad shareholder, evil regulator.”  \n590. In the immediate aftermath of nationalisation, the NBU had a role in formulating the \npriorities to be addressed by the new members of the Supervisory Board.  Thus, on 6 \nJanuary 2017, the acting Governor of the NBU wrote to the Supervisory Board drawing \nits attention to a set of priority issues requiring prompt resolution .  Not surprisingly \nthese f ocussed on steps required to ensure the Bank’s future viability and planning for \nappropriate increases in its capital gi ven the low quality of its corporate loan p ortfolio.   \nThere was specific mention of the Individual Defendants ’ 16 December 2016 \nundertaking to the Prime Minister  to ensure a complete  restructuring of the corporate \nloan portfolio , with high quality security . There was also a process of what was called \n“on-boarding” involving the Ministry of Finance, in which members of the Bank’s new \nmanagement were given briefings in relation to the Bank and its affairs . \n591. On 17 January 2017, the first meeting of the Bank’s  post-nationalisation, Supervisory \nBoard t ook place. It appointed EY as the Bank’s auditors and instruct ed them  to perform \na detailed investigation into the Bank’s capital and asset position, including an analysis \nof the Bank’s collateral position on its full loan portfolios, including its loans to related \nparties.  At the same time a new unit, to be headed by Sergiy Stratonov, was set up \nwithin the Bank , the function of which was to oversee what Ms Pakhachuk called “ all \nissues related to the Bank’s portfolio of lending to parties related to the [Individual \nDefendants ]”.  \n592. Later the same month , on 26 January 2017,  the Management Board ma de a number  of \nsignificant changes to the personnel in the Bank’s legal department , which was required \nbecause of the new managem ent’s concerns that the existing staff were loyal to the \nIndividual Defendants .  On the same day Mr Shlapak signed an order establishing a \ncommission to conduct an official investigation into loans made  by the Bank after it \nitself had receiv ed refinancing loans from the NBU in the period 2014  to 2016 .  It was \nmeant t o report by 24 February 2017.  The members of the commission were the head \n(Taras Levadskiy ) and two members of the Bank’s  department of criminal prosecution \nand legal protection.   It was suggested by the Defendants that Mr Levadskiy may have \nbeen appointed to chair the commission because he was already familiar with the issues \nhaving been involved in the Bank’s response to the GPO investigation  during the course \nof 2015  and that may indeed have been at least one of the reasons for his appointment . \n593.

Whether  Mr Levadskiy’s commission reported within its intended timescale was not \nclear ; Ms Pakhachuk did not recall seeing any report , although she was aware in general \nterms of his investigation .  The content of what it discovered was not in evidence either , \nbecause there was no copy of any report in the trial bundles , although there was some \nevidence that it existed because  a document described as  a Copy of the conclusion dated \n10.03. 2017 “On the results of the official investigation into the facts of iss uance by the \nBank of loans to legal entities and individuals after receiving NBU loans for refinancing \nin 2014 -2016 ” was listed in a search report initiated by the  National Anti -Corruption \nBureau of Ukraine  on 6 July 2017 . \n594. In these circumstances, it was submitted on behalf of Mr Kolomoisky that it  should be \nreadily  inferred from its non -disclosure that the contents of the Levadskiy Report would \nonly serve to confirm that the Bank’s new management already knew everything that it \nneeded to know about the Misappropriation  to bring proceedings at that time  (i.e., 10 \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n149 \n March 2017).  On the basis of what I have seen , I can infer that it is  likely that a report \nexists and that privilege has been claimed for it .  However, o n the assumption  that \nlitigation privilege was claimed , the most that can be said is that it is likely that the \nreport was obtained for the dominant purpose of potential use in contemplated \nlitigation , although  the available information does not identify the form which that \nlitigation might take .  On that basis, it is difficult to draw the inference for wh ich Mr \nKolomoisky contends ; I cannot say that it is likely that it established that all of the facts \nnecessary to prove  the Bank’s claim s were, as a result of the report, pleadable  as such.  \n595. On 30 January 2017, t he NBU sen t the results of Mr Shekmar’s 17 October 2016 \nunscheduled inspection to the Bank .  He de scribed the main achievement of the \nTransformation as being “ the currency restructuring and elimination of groupings of \ncounterparties that are associated both with one another and with the Bank ”.  But he \nwent on to say that t he nature of the transactions performed and the inadequacy of the \nscope of the activities of the N ew Borrowers , which were generally newly created \ncompanies, testif ied to  its artificiality and the fact that it did  not actually  reduce the \nBank’s risks.  \n596. Mr Stratonov reported back to the Supervisory Board on the opera tion of his new \ndepartment on 6 March  2017 .  He explain ed that it had started work in February , that it \nhad hired five lawyers, that there were 230 credit cases under its mandate, that \ninspection of collateral would be completed by a team of 300 people by 31 March 2017, \nthat decisions on a revaluation of collateral would be made by 30  April 2017 and  that a \nseparate archive of credit documents would be created by the same date.   I shall come \nback to the inspections in the context of my findings on the valuation of the Transferred \nAssets.  He also reported on outstanding debt as of 1 March 2017 and referred to the \nBank having sent letters to all related party debtors requesting immediate payment of \noverdue interest and the  provision of additional collatera l. \n597. On 19 March 2017,  EY produced a lengthy report entitled “Report on the results of \nanalysis of the capital need of  Privatbank”  (the “EY Capital Report”).

A further version \nwas produced on 3 April 2017.  Mr Oleksiyenko pointed out  in his evidence that the \nscope of EY’s work was focussed on analysing the Bank’s capital and asset position \nand advising on the extent of the Bank’s requirement for additional capital.  He also \nsaid that a t no point were EY instructed to assist in the identification of potential claims \nthat the Bank might have as a result of this analysis, or otherwise.   He also said that \nEY’s report made for stark reading for the Supervisory Board, explaining that: “We had \na fair idea of the types of issues that EY identif ied, from sources such as Mr Stratonov’s \nreport, but it was still a sobering experience to have that information set out by highly \nexperienced third -party  advisors ”. \n598. Ms Pakhachuk also remembered being very struck by EY’ s conclusions : “it was the \npoint at which I began to think that things at the Bank really could be worse than we \neven imagined ”.  One of its ‘Key Conclusions’ was that  the total credit risk assessed by \nEY as of 19 December 2016 in a conservative scenario was UAH 222.3 billion  and that , \nin that same scenario , the e ffective rate of reservation for corporate loans was 98%. \nBased on the results of the EY analysis, 164 corporate borrowers of the 168 analysed \nhad a default probability of 100% on the applicati on of the appropriate regulatory \ncriteria.   As a result of the Supervisory Board’s consideration of the EY Capital Report  \non 26 April 2017, the Bank sought a capital injection from the NBU  in the sum of UAH \n38.565 billion.   \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n150 \n 599. The 98% impairment on the New Loans described in the EY Capital Report was \nrecognised in the Bank’s first post -nationalisation financial statements signed off on  25 \nMay 2017.   EY’s auditor’s report contained a comprehensive d isclaimer of opinion on \nthe financial performance and cash flows in these financial statements, but the footnote \nrelevant to the 98% loan impairme nt recorded as follows:  \n“In October - November 2016, the Group restructured a part of its loan portfolio \nwith a total value of UAH 137,082 million before allowance for impairment as at \n31 December 2016. During the restructuring, the Group changed loans currency to \nUAH, lowered in terest rates, extended maturity of loans to 2024 and 2025, \nconverted some of loans into finance lease and changed collateral pledged under \nloans.  As at 31 December 2016, the Group recognised UAH 135,018 million of \nallowance for impairment under these loans .” \n600. Meanwhile , one week after the first version of the EY Capital Report was produced, \nthe Supervisory Board approved terms of reference for an internationally recognised \nfirm to  be hired to  negotiate the restructuring, collateralisation and collection of what \nwere called the impaired loans of the Individual Defendants or parties directly or \nindirectly related to them.  The terms of reference provide d for an 11-week assignment \nstarting in mid -April, with  a two-week period for developing a strategy and a nine -week \nperiod for its implementation .  On 13 A pril 2017, a  consortium led by Rothschild  & Co  \nwas appointed to conduct negotiations with the Individual Defendant s for what the \nminutes recorded as the “restructuring, collateralization and collection of the impaired \nloans, other exposures and financial leasing outstanding, of the UBOs or of parties \ndirectly or indirectly related to the former UBOs to maximize their value ”.

This was a \nreference to the commitments the Individual Defendants had undertaken in the \nNationalisation Letter.  The Bank issued a press release announcing the appointment \non 6 May 2017.  \n601. Mr Oleksiyenko , who was not personally involved in supervising Rothschild’s work \nbut was updated on it along with the rest of the Supervisory Board , remembered being \ntold that that Rothschild had had a handful of meetings and a larger number of phone \ncalls with the Individual Defendants  and their representatives.  This was confirmed by \nMr Shlapak in a letter he wrote to the Minister of Finance on 18 July 2017 in which he  \nsaid that Rothschild had had four meetings with the  Individual Defendants, whom he \ncalled the  “Former UBOs” and that they would report back to the Supervisory Board \non 20 July 2017.  \n602. On 14 June 2017 , Mr Kolo moisky commenced judicial review proceedings against the \nNBU, the Cabinet of Ministers, the DGF and the National Securities and Stock Market \nCommission , seeking a  declar ation of  unlawful ness and a cancel lation of the  decisions \nresulting in the Bank’s nationalisation .  This was two weeks before the expiry of the 1 \nJuly 2017  deadline under  the Nationalisation Le tter to restructure at least 75% of the \nBank’s corporate loan portfolio , which did not occur.  Although negotiations with  the \nIndividual Defendants  continue d, it seems lik ely that this development made a material \ncontribu tion to no deal being reached , because Ms  Rozhkova was recorded in an article \npublished by Economic Pravda on 22 June 2017  as having told Finbalance the \nfollowing : \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n151 \n “The lawsuit is about contesting the recognition of Privatbank as insolvent and \nnationalization. In the lawsuit, Mr. Kolomoiskyi wrote about raiding by the state ” \nand \n“How can we hope for success in the restructuring [of insider loans, - ed.], if the \nex-owner of the bank, despite the fact that there are letters with his obligations, \ngoes to court, files a lawsuit to declare the NBU's decision on recognition illegal\" \nPrivatbank\" is insolvent, according to the decision on nationalization, as well as all \nsureties? ” \n603. It is not possible to say that th is was the moment it was clear to the Bank that the terms \nof the Nationalisation Letter would not be complied with or whether there was still hope \nfor a negot iated solution and that realisation only crystalised  the following month.  The \nminutes of the 20 July 2017  Supervisory Board  meeting record that it  received an update \nfrom Rothschild on the progress  of the negotiations, although how that progress wa s \ndescribed is not apparent .  This was the last meeting attended by Mr Shlapak as chair \nof the Management Board , and he  reported on what was called  “the status of the loan \nportfolio related to the ex -owners of the Bank” .  His report , which was described by Ms \nPakhachuk as “so stark as to be inherently memorable”  and was regarded by her as the \nreally decisive moment for the Bank in deciding to investigate the possibility of \nbringing  civil claims against the Individual Defendants .  It was accompanied by a 126 -\npage PowerPoint presentation entitled “Problem assets of PrivatBank” .   Some of the \nslides to which my attention  was drawn showed a huge reduction in interest receipts in \nrespect of the New Loans.  \n604.

At a meeting of the Management Board held on 27 July 2017 , which was the first one \nchaired by Ms Pakhachuk after the resignation of Mr S hlapak , Yaroslav Matuzka, then \nhead of the Bank’s legal department , reported that it was unlikely that the Rothschild \nnegotiations would result in an  agreement between the Bank and the Individual \nDefendants .  He suggested  that, if the purpose of the negotiations with the Individual \nDefendants  was not achieved , Hogan Love lls should be instructed to begin preparing a \nclaim in the English Court once “ the matter has been agreed with th e Supervisory Board \nand the Ministry of Finance ”.  The Defendants submitted that it is clear that , by 27 July \n2017, the Bank had also received advice that it could su e in England.  I agree that, given \nthe nature of Mr Matuzka’s recommendation, it is likely that the Bank had already been \nadvised that  it should be possible for  the causes of action , which might be avail able to \nit, to be pursued in the English courts.  \n605. Mr Matuzka’s  recommendation was accepted and  the Management Board resolve d to \ninstruct Hogan Lovells , once the approval of the Supervisory Board had been obtained , \nwhich it was at a meeting held on 3 August 201 7.  Hogan Lovells were then formally \ninstructed on 7 August 2017.  \n606. Ms Pakhachuk explained in her evidence that, by  this point, the position had changed \nsubstantially from that in the early months following nationalisation . In particular , she \nsaid that the position of the related party lending portfolio had continued to deteriorate, \nthat the levels of overdue interest and principal payments had reached concerning levels  \nand that the new management’s  understanding of the Bank’s position was substantially \nmore developed, as a result of the work which had been done by Mr Stratonov, EY and \nMr Shlapak . However, she said that litigation with the Individual Defendants was not \nthe Bank’s preferred option. Consistently with the way in which Mr Matuzka’s \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n152 \n recommendation to the Management Board was expressed, t he new management all \npreferred some form of agreed solution . \n607. Ms Pakhachuk also explained that a s a result of the Bank’s concerns that a significant \nportion of the Bank’s employees remained loyal to the Individual Defendants,  Hogan \nLovells was instructed to develop the claims without the Bank’s involvement  and \nwithout providing regular updates to the Bank’ s staff.  Instead , it was agreed that, at the \nend of that process, when the claims were almost prepared, Hogan Lovells would report \nto the Supervisory Board in order to obtain  authorisation to begin the proceedings.  \n608. On 2 October 2017, Ms Pakhachuk wr ote to Ms Rozhkova to ask that the NBU provide \nto Hogan Lovells copies of materials and information received by the NBU inspection \nteams . That letter was accompanied by an annex, which described various categories of \ndocument s that had been collected by Kroll on behalf of the NBU.   This led to  Hogan \nLovells receiving and being able to review the documents collected by Kroll during the \ncourse of its instruction  by the NBU.  \n609. It is apparent from Ms Hryn’s evidence that , while these preparations were proceeding,  \nnotices asse rting  event s of default and accelerating the debt were served on all 36 of the \nNew Borrowers .

Ms Hryn said that some were prepared by the \nBank at the same time as preparation for the commencement of these proceedings was \nunderway.   In the event, o nly three claims were actually issued against New Borrowers: \nSantekh Master LLC and Triumf 15 LLC in mid -September 2017 and a claim against \nArnad Group LLC approximately one month  later.  However, a day or two later the \nlegal department was instructed not to file any further claims in relation to New \nBorrowers.  Ms Hryn confirmed that her understanding of the Bank’s position on the \nNew Loans was that they gave rise to valid and sub sisting rights which the Bank was \nentitled to enforce, and sought to enforce, by way of demand notices, which were never \nwithdrawn . \n610. On 15 December 2017 , the Bank lodged the papers for its application for the WFO .  \nThese includ ed a 116-page affidavit  with a very substantial exhibit,  a length y expert \nreport on Ukrainian law , a 58-page skeleton argument , draft Particulars of Claim, and \ndraft s of freezing  orders and orders permitting  service out of the jurisdiction.  The judge \nwas asked to set aside one day for pre -reading and one day for the hearing, which in the \nevent was required .  The WFO was  then granted by Nugee J on 19 December 20 17 and \nthe claim form was issued two days later on 21 December 2017 . \n \nExercise by Mr Kolomoisky of influence and control over the Bank and its affairs  \n611. The star ting point for the extent of Mr Kolomoisky’s control, and to this extent he acted \nin conjunction with Mr Bogolyubov , was their legal right as majority shareholders to \ncontrol the Supervisory Board and their legal right as the majority of the Supervisory \nBoard to control the composition and conduct of the Management Board.  I have already \nexplained the se legal rights and how they worked in practice earlier in this judgment.  \nThis section of my judgment seeks to bring a little more colour to what seems to have \nhappened on the ground.  It supports the Bank’s case that it is incredible to suggest that \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n153 \n the Misappropriation could have been planned or implemented without their approval \nand consent . \n612. It was an essential part of the Bank’s case that the relationship, which Mr Kolomoisky \nhad with individuals for whose appointment to management positions within the Bank \nhe and Mr Bogolyubov were responsible, gave him effective control over the Bank’s \nbusiness which was exercised in conjunction with Mr Bogolyubov.  Furthermore, it is \nsaid that the nature of the relationship he had with a number of the individuals who \nplayed a direct and documented role in the Misappropriation made it extremely unlikely \nboth that Mr Kolomoisky did not know what was going on and had not given specific \ninstructions for the steps forming the constituent parts of the Misappropriation to be \ncarried into effect.  That this was the case is said to have been reinforced by the fact \nthat a number of the individuals concerned left the Bank at the time of nationalisation, \nbut continued to be in close contact with the Individual Defendants thereafter (as I \nexplained in the context of my findings in relation to the available witnesses who w ere \nnot but could have been called to give evidence by the Individual Defendants).  \n613.

That this was the case is said to have been reinforced by the fact \nthat a number of the individuals concerned left the Bank at the time of nationalisation, \nbut continued to be in close contact with the Individual Defendants thereafter (as I \nexplained in the context of my findings in relation to the available witnesses who w ere \nnot but could have been called to give evidence by the Individual Defendants).  \n613. The first of these individuals is Mr Dubilet, the chair man of the Management Board \nand member of the ECC who participated in the making of each of the Relevant Loans.  \nHe was therefore closely involved in the events and steps which formed part of the \nMisappropriation.  \n614. There is strikingly little in the way of direct documentary evidence of the contact \nbetween Mr Dubilet and Mr Kolomoisky pre -nationalisation, which is surprising, \nbecause he was chairman of the Management Board of one of Mr Kolomoisky’s \nsignificant assets and Mr Kolomoisky was a man who was always concerned to have a \ncomplete grasp of the detail of his major investments.  In part this is as a result of Mr \nKolomoisky’s practice of not communicating by e -mail.  But it is also clear to me that \nthe absence of a ny documentation is no indication of the extent of the communications \nwhich they in fact had and which were likely either to have been in an unrecorded form \nor, if recorded, to have since been lost or destroyed.  Indeed, in light of the efforts made \nby the  Bank during the course of preparing this case for trial to obtain full disclosure \nfrom Mr Kolomoisky on the nature of his relationship with Mr Dubilet, the total absence \nof any documentation makes it probable that such as existed has since been destroyed.  \n615. The absence of any documentary records of their communications with each other is in \nsharp contrast with what occurred post -nationalisation, which I have summarised in the \nparts of this judgment in which I discussed the availability to the Individual Defen dants \nof witnesses, who were likely to have been sympathetic to their case but were not called \nat the trial.   It is of course possible that the way in which Mr Dubilet was treated and \ncommunicated with by Mr Kolomoisky post -nationalisation, was not reflec tive of the \nway in which they had communicated pre -nationalisation; the position was different \nbecause it is likely that post -nationalisation the communication would have been more \nfocused on the consequences of what had occurred, while pre -nationalisation  it would \nhave been about the management of the Bank and its business.   However, it seems to \nme that, if what had occurred at the time of the Misappropriation had come as a surprise \nto Mr Kolomoisky, there would have been some contemporaneous indication t hat he \nheld Mr Dubilet responsible for the difficulties which this was or might be causing the \nBank, with the potential for an adverse impact on the value of his investment.  There is \nno such indication.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n154 \n 616. These considerations support a conclusion that it is inherently improbable that there \nwere any material aspects of the strategy of how the Bank’s business was conducted \npre-nationalisation which were neither procured nor authorised by Mr Kolomoisky at \nthe time.  That does not mean to say that the implementation of any aspects of the \nBank’s business strategy was specifically authorised by him transaction by transaction.  \nBut having regard to the extent of his legal rights qua shareholder and member of the \nSupervisory Board, the nature of his relationship with Mr Dubilet, and his own \ncharacter, I am satisfied that it is probable that Mr Kolomoisky’s influence on all \nmaterial strategic decisions as to the conduct of the Bank’s affairs was pervasive.  \n617.

The second individual who was said by the Bank to have acted in accordance with the \ninstructions of Mr Kolomoisky was Mr Novikov. As I have already explained, the \nrelevance of this relationship to the claims made in these proceedings is that Mr \nNovikov was  involved in the approval of 127 of the Relevant Loans, was head of the \nBank’s Investment Business and was in charge of Primecap.  He too was therefore \nclosely involved in the events and steps which formed part of the Misappropriation and \nit is therefore o f central relevance if he would not have carried out his functions in \nrelation to the Bank’s affairs without the tacit or active approval of Mr Kolomoisky.  \n618. His relationship with Mr Kolomoisky was very close.  He had important roles not just \nat the Bank, but also in relation to other of the Individual Defendants’ joint business \nassets.  As he said in his evidence in the Pinchuk Proceedings, given in June 2015:  “I \nalso sit on the supervisory boards of a number of businesses affiliated with either or \nboth of the [Individual] Defendants”.  He also gave a flavour of the true nature of the \nrelationship in the following passage from that evidence:  \n“During my years at PrivatBank I have formed a working and personal relationship \nwith both Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov. I would say that my role \nthroughout the period relevant to these proceedings was that of a subordinate \nrequired to act on the instru ctions of Mr Kolomoisky and/or Mr Bogolyubov; my \nrole was not that of a business partner or equal.”  \nTo some extent, thi s was dealing with a slightly earlier period (up until 2011), but some \nof what was said related to the time his witness statement was made and there is no \nreason to think that the nature of the relationship between Mr Kolomoisky and Mr \nNovikov was any diff erent throughout the period of the Misappropriation.  \n619. However, it  is striking that, in the context of these proceedings, there is an  absence of \nmaterial which evidences the sort of instructions referred to by Mr Novikov in his \nPinchuk Proceedings evidenc e.  W ith the exception of a few uninformative messages \nbetween May 2015 and October 2016, there are no surviving documents which \nevidence the giving or receiving of instructions  during the period of the \nMisappropriation or from then until nationalisation.  In part this is explained by the fact \nthat he received these instructions by phone, by text message (which may have been \ndeleted) or in person, but never by e -mail.  But even so, the paucity of the surviving \nrecords of such matters, is striking when compared to the evidence he gave as to his \nearlier level of c ommunication with Mr Kolomoisky and then again as to the level of \ntheir communication after nationalisation.  It is another reason why there remain real \nand substantial concerns that documentation relevant to the issues in these proceedings \nhas either been  destroyed o r deliberately sup pressed.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n155 \n 620.

It is not credible to think that there was a co nvenient fall -off in the \nlevel of their  communication  during the period most relevant to the issues in these \nproceedings.  I also consider it is clear that he was accustomed to act in accordance with \nMr Kolomoisky’s instructions and then to regularly update both of the Individual \nDefendants on the outcome of what occurred as a result of those instructions (a working \npractice w hich he explained in a different context in his Pinchuk Proceedings evidence).  \nIt is most unlikely that he would have participated in any activity which might be \nregarded as contrary to the Indi vidual Defendants’  interests without at least clearing it \nfirst with them  before doing so.  \n621. Another individual who was at the centre of the events surrounding the \nMisappropriation and who was said by the Bank to have acted in accordance with the \ninstructions of Mr Kolomoisky was Ms Gurieva.  She too participated in the approval \nof almost all of t he Relevant Loans as explained (in her case) in paragraph 222 above.  \n622. The documentary evidence of Ms Gurieva’s personal connection to the Individual \nDefendants is sparse when compared to that of Mr Dubilet and Mr Novikov, but it is \nclear that her relationship with Mr Kolomoisky was sufficiently significant for her to \nhave ha d a direct line of communication with him relating to general business \npayments, which is evidenced pre -nationalisation by a significant number of WhatsApp \nexchanges and they appear to have known each other well.  On the face of it, this \nrelationship was c onsistent with what might be expected as between a bank employee \nresponsible for the treasury function and an important commercial customer, and is \ntherefore of limited relevance to the extent of Mr Kolomoisky’s influence over the \ndecisions made by the Man agement Board.  \n623. However, it does establish that they were very accustomed to regular communication \nwith each other and there is some material which is corroborative of the extent to which \nMr Kolomoisky was authorising payments on behalf of entities from the operation of \nwhich he has sought to distance himself.  However, for current purposes the important \npoint is that the nature of the relationship between them, as further evidenced by what \noccurred after nationalisation (as to which see paragraphs 129ff above), was such that \nit seems to me improbable that she would not have participated in anything of \nsignificance in relation to the Bank’s affairs if she had thought it was not in the interest \nof Mr Kolomoisky for her to do so, or that it was not in acc ordance with his approval.  \nThe evidence indicates, and I so find, that she would not have played the role that she \ndid in the events surrounding the making of the Relevant Loans without the specific or \ngeneral approval and authority of Mr Kolomoisky . \n624. Mr Kolomoisky is also said to have exercised that control through instilling a culture \nof extreme deference and fear within the Bank, which was said to have been reinforced \nby his reputation as an aggressive businessman and the employees’ knowledge and \nbelief that they would lose their jobs if they did not do as they were told.  It was through \nthese sometime s insidious means that the Bank alleges that Mr Kolomoisky, together \nwith Mr Bogolyubov, controlled all significant decisions made by the Bank, and in \nparticular those relating to the Misappropriation, the decisions to approve the Relevant \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolo"}

To an extent, the Bank’s case on its internal culture at the time of the Misappropriation \nwas supported by parts of Ms Pogorelaya’s evidence.  She said that the culture within \nthe Bank was such that employees simply did not question (or refuse to comply wi th) \ninstructions given by their superiors.  The way she expressed herself was that she simply \ncarried out her instructions and tried not to think too deeply about it.  She said that she \nwas sure that she would have lost her job if she had refused to perfor m a task she had \nbeen asked to carry out and that she could not afford to take that risk, because it would \nnot have been easy to find an equivalent job elsewhere.   There is no reason to believe \nthat her experience of how to survive in light of the way things were done within the \nBank was anything other than widespread amongst its employees – she said that this \nwas part of the Bank’s culture and her evidence to that effect was not challenged by the \nDefendants.  \n626. The Bank’s case on the culture of deference to instructions from superiors was also \nconsistent with the evidence of Mr Luchaninov and Ms Pakhachuk that there were other \ngroups of employees within BOK, and Ms Gurieva was specifically mentioned, who \nwere acc ustomed to receive instructions from Mr Kolomoisky.  (The position in relation \nto Mr Bogolyubov is less clear -cut and I will revert to it below).  These instructions \nrelated in particular to the affairs of the Bank’s strategic customers, which were \nunderst ood to be companies within the wider business group of both Mr Kolomoisky \nand Mr Bogolyubov.   The Bank also demonstrated from miscellaneous e -mail \nexchanges and Skype chats between employees within BOK that employees jumped \nthe moment anything of interest affect ing the Individual Defendants arose (particularly \nin so far as i t affected what seems to have been called the shareholder programme)  with \nMs Rokoman only half jokingly referring to Mr Kolomoisky as being everywhere.  \n627. Ms Pakhachuk agreed with the Bank’s description of existing employees being loyal to \nthe Individual Defendants as opposed to the new management team introduced on \nnationalisation.  She described in her witness statement how Mr Novikov and Ms \nGurieva simply  left on nationalisation without a proper transfer of their work and that \nthe new management were not certain that they could trust the information given to \nthem by the employees who remained.  She went on to say in a telling passage in her \nevidence:  \n“The Former Owners are extremely well known in Ukraine as powerful and \ninfluential individuals and, from the beginning of my time at the Bank, I can \nremember being struck by the feeling that this influence was continuing amongst \nthe Bank staff even though the Former Owners no longer controlled the Bank. I \nspecifically remember having the impression that the existing Bank staff regarded \nthe nationalisation as a temporary phenomenon, something that would come and \ngo, and that the Former Owners would eventuall y return to their previous positions \nto control the Bank.”  \n628. She made clear in her oral evidence that the loyalty which this evidence described was \nto both Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov.  She also said that while she accepted that \nt"}
{"start": 588000, "text": "e Former Owners no longer controlled the Bank. I \nspecifically remember having the impression that the existing Bank staff regarded \nthe nationalisation as a temporary phenomenon, something that would come and \ngo, and that the Former Owners would eventuall y return to their previous positions \nto control the Bank.”  \n628. She made clear in her oral evidence that the loyalty which this evidence described was \nto both Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov.  She also said that while she accepted that \nthis was an impression, rather than one for which she was able to point to any speci fic \nexhibition of personal loyalty, her impression was part of a consistent picture which \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n157 \n comes through in a number of small respects, but which serves to build a more \ncompelling whole.  It is right to say that the evidence is consistent with the loyalty being \nmore focused on Mr Kolomoisky than it was on Mr Bogolyubov (indeed there was \nsome con temporaneous material which confirmed that to be the case), but I am satisfied \nthat the way in which it came across to the Bank’s new management was that it was \napplicable to both of them.  \n629. In broad terms I accept the thrust of Ms Pakhachuk’s evidence as to the culture within \nthe Bank.  Furthermore, and despite the views I have expressed about the way Ms \nLozytska gave her evidence, I agree with her statements to the effect that it took the \nform of an unwillingness to ask questions about the relationships between the Bank’s \ncustomers and the Individual Defendants unless the material with which they were \npresented raised on its face  clear suspicions that was the case.   \n630. The Bank submitted that the culture of fear was reinforced by the Individual \nDefendants’ reputation as aggressive businessmen, and the knowledge that they would \nlose their jobs if they did not do what they were told.  I accept that the culture was \nintimida tory to some at least of the Bank’s employees, but while there was evidence, \nwhich I accept, that Ms Rozhkova was subjected by Mr Kolomoisky to threats which \nimplied physical violence (I have already referred to these) there is no direct evidence \nthat Mr K olomoisky behaved in the same or a similar manner to any of the Bank’s \nemployees.  I do not, however, think that the Bank’s submission that the culture was one \nof “extreme” deference, even fear within the Bank is made out.  The evidence does not \ngo that far, but it does support a clear finding that Mr Kolomoisky was a domin eering  \nbusinessman, who instilled loyalty in those who were prepared to do his bidding, but \nwho had no hesitation in getting what he wanted by intimidating others.  This had a \ndirect impac t on the culture within the Bank which meant that instructions which did or \nwere thought to emanate from either or both of the Individual Defendants were \ncomplied with in an unquestioning and uncritical manner.  This was more particularly \nthe case where th e instructions related to Bank customers, which were or were \nsuspected to be related in some way to the Individual Defendants as the Bank’s \nshareholders.  \n631. In a more technical context concerned with related parties, there is a revealing e -mail \nexchange in June 2015 relating to the issue of regulatory control, which is illustrative \nof the true position.  Mr Medvedev, Mr Luchaninov, Mr Vetluzhskikh and Mikhail \nRomanov (general counsel in the Bank’s compliance department both before and after \nnationalisation) were all party to the exchange.  Mr Luchaninov and Mr Medvedev both \nexpressed the view in this exchange that Mr Kolomoisky and Mr B ogolyubov were not \nthe Ba nk’s controllers but were major shareholders and that the Bank’s auditors and the \nNBU should be informed as much.

However, Mr Vetluzhskikh  was more doubtful – as \nhe said: “this position is not self -evident - I, for example, although I know what the \ndefinition of a controller is, still don’t understand why it’s that way” and asked Mr \nRomanov to comment.  \n632. Mr Romanov’s response was illuminating.  He said:  \n“We’re not able to confidently confirm that Mr BGB and Mr KIB are not \ncontrollers  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n158 \n a controller is a physical person or legal entity not controlled by other physical \npersons, which is able to exercise decisive influence over the management and \nbusiness of a legal entity by direct and/or indirect sole or joint ownership in that \nlegal entity of 50 or greater percent ownership interest and/or votes therein, or \nwhich is able to, independent of any formal ownership, to effectively exercise s such \ninfluence under agreement or in any other manner.  \ni.e. control does not necessarily always require “50%.” No one will be able to  deny \nthat Misters  BGB and KIV do not have a material influence over the management \nof the bank.  \nin addition, the controller - under the Commercial Code, the Law on Money \nLaundering and the Law on Registration - is the ultimate beneficial owner \n(controller). Misters BGB and KIV are listed as the ultimate beneficiaries \n(controllers) of the Bank on the EDRPOU website. ” \n633. Mr Medvedev’s response was as follows:  \n“Dear Colleagues,  \nNo need to complicate matters. NBU should receive direct and accurate answers \nthat can only be contested when resorting to proposals and guesses, rather than \nshowing documents. By the way, when the Bank Group structure was formed, the \nBank was specified as  the controller, not IVK and GBB. And we know why:)  \nFormally: directly and indirectly each of them owns less than 50% of the Bank’s \ncapital; they do not have an agreement on joint share management; on the \nSupervisory Board they have 1/5 votes (they did have 1/3 votes).  \nThey do not have control!  It is impossible to prove this any further!”  \n634. This was obviously a technical debate about the meaning of control from an audit and \nregulatory perspective, but it is apparent that the Bank’s compliance department had a \nvery clear understanding that both of the Individual Defendants exercised a material  \ninfluence over the management of the Bank amounting to de facto  control and that \nnobody could deny it.  The reason for this was that, notwithstanding the fact that neither \nof them alone held 50% or more of the Bank’s share capital, they were both able to \nexercise decisive influence over the management and business of the Bank.  It was \nequally clear that a deliberate decision had been made to structure the Bank in a manner \nwhich sought to avoid technical control from arising, which had little if anything to  do \nwith the position on the ground.  \n635. Mr Kolomoisky made little effort in his closing submissions to counter the wealth of \nevidence which showed that he was a dominant and controlling presence in the affairs \nof the Bank, and many of his submissions were presented on the basis that this was the  \nright way to characterise his conduct.  It is clear to me that he was both a controller \nthrough his status as a major shareholder and member of the Supervisory Board and \nalso exercised a level of influence which amounted to  de facto  control  over the Bank’ s \naffairs and the manner in which it conducted its business , exercised in many respects in \nconsultation  and with the approval of  Mr Bogolyubov .

In particular I think \nthat it is inconceivable that the structure of the loan recycling scheme and the detail of \nhow it would operate could have been  designed or put in place without his express \ninformed consent.  \n \nExercise by Mr  Bogolyubov of influence and control over the Bank and its affairs  \n636. The nature and extent of  Mr Bogolyubov ’s interest and control is not so easy to discern,  \nand it was a central part of his defence that his position was very different to that of Mr \nKolomoisky by the time the Misappropriation took place.  As he did not attend to give \nevidence to support this case, the closing submissions made on his behalf con centrated \non the contention that the Bank had not established a credible prima facie  case that Mr \nBogolyubov was involved in any wrongdoing and that the documentary rec ord in fact \nled to an inference that he was not involved in what was called the supposed Scheme.  \nThe credibility of his case on this issue is informed by the evidence on the extent to \nwhich he had ceased to have any active management role in the Bank.  \n637. In ma king that assessment it is important to keep in mind that Mr Bogolyubov was the \nholder of c.45% of the shares in the Bank, that he was chair man of the Supervisory \nBoard  which appointed the Management Board, that he admitted an interest in 19 of the \nBorrowers  and that he accepts that nominees from PBC who held his assets on oral \nagreements or who subsequently became employees  of Sunaltezza are included \namongst the nominee UBO s of the Borrowers  and other Relevant Entities . \n638. Mr Bogolyubov’s argument on this aspect of the case was based not just on his \ncontention (albeit not evidence d by him p erson ally) that he did not in fact give any \ninstructions to the Bank’s managers and was not in fact involved in any part of its day \nto day management.  It also extended to the true nature of his interest in the shares he \nheld in the Bank, because he said that , since July 2014, he had been exercising the \nvoting rights attached to his shares in the Bank (and his duties as chairman of the \nSupe rvisory Board ) at the sole direction or instruction of Mr Kolomoisky . \n639. While it is not disputed by the Bank that the role played by Mr Bogolyubov was \ndifferent from the role played by Mr Kolomoisky, and that in a number of respects his \ninvolvement was less immediate to what occurred, the Bank contends that there is no \nevidenc e to support the submissions made on behalf of Mr Bogolyubov that he \nsomehow stepped away from the Bank during the Misappropriation.  There are a \nnumber of aspects to this part of Mr Bogolyubov’s case which require careful \nexamination.  \n640. The first is the assertion that, on Mr Bogolyubov’s move to London in 2009, he \ndeveloped a number of other interests, in particular Consmin, a large manganese ore \nproducer.  Although his absence from the witness box meant that it was not possible to \nexplor e with him the precise extent of his other interests in this period, there is some \ndocumentation which supports that this was one of a number of other substantial \nbusinesses with which he was involved in some capacity or another.

I accept it is quite \nlikely that, after 2009, he devoted less time to the affairs of the Bank, but I do not agree \nthat the very limited material which he has chosen to disclose in relation to his other \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n160 \n interests supports a submission that, notwithstanding his shareholding and membership \nof the Supervisory Board, his approach was “hands -off”. \n641. I also accept that, although it was not possible to test the precise extent of his role, or \nwhat “hands -off” actually means in this instance, there is no obvious reason why he \nwould have participated in the day -to-day activities of the Bank.  Nonetheless, the \nsurrounding circumstances are such that it is not possible to accept without more \ncorroboration that he was inactive to the extent described in his closing submissions.  \nThis is not just because he was a major shareholder of the Bank with a significant  \nfinancial interest in the way it conducted its business.  It was not just an investment for \nhim; he was also a member of the Supervisory Board, and more than that its chairman, \na position which he did not relinquish until April 2015.  On the face of thing s, it is \ninherently unlikely that, having that shareholder interest and those Supervisory Board \npositions, he would have minimised his participation in the Bank’s affairs to no more \nthan attendance at the statutory meetings.  As with Mr Kolomoisky, part of  the reason \nfor this inherent unlikelihood is the nature of his relationship with Mr Dubilet, Mr \nNovikov and Ms Gurieva, all three of whom were significant members of the \nManagement Board and intimately involved in the steps relied on by the Bank as part \nof the Misappropriation.  \n642. The documentary material discloses that, like Mr Kolomois ky, Mr Bogolyubov had a \nlong-standing pre -nationalisation relationship with Mr Dubilet.  They were in regular \ncommunication on a whole range of such matters (e.g., the data  showed  108 mobile  \nphone conversations between them over the period 3 February 2014 to 1 June 2014)  as \nit is reasonable to expe ct would be discussed between the chairman of a bank’s \nsupervisory board and the chairman of its management board.  To that extent, there is \nnothing particu larly surprising about the correspondence, although it serves to \nemphasise that he was far more than just an investor.   My attention was drawn to a \nwhole range of different matters on which Mr Bogolyubov was consulted by Mr Dubilet \nand for which his authority was sought .  Many of them related to his own assets  (e.g.,  \nauthorisation of credit limit s for managers of his other businesses) , but that of itself \nshows a focus on the details where banking decisions related to his own person al \nposition .  He also kept a close eye on matters con nected to the issue of related parties  \nand I was shown one example (there seem ed to be many more) of his inv olvement in \nagreeing a loan repayment schedule , this one  for a lo an issued by PrivatBank Latvia to \nRG-Trans LLC . \n643. The Bank produced a very detailed 27 page schedule to its closing submissions referring \nto numerous instances  from the correspondence of Mr Bogolyubov’s  documented \ninvolvement with the Bank and its former employees.

The Bank produced a very detailed 27 page schedule to its closing submissions referring \nto numerous instances  from the correspondence of Mr Bogolyubov’s  documented \ninvolvement with the Bank and its former employees.  It cover s the period January 2013 \nto April 2021 and lists many  examples not just of Supervisory Board meetings and \ninstances of Mr Bogolyubov’s involvement as a shareholder of the Bank, but also his \ninteractions with the NBU and interactions with others as to the Bank's business.  Some , \nbut by no means all , of these interaction s were said in Mr Bogolyubov’s submission s \nnot to have the significance attributed to them by the Bank, and in several instances that \nis the case.  But m uch of th e interaction c overs the period after  Mr Bogolyubov  said \nthat he had reached an oral agreement with Mr Kolomoisky to step back from his role \nin the Bank .  This is a point which I shall deal with shortly , but I accept that the focus \nin this period is on his role as a member of the Supervisory Board and in communicating  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n161 \n with the NBU , with which he continued to be deeply and intimately involved ; there is \nless miscellaneous communication with Mr Dubilet and others . \n644. I do not agree with the submission made on behalf of Mr Bogolyubov that these \ncommunications can all be characterised as unrelated to the ‘Scheme’ or that they were \n‘innocuous’.  In my view, it is significant that they included matters such as the Bank’s \ncapital needs relating to a proposal for the issue of subordinated debt, the grant of \nstabilisation loans, related party letters, the Restructuring Plan and the Asset Transfers \nall of which were related to the value of the Bank’s loan book and in the case o f the \nAsset Transfers  to steps taken by the Individual Defendants in response to the \nMisappropriation.  It is also significant that the communications extended, pre -\nnationalisation, to matters relating to Mr Bogolyubov’s other business interests, \nincluding setting the limits f or which the Bank should lend to his own companies.  In \nthat regard, the relationship between them extended materially beyond that to be \nexpected between a bank’s chairman and one of its controlling shareholders.  \n645. At the time of the Misappropriation, there is only one short period (between February \nand May 2014) in which there is an apparently complete record of telephone \ncommunication between Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Dubilet.  I have reached the \nconclusion that there i s no reason to think that this level of regular communication \nbetween the two men was unusual.  The more likely explanation for the absence of any \ndirect evidence of such communications in other periods is not that they did not occur, \nbut that the records of them have not survived.  The level of communication for that \nsingle four -month period, combined with the fact that there is no evidence that Mr \nBogolyubov was in any manner surprised when the making of the Relevant Loans and \nthe events surrounding the Misappropriation were reported by the press (a point which \nalso applies to Mr Ko lomoisky and to which I will return), is evidence that, if Mr \nDubilet had given evidence at the trial, it is unlikely to have supported Mr \nBogolyubov’s case that he did not know  about or give approval to the Relevant Loans.  \n646. Mr Dubilet was not the only individual involved in the Misappropriation with whom \nMr Bogolyubov was in regular contact pre -nationalisation and who is said to have acted \nin accordance with his instructions in relation to the affairs of the Bank.  Thus, the \nsurviving direct evidence of Mr Bogolyubov’s pre -nationalisation contact with Mr \nNovikov is more pervasive than that of Mr Kolomoisky and included e -mail.

In the \nperiod after 2011, these communications covered a wide range of matters including \npersonal in vestment opportunities, social events, the Bank’s audit and treatment of \nrelated parties, asset financing and loan proposals (from the Bank and other financiers \nsuch as Sberbank) in relation to Mr Bogolyubov’s assets including Hotel Split , which \nhad been included in Annex B to the Restructuring Plan , correspondence about the \noperation of the banking market in Cyprus, and correspondence about Mr Pinchuk and \nthe Pinchuk Proceedings.  \n647. There was also correspondence relating to the Deeds of Waiver and Indemnity  said to \nhave been executed in May and June 2015, which I referred to  at the beginning of this \njudgment and to which I revert below.  There is also some evidence of pre -\nnationalisation WhatsApp bank payment -related communication between Mr Novikov \nand Mr Bogolyubov’s personal assistant, Mr Anischenko.  He moved to Geneva with \nMr Bogolyubov  in 2017  and has continued to work for Mr Bogolyubov  since the \ncommencement of these proceedings .  But Mr Bogolyubov’s own pre -2017 WhatsApp \nmessages with Mr Novikov have been deleted.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n162 \n 648. Although the communications between Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Novikov were regular \nand covered a wide range of topics, the number of e -mails overall was not extensive.  \nThe same cannot be said about phone communication.  Although very few telephone \nlogs were di sclosed, it is striking that, between February and May 2014 (which was the \nsame relatively short period in which telephone records have been disclosed relating to \nMr Bogolyubov’s contact with Mr Dubilet), Mr Bogolyubov also communicated on an \nalmost daily basis with Mr Novikov.  In the light of the practice adopted by Mr \nBogolyubov of destroying documentation which would have been relevant to these \nproceedings, I consider it is very likely that the disclosed material relating to his \nrelationship with Mr Nov ikov does not give anything other than a wholly incomplete \npicture of what in fact occurred.  \n649. By contrast t here is no direct evidence of Mr Bogolyubov’s pre -nationalisation contact \nwith Ms Gurieva, such as to establish that he gave specific instructions to her as to how \nshe should carry out her duties.  Furthermore, Ms Montgomery’s cross -examination of \nMr Lucha ninov established that his assumption that, because Ms Gurieva managed \nBOK and because BOK was a specialised unit for servicing strategic Bank clients \namongst whom were the Individual Defendants and their companies, she would have \nbeen taking instructions directly from Mr Bogolyubov, was not based on any direct \nevidence.  Nonetheless it is clear that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, and \nbecause most of the most valuable companies accepted by the Individual Defendants in \ntheir asset disclosure lists as their jointly held assets were also recorded as clients of \nBOK, it is highly likely that Mr Bogolyubov had more regular contact with Ms Gurieva \nthan the disclosed documentation shows.  \n650. It was also said on behalf of Mr Bogolyubov that it is no t part of the Bank’s case that \nany acts comprising the loan recycling scheme were authorised by the Supervisory \nBoard.

That is right so far as it goes but, as Mr Bogolyubov accepts, one of the functions \nit was responsible for was lending policy and it play ed a significant role in the Asset \nTransfers when he was still a member.  I do not accept that the evidence demonstrates \nthat Mr Bogolyubov’s role as member and chairman of the Supervisory Board can \nproperly be characterised as no more than limited and for mal.  It simply shows that its \nfunctions did not include day to day management, although even that does not give a \ncomplete picture of the true position, because the Charter required all loans exceeding \nUS$2 million and all related party lending exceeding US$500,000 to be authorised by \nthe Supervisory Board.  \n651. However, there is no documentation which shows that these formal lending \nrequirements were ever complied with and it seems highly likely that the contrary was \nthe case, in any event by any form of formal board approval.  There is credible evidence \nthat Mr Bogolyubov had not been signing off on loans at all since 2010 and that, \nnotwithstanding the provisions of the Charter, everything had been be en signed by Mr \nDubilet.  This appears to have been news to Mr Luchaninov who was head of \ncompliance, all of which  demonstrates that the Bank’s internal controls were not \nfunctioning properly.   Indeed the NBU addressed the position in two of its audit reports \n(sent to Mr Bogolyubov on 15 August 2014 and 27 March 2015 ), which criticised the \ncommunication between the Supervisory Board and the Management Board.  One of  \nthese  report s also made particular reference to a failure to obtain Supervisory Board \napproval for loans to related parties.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n163 \n 652. It was said on behalf of Mr Bogolyubov that this illustrated not just that he was not \ninvolved in assessing any of the relevant risks, let alone in approving or being involved \nin the provision of the circular loans, but also that he was not involved in app rovals \nwhich the law required to be given by the Supervisory Board of which he was chairman.  \nThis was said to be an example of why it was not possible to infer from the functions \nwhich the Supervisory Board should have fulfilled that  his membership of the  \nSupervisory Board  meant that he must have been aware of and approved related party \nlending.    \n653. Mr Bogolyubov is correct to say that  the NBU  was very critical of the ineffectiveness \nof the interaction between the Supervisory Board and the Bank’s management.  Indeed \nthe Bank’s description of the criticisms of the deficiencies highlighted in that regard as \n‘excoriating’ is fully justified.   The y extended to (a) failures to conduct regular \nassessments of the effectiveness of the Management Board’s actions on managing the \nBanks operations, (b) failures to submit to the Supervisory Board timely , meaningfu l, \naccurate and complete reports on the management of significant risks and the methods \nof control over these risks and (c) failures to ensure that joint written decisions of the \nManagement Board and the Supervisory Board were made when granting loans and \nguarantees to members of the Bank’s management where the loan exceeded UAH \n120,000.  \n654. The effect of Mr Bogolyubov’s submission was that this failure to comply with the \nformalities of what should have occurred was inconsistent with the Supervisory Board \nhaving knowledge of the extent of related party lending and the Relevant Loans.

Either \nthe Supervisory Board did not know what was going on and cannot be criticised for it \nor, at most, the members were simply negligent in their supervision of management \nrather than knowing participants in management dishonesty.  \n655. Quite apart from the fact that Mr Bogolyubov chose not to attend court to enable the \nBank to test his case on this point in cross -examination, I do not think that carelessness \nis the right inference to draw.  The reason for this is that I agree with the Bank’s \nsubmission that a rather more striking aspect of what occurred is the way that Mr \nBogolyubov responded or did not respond to the NBU report of which he (like Mr \nDubilet) w as a named addressee.  Thus, there is no evidence that the Supervisory Board \nwas surprised by what had been disclosed by the NBU or took any action to enforce the \nobligations of the Management Board to introduce mechanisms to enforce the \nrequirements of the NBU’s regulations (echoed in what was at the relevant time clause \n9.3.3.(45) o f the Charter) on related party lending.   This is all the more striking in \ncircumstances in which he and Mr Kolomoisky were the main individuals in respect of \nwhom the related party issue arose.  This is a point which is further affected by my \nfindings in relation to the ownership and control of the Relevant Entities.  \n656. I think that the Bank is correct to submit that Mr Bogolyubov’s reaction to this highly \ncritical report was the opposite of what a person in his position with no prior knowledge \nof these deficiencies would have done.  Neither he nor Mr Kolomoisky insisted on an \ninvestigation, nor did either of them take any steps to institute disciplinary action or \nproceedings against the members of the Management Board, whom he now says were \nresponsible for what occurred.  Indeed, in their capacity as members of the Superv isory \nBoard, they voted in favour of the Management Board’s reappointment and, as I shall \nexplain later in this judgment, they both agreed to the charging of assets in which they \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n164 \n had an interest as security for stabilisation loans advanced by the NBU and for further \ncontributions to the Bank’s capital.  \n657. At the very least , this is consistent with the fact that the reason that Mr Bogolyubov as \nits chairman did not do so was because he already knew exactly what approach the \nBank’s management was taking to the issue of related party lending and had given his \napproval to what was being done.   For reason s which will become apparent, the absence \nof any manifestation of surprise by the members of the Supervisory Board (including \nmost particularly the Individual Defendants) is not just consistent with their prior \nknowledge of widespread improper related party lending, it also reflects and \ncorroborates the other circumstantial evidence  that they knew and approved  of lending \nin the form of the loan recycling scheme of which the Relevant Loans formed part and \nalso that it was  being extended to related parties for the ir own ultimate benefit .  On that \nlast point, t he obvious question which arise s, to which there has been no answer given \nduring the course of the trial,  is why he did not make an enormous fuss about what had \nbeen discovered if it had not all been done for the ultimate benefit of him and Mr \nKolomoisky and on  their instructions.  \n658. This conclusion is corroborated by the attitude of the shareholders at their meeting held \non 27 April 2015, which was held after the NBU’s March report had been provided to \nMr Bogolyubov  one month earlier .  It was recorded that:  \n“T"}

This conclusion is corroborated by the attitude of the shareholders at their meeting held \non 27 April 2015, which was held after the NBU’s March report had been provided to \nMr Bogolyubov  one month earlier .  It was recorded that:  \n“The work of [the] Management Board in 2014 shall be acknowledged as \nsatisfactory and in accordance with the purpose and direction of the Company’s \nactivities”  \nand \n“Due to the established actions of the Supervisory Board and the Management \nBoard, the Bank fulfils its obligations in time to the budget, shareholders, state and \nsupervisory authorities…”  \n659. There was a similar response to the NBU’s 2016 inspection report  which referred to \nrelated party transactions consuming more than 70% of the Bank's assets and over 800% \nof its regulatory capital , and which went on to make similar criticisms of the Bank’s \ninternal controls and reporting procedures to those which had been criticised in the \nNBU’s  report  for 2014 .  The Supervisory Board simply told the Management Board to \nimplement the NBU 's recommendations, but again there is no evidence of any  surprise  \nat the  form the NBU report  had taken .  Again, at the shareholders ’ meeting held on 26 \nAugust 2016, the performance of the Management Board was recognised as \nsatisfactory , with the following recorded in the minutes, and no indication that an \ninvestigation was required into the reasons behind the NBU’s conclusions:  \n“The entire team of the Bank, according to the Supervisory Board, deserves high \nappraisal and the Bank’s Management Board financial and operating performance \nreport deserves approval.”  \n660. One of the points made on his behalf in closing was that there was no evidence to \nsupport an inference that Mr Bogolyubov had any control over Mr Kolomoisky.  I \naccept that submission, not least because I also accept that the evidence of Mr \nKolomoisky’s ow n strong and domineering character was pervasive and the same \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n165 \n cannot be said about the evidence relating to the way that Mr Bogolyubov behaved.  It \npoints to him being a less central figure in the affairs of the Bank than Mr Kolomoisky.  \nHowever, it remained the case that the Bank was properly to be regarded as one o f the \nIndividual Defendants’ jointly owned assets (of which there had been many over the \nyears) and there is every indication from the way in which shareholder and Supervisory \nBoard decisions were made that, throughout the period up to nationalisation, the y \nworked in conjunction with each other in relation to its affairs.  \n661. The Bank sought to bolster its case on the extent of Mr Bogolyubov’s  control ling \ninfluence  by adducing evidence from  Mr Luchaninov.  He explained that he made \nassumptions that Ms Gurieva and Mr Novikov would have taken instructions directly \nfrom both Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov. In both instances there was some \njustification for the assumptions he made based on the w ay in which BOK and the \nBank’s compliance department (of which he was head) operated.  Indeed the fact that \nMr Luchaninov’s assumption was genuinely made was not dispu ted by the Defendants.  \n662. However, the weight of this evidence is affected by Mr Luchaninov’s acceptance that \nhe had no personal knowledge of how Mr Bogolyubov in fact acted because he had \nnever witnessed any instructions being given by him.  His lack of any detailed \nunderstanding of Mr Bogolyubov’s real role is also apparent from the fact that he did \nnot know that Mr Bogolyubov had moved to London in 20 09.

Furthermore, his \nevidence in relation to the instructions he assumed were given by Mr Bogolyubov to \nMr Novikov related to a di sclosure exercise carried out by Freshfields in relation to the \nPinchuk Proceedings in which Freshfields acted for Mr Kolomoisky, but not Mr \nBogolyubov.  As Mr Luchaninov himself accepted, this went some way to undermining \nhis assumption that Mr Novikov wa s acting for both of the Individual Defendants rather \nthan just Mr Kolomoisky.  \n663. The basis for Mr Luchaninov’s assumptions was also affected by his agreement that he \nhad never met Mr Bogolyubov or seen him at the Bank’s premises.  The fact that he \nwas rarely present, anyway in Mr Luchaninov’s department, was confirmed by his oral \nevide nce that “some colleagues have seen Mr Bogolyubov personally, but that was long \nago”, by which he meant times which may have been more than 10 years prior to the \ntime with which these proceedings are concerned.  I accept that all of this significantly \naffects the weight which it is appropriate to attribute to this aspect of Mr Luchaninov’s \nevidence.  \n664. The Bank also adduced evidence from Ms Lozytska that she assumed that Mr Dubilet, \nMs Gurieva, Mr Novikov, Mr Yatsenko and Ms Chmona would have had close \nrelationships with both of the Individual Defendants.  As I have already explained, she \nwas challenged about this and accepted that she had no direct knowledge of their \ninterpersonal relationships and based her assumption on the structure of the Bank’s \nmanagement committees and the Supervisory Board.  Taken alone, what Ms Lozytska \nhad to say was of limited evidential value because it added very little to the undisputed \nfact that Mr Bogolyubov had roles pursuant to which he would have received reports \nfrom Mr Dubilet who would himself have received reports from the heads of the various \nbusiness divisions, inc luded BOK.  \n665. Nonetheless, Ms Lozytska, who was employed by the Bank at the time, stood by her \nbelief that the Individual Defendants had a close relationship with the heads of the \nBank’s various business divisions and, in the absence of any evidence from Mr \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n166 \n Bogolyubov to explain that he did not, I think that this assumption cannot be discounted \naltogether.  It is part of the overall picture, which gives some support to an inference \nthat Mr Bogolyubov was very much more than just an investor with a wholly non -\ninterventionist role as chairman of the Supervisory Board.  \n666. It follows that, while I a gree that there is little by way of particularisation of the basis \nfor the assumptions which were made by Mr Luchaninov and Ms Lozytska, I do not \nthink that they can be dismissed out of hand.  I also consider that they were consistent \nwith the evidence of Ms P ogorelaya and Ms Pakhachuk, the latter of whom had said in \nan interview that Mr Kolomoisky was believed by 70% of the Bank’s employees to \nhave been “a god, a giant who created something that no one could create”, but she \nrejec ted a suggestion made in her cross -examination by Ms Montgomery that this \nsupported the proposition that members of the Bank’s staff were only loyal to Mr \nKolomoisky. She said that, although she had no personal acquaintance of Mr \nBogolyubov and Mr Kolomois ky, they were in her view “both equally responsible \npersons”.

It is clear to me that, in general terms, this description both of Mr Kolomoisky \nand Mr Bogolyubov reflected a widely held view by the Bank’s employees of the role \nwithin the Bank which they bo th fulfilled.   \n667. This evidence has to be treated with some caution, but I have no real doubt that it all \nreflected a common understanding within the Bank.  As Mr Luchaninov explained, he \ncame to the conclusion that Ms Gurieva was taking instructions from Mr Bogolyubov \nhaving observed the way in which BOK, as the specialised unit  for servicing the Bank’s \nstrategic clients , was in possession of and used information relating to the beneficial \nowners of those strategic customers.  Although the evidence was neither specific nor \nvery clear  (and evidence about the basis of the assumptions he made in relation to \ninstructions given by Mr Bogolyubov to Mr Novikov is similarly unclear), I think that \nthe point he was trying to express was that the work which BOK was doing was on the \nbasis that bot h Ms Gurieva and Mr Novikov were in a general sense known to have \nbeen in communication with Mr Bogolyubov, even though he did not observe that \ncontact himself.  \n668. They are also consistent with the status which Mr Bogolyubov had within the Bank as \nshareholder and chairman of the Supervisory Board and the nature of the long -term \nrelationship he had with Mr Kolomoisky whose influence on the Bank’s affairs \ngenerally, an d lending practices in particular, was more immediately dominant  and \npervasive  than that of Mr Bogolyubov.  \n \nThe Deeds of Waiver and Indemnity  \n669. Initially, Mr Bogolyubov sought to bolster what he said were the limitations in his role \nat the Bank by relying on the following paragraph in his Defence:  \n“On 2 March 2014, Mr Kolomoisky was appointed governor of the Dnipropetrovsk \nregion. Mr Bogolyubov was concerned about the potential impact upon the Bank \nof Mr Kolomoisky holding such a high -profile political position at a time when \nRussia was at war with Ukraine. In June 2014, Mr Bogolyubov decided that he \nwished to divest himself of his shareholding in the Bank. It became apparent that \nMr Bogolyubov would not be able to sell his shares in the Bank at that stage but, \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n167 \n until he could do so, he decided to reduce his limited role on the Supervisory Board. \nHe subsequently resigned.”  \n670. Subsequently, in his Re -Re-Amended Defence served several years after the \ncommencement of the proceedings, Mr Bogolyubov added the following allegation, \nwhich sought to rely for the first time on the existence of an oral agreement, later \nconfirmed by the execution of certain deeds  of waiver and indemnity:  \n“On or around 12 May 2015, Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Kolomoisky executed a deed \nof waiver and indemnity (the Deed of Waiver) recording an oral agreement that \nhad been made between them on or around 1 July 2014 concerning Mr \nBogolyubov’s desire to divest his sha res in the Bank. The Deed of Waiver recorded \nthat (and it was the case that) since 1 July 2014, Mr Bogolyubov had been \nexercising the voting rights attached to his shares in the Bank and his duties as \nchairman of the Supervisory Board at the sole direction  of Mr Kolomoisky. In May \nand June 2015, Mr Bogolyubov entered into similar agreements with the Bank’s \nthen other significant shareholders (Triantal Investments Limited, Timur Novikov \nand Alexander Dubilet).”  \n671.

I shall call the deed dated 12 May 2015 the “Initial Deed of Waiver”.  Mr Kolomoisky’s \nsignature was witnessed by Mr Novikov and Mr Bogolyubov’s signature was executed \nby an English solicitor called Alex Van Der Zwaan, neither of whom were called to \nverify  its authenticity.  It contained a number of recitals.  The first referred to an \nagreement reached on 1 July 2014 between Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov in \nrespect of any liabilities arising from Mr Bogolyubov’s positions as chairman of the \nSupervisory Bo ard or his direct and indirect shareholdings in the Bank.  The second \nwas that, in order to maintain public confidence in the Bank and to maintain the stability \nof the Ukrainian financial system, Mr Bogolyubov would stagger the reduction in his \ndirect and indirect shareholding in the Bank over time until he was no longer a \nshareholder and that he would remain as chairman of the Supervisory Board pending \nthe identification of an appropriate replacement.  The third  was that, despite remaining \na shareholder of  the Bank and being in the position of chairman of the Supervisory \nBoard, Mr Bogolyubov “no longer exercises any management control over PrivatBank \nde facto  even though he continues to do so de jure ”.  It went on to record that, since 1 \nJuly 2014, he had been voting his shares in the Bank and acting as its chairman at the \nsole direction of Mr Kolomoisky.  \n672. The operative parts of the Initial Deed of Waiver then reiterated the recitals in relation \nto how Mr Bogolyubov had been exercising his voting rights, that he no longer \nexercised any management control and that anything done by him since 1 July 2014 \nhad be en done solely as a result of instructions given by Mr Kolomoisky.  By clause 3, \nMr Kolomoisky agreed to procure a waiver from the Bank and all of its shareholders \nrelating to any breaches or potential breaches committed by him as shareholder or \nchairman o f the Bank since 1 July 2014.  By clause 4, Mr Kolomoisky agreed to \nindemnify Mr Bogolyubov against any liability for loss arising out of any claim arising \nin connection with his position as chairman or shareholder of the Bank, including in \nrespect of his own “negligence, gross negligence, fraudulent or otherwise unlawful \nacts”.  \n673. Although they were not all pleaded, Mr Bogolyubov’s opening and closing submissions \nalso referred to four further deeds which he entered into later in May 2015 and in June \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n168 \n 2015.  One of these further deeds of waiver was with Mr Kolomoisky himself; the other \nthree were with three of the Bank’s minority shareholders (Mr Dubilet, Mr Novikov \nand Triantal Investments).  These further deeds which, like the Initial Deed of Waiver, \nwere all governed by English law, appear to have been the product of Mr Kolomoisky’s \npartial compliance with his obligations under clause 3 of the Initial Deed of Waiver.  \nThey operated to release any claims the relevant counterparty had against Mr \nBogolyu bov arising out of his shareholding in the Bank or his chairmanship of the \nSupervisory Board for the  period after 1 July 2014.  Mr Bogolyubov’s entry into them \nand the Initial Deed of Waiver (together the “Deeds of Waiver and Indemnity”) was \ndescribed in his closing submissions as the point of greatest significance in relation to \nhis alleged control of the Bank.  \n674.

Mr Bogolyubov’s entry into them \nand the Initial Deed of Waiver (together the “Deeds of Waiver and Indemnity”) was \ndescribed in his closing submissions as the point of greatest significance in relation to \nhis alleged control of the Bank.  \n674. Notwithstanding the language of clause 3 of the Initial Deed of Waiver, there was no \nevidence that Mr Bogolyubov became party to similar deeds of waiver with the minority \nshareholders other than Mr Dubilet, Mr Novikov and Triantal Investments, although \nthe trial bundle did contain an undated draft of a further deed for signature by the Bank.  \nThere was no evidence that this was ever executed.  \n675. In its Reply, the Bank put Mr Bogolyubov to proof of the authenticity of the Initial \nDeed of Waiver and specifically pleaded that Mr Bogolyubov was not able to delegate \nor abrogate his duties as chairman of the Supervisory Board, whether by acting at the \nsole direction of Mr Kolomoisky or at all.  The latter point is one to which I will revert \na little later, but it seems to me that Mr Bogolyubov is correct to submit that the Bank \ndoes not in substance maintain that the Deeds of Waiver and Indemnity were no t \nauthentic as documents, but rather that they did not accord with the reality of the \nsituation, which was that Mr Bogolyubov “continued to have a role in the Bank”.  \nIndeed it is clear that the aspects of the entry into the Deeds of Waiver and Indemnity \non which the Bank placed most reliance were (a) the reasons they were entered into, (b) \nthe reasons they were then kept secret and (c) the reasons why Mr Bogolyubov had not \ninstituted any proceedings against Mr Kolomoisky under the indemnity.  \n676. The Bank relied on a number of considerations to support its argument that whatever \nmight have been recorded in the Deeds of Waiver and Indemnity, there was in fact no \noral agreement made between Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov in July 2014.  The \nfirst is that there are no other documents dating from the period between July 2014 and \nMay 2015 which refer to or evidence in any manner the oral agreement alleged.  This \nis despite the fact s that the court made an order for specific disclosure in relation to the \nnegotiation and conclusion of what was alleged to have been the oral agreement and no \ndocuments were disclosed by Mr Bogolyubov , and t hat Mr Bogolyubov  continued  to \nchair Supervisory Board meetings (there were 35 during the period bet ween the alleged \noral agreement and 12 May 2015) and to carry out his other duties as chair man without \nrecording that he was doing so at the sole direction of Mr  Kolomoisky.  \n677. These included regular communication s with the NBU in relation to the grant of nine \nstabilisation loans  and the regular signing of loan repayment schedules .  It is also \nstrikingly inconsistent with Mr Bogolyubov’s  position that, during the course of \nDecember 2014, March 2015 and April 2015 , he joined with Mr Kolomoisky in \ngrant ing security for some of these stabilisation loans over his own person al assets , with \nno contemporaneous  evidence that , at the time th is security was granted , he had any \nclaim against  Mr Kolomoisky if that security were ever to be called on , or that he ever \ntold the NBU that th is was the case.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n169 \n 678. The second is that M r Bogolyubov  has not himself explained in evidence , and has not \ncalled evidence from any other individual  to confirm , the basic elements of the alleged \noral agreement, including the words used , who they were expressed by and to whom, \nand when and where they were spoken ; nor is there any evidence from Mr Kolomoisky  \nwhich supports the case now made by Mr Bogolyubov.

Indeed it goes rather further \nthan that because in Mr Kolomoisky’s own abandoned evidence, which was referred to \non this poi nt in submissions made by both the Bank and Mr Bogolyubov, it was said \nthat the only agreement actually reached on this topic was that reflected in the Deeds \nof Waiver and Indemnity themselves, the discussions for which did not commence until \n2015.  The mo st that could be said arising out of Mr Kolomoisky’s abandoned witness \nstatement was that discussions in relation to splitting their joint assets had started in \n2014 after Mr Kolomoisky became a politically exposed person as a result of his \nappointment as governor of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, but that no agreement was reached \nat that stage.  Such evidence as there was from Mr Kolomoisky was that agreement as \nto how to proceed was not in the event reached until after a particular aspect of \nUkrainian law was cha nged in 2015, which I infer was shortly before the Initial Deed \nof Waiver was executed.  \n679. The third is that there is no record that, during the period between the conclusion of \nwhat was said to be the oral agreement reached in July 2014 and the execution of the \nInitial Deed of Waiver, Mr Bogolyubov voted his shares and acted as chairman at Mr \nKolomoisky’s direction.  Mr Bogolyubov does not point to anything which contradicts \nthis as a matter of fact, but says that this does not counteract the existence of clear \nevidence of the agreement in the Deeds of Waiver and Indemnity themselves.  I \ndisagre e.  In my view, if there had been the agreement alleged, there would have been \nsome trace of its existence or some contemporaneous indication that this was the way \nthey were now operating.  None were drawn to my attention.  \n680. As to the Deeds of Waiver and Indemnity, it is stressed by the Bank that there is no \nevidence that the Bank itself was a party to any of them – there was certainly no version \nexecuted by the Bank.  On that basis alone, therefore, they do not give Mr Bogoly ubov \na defence to the Bank’s claims.  Indeed, I did not understand Ms Montgomery to \ncontend to the contrary, and to that extent the Bank has created something of a straw \nman.  She also accepted in her oral opening that the first RSAs were entered into befo re \nthe date to which the Deeds of Waiver and Indemnity related back.  It followed, as she \nput it, that “it’s not a get out of jail free card in that sense”.  This is correct and, as the \nBank pointed out, the 1 July 2014 date was after many of the Relevant Loans had been \nagreed and many of the Relevant Drawdowns had been made.  However, their \nsignificance is said by Mr Bogolyubov to be not so much that they might function in \nthemselves as a defence to the Bank’s claim, but rather that they evidence what was \nhappening on the ground.  They are therefore said to corroborate Mr Bogolyubov’s case \non the extent to which he had stepped back from active participation in the Bank’s \naffairs, anyway during the period after June 2014.  \n681. The Bank disagreed, and submitted that the form of the Initial Deed of Waiver in fact \nsupport s its case.  Its significance lies in the fact that the very wide -ranging indemnities \nextend not just to Mr Bogolyubov’s own negligence and gross negligence, but also to \nhis own “fraudulent or otherwise unlawful acts”.  It is said that the obvious inference  \nto be drawn from his failure to explain why he required a waiver extending to fraudulent \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n170 \n acts is that he knew that he had committed fraudulent acts between July 2014 and 12 \nMay 2015 and that "}

I think that there is some substance in the fact that the Deeds of Waiver and Indemnity \nwere entered into in the form they were because Mr Bogolyubov was concerned about \nfraud in the most general sense.  However, although I agree with the Bank’s submission  \nthat an indemnity against fraudulent conduct is unusual, I do not think that the inclusion \nof such words indicates of itself that he knew he had been dishonest in the period \nsubsequent to 1 July 2014 (although it is certainly consistent with such a state of mind).  \nWhat is more probable is that he knew that the manner in which the Bank’s affairs had \nbeen conducted meant that he might find himself at the end of proceedings alleging that \nhe had been party to or otherwise implicated in fraudulent activity, an d he was \nsufficiently concerned to cover himself against that eventuality given that he anticipated \nthat, going forward, he might find himself in a less influential position to control the \ncourse that such proceedings might take.  \n683. The Bank also relied on the fact that the July 2014 oral agreement and the Deeds of \nWaiver and Indemnity were kept secret from the Bank’s auditors.  This is clear from \nthe fact that its financial statements audited by PwC for both 2014 and 2015 contained \nthe following statement:  \n“As of [the relevant year end, and the previous year end]  according to the share \nregisters the ultimate major shareholders of the Bank were Mr I.V. Kolomoyskiy \nand Mr G.B. Bogolyubov who as at [the relevant year end] owned directly and \nindirectly respectively [relevant percentage shareholdings] of the outstanding  \nshares and neither of which individually controlled the Bank. The major \nshareholders of the Bank did not have a contractual agreement on joint control of \nthe Bank.”  \n684. A similar representation was made to EY for the purposes of the EY Related Parties \nReport , in relation to which the language to be used was subject to discussion both \nwithin the Bank and with EY (I referred to it in paragraph 631 above).  The words \nsettled on were: “… none of the shareholders of the Bank is to be considered as its \ncontroller, because each of them [has less than a 50% shareholding] and there is no \nagreement between them that enables such impact” .   I agree with the Bank that , if the \nDeeds of Waiver and Indemnity were genuine, the way in which the position was \nexpressed both in the Bank’s financial statements and in the EY Related Parties Report \nwas seriously misleading.  \n685. It was submitted on behalf of Mr Bogolyubov that the fact the agreements were not \nmade public is consistent with the concern stated on the face of the Initial Deed of \nWaiver that it would damage public confidence in the Bank and the Ukrainian financial \nsystem more generally if it was known that Mr Bogolyubov no longer wished to be \nassociated with the Bank (see the second recital I referred to above).  I can see that that \nmight be the case, but for the chairman of a bank to suggest it is appropriate to hide \nfrom that bank’s auditors, regulators and the public at large the fact that he no longer \nwishes to be associated with the bank and is no longer able to exercise his rights as \nshareholder and his duties as chairman of the Supervisory Board free of the instr uctions \nfrom his co -shareholder is a remarkable proposition.

The Bank said that one of the other striking aspects of the entering into of the Deeds of \nWaiver and Indemnity is that, like the anterior oral agreement said to have been reached \nin July 2014, there is almost no contemporaneous documentation relating to their \nexecution  or implementation .  Given the significant nature of what was proposed, that \nis very surprising.  The Bank also submitted that the total absence of documentation \nrelating to the practical operation of the Deeds of Waiver and Indemnity raises d eep \nsuspicions about the purposes for which the documentation was entered into and \nwhether it did in fact reflect or record the true position. The trial bundle contained only \ntwo letters by which Mr Kolomoisky gave Mr Bogolyubov an instruction to act in a \nparticular manner pursuant to his rights under the Deed s of Waiver  and Indemnity, both \na long time later : one in March 2016 in relation to a company called Fransiano and one \non 27 September 2016 instructing Mr Bogolyubov to sign a draft letter to Ms Gontar eva \nat the NBU.  \n687. Both were addressed to Mr Bogolyubov at his London address, which the Bank said \nwas also surprising because the evidence is that, by the end of September, his marriage \nhad broken down and he was no longer living in London.  I did not find this a very \npersu asive submission because, although some of the evidence from the Bogolyubov \nmatrimonial proceedings indicated that he left the UK shortly after the family returned \nfrom a holiday in March 2016 that year, there is other evidence that he was visiting the \nmatrimonial home in Belgrave Square on a relatively regular basis and had not yet \nrelocated to Switzerland, which only occurred at the beginning of 2017.  In light of that \nevidence I do not find it particularly surprising that correspondence was addressed to \nhim at Belgrave Square.  \n688. The Bank said that the metadata of these documents cast doubt on whether they were \ncontemporaneous instructions, because it appeared to show that they were created in \n2019.  However, I am not prepared to proceed on the basis that this was the case, \nbecause  Mr Bogolyubov’s solicitors confirmed that they had originally been received \nfrom their client in hard copy, which meant that the applicable metadata was by its very \nnature unrelated to the date of the documents’ creation.  Of more significance is the fact  \nthat there is no contemporaneous corroborating evidence such as e -mails, replies to the \nrelevant instruction or witness evidence that they were indeed sent and received.  \n689. Indeed, such evidence as exists is more consistent with the Deeds of Waiver and \nIndemnity not accurately recording Mr Bogolyubov’s continuing active interest in the \naffairs of the Bank, because he was held out, anyway by Mr Kolomoisky, in a manner \nwhich wa s inconsistent with the apparent language of the Initial Deed of Waiver.  Thus, \nat meetings with the NBU during the course of the summer of 2016 (i.e., over a year \nlater), Mr Kolomoisky was still representing to the NBU that he needed to check with \nMr Bogo lyubov before he could agree to various points in relation to the Restructuring \nPlan and indeed that “some steps should"}

While an ordinary \nshareholder is likely to have an interest in any restructuring plan, this is difficult to \nunderstand if, as the Initial Deed of Waiver recorded, he had for some time been “voting \nhis shares in Privatbank … at the sole direction of” Mr Kolomoisky.  I should add that \nMs Rozhkova knew that Mr Bogolyubov was not based in Ukraine and assumed that \nthis was the reason why issues relating to the Bank were led by Mr Kolomoisky.  \nAlthough this was only an assumption, she was not challenged on the basis for the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n172 \n assumption and it is inconsistent with the idea that Mr Bogolyubov was not continuing \nwith his participation in the affairs of the Bank.  \n690. In my judgment, the evidence justifies a conclusion that it is unlikely that the oral \nagreement pleaded by Mr Bogolyubov was reached in July 2014.  I find that it was not.  \nI also consider that the consequence of this finding is that the Deeds of Waiver an d \nIndemnity were seriously misleading in the impression they expressly gave as to the \nprior existence of an oral agreement, which had not in fact been reached.  I have also \nreached the conclusion that, although the Deeds of Indemnity and Waiver  were \nprobab ly signed when  they purported to be signed in May and June 2015  and to that \nextent were authentic,  they did not reflect the true nature of Mr Bogolyubov’s role in \nrelation to the Bank going forward, and were not intended to do so.  If they had been , \nthey would not have been kept secret and the public representations that the major \nshareholders of the Bank did not have a contractual agreement on joint control of the \nBank  could not have been made.   Furthermore, it is unlikely that Mr Bogolyubov would \nhave con tinued to conduct himself in relation to the affairs of the Bank thereafter as he \ndid to the extent described elsewhere in this judgm ent. \n691. What might happen if Mr Bogolyubov were to seek to enforce them against Mr \nKolomoisky is a matter of speculation , but I do not think that they give the support to \nMr Bogolyubov ’s defence to this claim  that he maintains .  In short , they do not provide \nany material evidence that he was as “hands -off” in relation to the Bank’s affairs as he \nseeks to contend.  I am therefore driven to the conclusion that it was dishonest for Mr \nBogolyubov to use them for the purpose of bolstering his case that he had already gi ven \nup to Mr Kolomoisky his freedom to act at a stage when no such agreement had in fact \nbeen reached.   I also consider that , even after they were signed,  it was highly misleading \nof him to allow the Bank’s auditors and the NBU to proceed on the basis that he still \nfulfilled his role as chair man (and then member) of the Supervisory Board of the Bank \nif he had an enforceable right to in effect delegate those duties to Mr Kolomoisky . \n \nSummary of the influence and control of the Individual Defendants  \n692. Against the background I have just described, although there are important differences \nbetween the Individual Defendants as to the way in which they exercised their influence \nover the affairs of the Bank, the evidence points to both of them playing a significant \nrole not just in supervising  the Bank’s affairs but also in giving informal and often \nunrecorded instructions and approvals to the Bank’s management in relation to the \nconduct of its a"}

In my view, the Individual Defendants exercised their influence \nover the Bank in a manner w hich is capable of being characterised as control.  It \noperated in a more immediate sense than simply exercising their rights through the \nmedium of the General Meeting and the Supervisory Board  and to that extent, they were \nboth much more than disinterested investors. Their influence was materially more \npervasive than that.  \n693. I have also concluded that the Bank’s management was conditioned to acting in \naccordance with their instructions and in what they conceived to be the interests of the \nIndividual Defendants.  The nature of the relationship between the Individual \nDefendants and the members of the Bank’s management means that it is most \nimprobable that the members of the Management Board would have authorised the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n173 \n implementation of any strategic decisions in relation to the conduct of its business \nwithout what they considered to be the approval of the Individual Defendants , \nparticularly where those decisions related to something as significant as the operation \nof a loan recycling scheme which they must have known to be unlawful.    This \ncontinued to be the case throughout the active period of the Misappropriation, although \nI also find that by the time the Deeds of Waiver and Indemnity were entered into, Mr \nBogolyubov was starting the process of stepping away from the involvement that he \nhad in the Bank’s affairs, a process which was anyway partially implemented when he \nwas replaced as chairman of the Supervisory Board in mid June 2015.  \n694. I have also concluded that, in the absence of any evidence from the Individual \nDefendants that they had no knowledge of strategic decisions taken by the Management \nBoard and cannot for that reason be said to have authorised them, the balance of \nprobability  is that they did.  As will appear, this is one but only one of the reasons why \nI have rejected the Defendants’ case that the Individual Defendants did not know about \nor authorise the Relevant Loans and did not participate to that extent in the \nMisappropri ation.  The Bank has adduced very strong circumstantial evidence that they \ndid, and that the suggestion that the Bank’s senior management were off on a frolic of \ntheir own is fanciful.  \n695. It is a central part of the Bank’s case that , not only the Bank itself, but also all of the \nother entities involved in the Misappropriation (viz. the Borrowers, the Intermediary \nBorrowers, the New Borrowers, the Corporate Defendants  and the ED P rincipals ) were \nowned and/or controlled by one or both of the Individual Defendants .  Similar, but not \nidentical issues, are said to arise in relation to the ownership and control of  the Share \nPledgors .  In reaching my conclusions on this aspect of the case, the findings I have \nalready made as to the level of control which the Individual Defendants exercised over \nPBC and Primecap are of  relevance , as are my findings in relation to the manner in \nwhich the Individual Defendants exercised their influence and control over the affairs \nof the Bank.  \n696.

In large part \nthe Individual Defendants deny the totality of this part of the Bank’s case.  In summary, \nboth of the Individual Defendants admit to having held an ownership interest in some \nof the Borrowers and the Intermedia ry Borrowers during the  period of the \nMisappropriation, but they both deny any personal  control of any of them, anyway on \na day -to-day basis.   They also deny that they owned or controlled any of the New \nBorrowers or that they owned any of the Corporate Defendants or the ED Principals .   \n \nOwnership and control of the Borrow ers and Intermediary  Borrowers  \n697. As Mr Anderson put it i n the Bank’s closing submissions there remained two live issues \nin relation to the Borrowers and the Relevant Loans. The first was whether the \nIndividual Defendants procured the Relevant Loans and the Relevant Drawdowns. The \nsecond was whether they owned and /or controlled the Borrowers .   The two questions \nare intimately interlinked , becau se it is most improbable that the Relevant Loans would \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n174 \n have been entered into by the Borrowers in the absence of specific or general consent  \nfrom the individuals by whom they were controlled .  By the end of the trial there was \nno real issue that the loans to the Borrowers and the Intermediary Borrowers  were  all \nagreed for the purposes of making prepayment under the sham RSAs in a manner which \nwas clandestine and contrary to all principles of prudent banking.  \n698. The Bank alleges that the true beneficial owners of each of the Borrowers were the \nIndividual Defendants (or one of them) and tha t a large number of individuals  said by \nthe Individual Defendants to be the beneficial owners of a Borrower are in fact no more \nthan nominees for the  Individual Defendants.   This is denied by both of them, a lthough \nby the commencement of the trial Mr Kolomoisky had admitted to having an interest \nin 21 of the Borrowers and 14 of the Intermediary Borrowers while Mr Bogolyubov \nhad ad mitted to having an interest in 19  of the Borrowers and 13 of the Intermediary \nBorrowers . \n699. As the majority of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers in which one of the \nIndividual Defendants admitted an interest was an entity in which the other Individual \nDefendant also admitted an interest, approximately half of the Borrowers and half of \nthe Intermediary Borrowers  fell into this category .  For the most part , these admitted \ninterests were small percentages, but in respect of four Borrowers (Alf atrader : 90% , \nDorteks  LLC  (“Dorteks”) :100% , Prado : c.55%  and Uniks : 100% ) and one Intermediary \nBorrower (A ftotradeinvest  LLC  (“Aftotradeinvest”) : 100% ), the admitted interests of \nthe Individual Defendants taken together exceeded 50% for all or a material part of the \nperiod in wh ich the Misappropriation was said to be taking place  and in the case of \nDorteks and Aftotradeinvest amounted to 100% . \n700. These admissions were said by the Bank to indicate of themselves that the Individual \nDefendants  controlled all of the Borrowers , because the nature of the scheme was such \nthat it made no sense for the Borrowers not to be under common ownership and control .  \nThe Bank also submitted that the  ownership interests  disclosed by  these admissions  \nwere in fact the tip of the iceberg .

It was said that there was a mass of additional  \nevidence which established not just that a significant number of the Borrowers and \nIntermediary Borrowers were entities in which the Individual Defendants had an \ninterest , but also that the court should conclude on t he balance of probabilities that they \nwere all controlled by the Individual Defendants , in large part through the medium of a \ncomplex web of entities and nominees, all of whom operated both as to ownership and \ncontrol as mere ciphers of the Individual Defendants.   Much of this  evidence  is \ncircumstantial, but looking at it as a whole, it is said to amount to  compelling proof of \nthe Bank’s case on this issue.  \n701. The Bank submitted  that the Borrowers were used in near -identical ways, which itself \nis strong evidence  that the Individual Defendants also owned and controlled the other \nBorrowers.   It also demonstrated that in one instance (AEF  LLC (“AEF”) was given as \nthe example ), Mr Bogolyubov  acquired what was said to a be a new interest  in a shell \ncompan y which  was already  heavily indebted to the Bank .  In another (Alfatrader was \ngiven as the example) , Mr Kolomoisky  disposed of his 45% interest in Alfatrader  when \nit was already  indebted pursuant to a Relevant Loan for UAH 16 0 million and the n \nreacquired a 2 0% indirect interest seven months later .

I agree.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n175 \n 702. More generally, i t was said that the extent of the fluctuations over time of the Individual \nDefendants’  admitted interests in  some of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers \nwas all part of a game of cat and mouse played by BOK, PBC and Primecap which \ninvolved hiding the Bank’s related party lending  by shuffling the ownership of \nBorrowers to obscure the true picture from the NBU.   I think that the Bank is probably \nright about that, not least  because  there was never any evidenced explanation for why \nthe Individual Defendant s’ disclosed interests in th ose of the Borrowers , which were \nthe subject of their admission s, fluctuated in the way they did.   No legitimate credible \nexplanation has been advanced by the Individual Defendants, and I have concluded that \nthe Bank is correct to submit that, whatever the precise reason, what occurred obscured \nthe true position and is at the very least consistent with all of the Borrower s and the \nIntermediary Borrowers being compani es owned and controlled by the Individual \nDefendants.  \n703. The Bank also point ed out that , despite their admissions of ownership interests in \nAlfatrader, Dorteks, Prado and Uniks  (in which they admit  to having held all or more \nthan 50% of the issued shares ) and which between them entered into ten Relevant and \nIntermediary Loans between 17 February 2014 and 3 September 2014 , with a \ncumulative value of US$99 million and UAH 1.66 billion , the Individual Defendants  \nhave not adduced any evidence to explain why  they did so.  It is submitted that t he \nreason for this is obvious: there is no innocent explanation.   While both of the Individual \nDefendants  pleaded that they did not exercise day -to-day control over any of the \nBorrowers , including these four companies , it is not positively asserted that they  did \nnot exercise any "}

It is submitted that t he \nreason for this is obvious: there is no innocent explanation.   While both of the Individual \nDefendants  pleaded that they did not exercise day -to-day control over any of the \nBorrowers , including these four companies , it is not positively asserted that they  did \nnot exercise any overall control over any of them and I am satisfied that this is what \nthey did.  Alfatrader, Dorteks, Prado and Uniks  would not have been used as part of a \nloan recycling scheme or as vehicles for the Misappropriation without the actual or tacit \napproval of the Individual Defendants , which is very strong evidence that they would \nhave known all about the  nature of the scheme . \n704. One of the facts on which the Bank relies is the speed with which Mr Kolomoisky was \nable to put together the Lafferty Spreadsheets  at the time of the jurisdiction challenge \nand the access which he had to the thousands of bank statements from which they were \nsaid to have been prepared.   Taken alone, this may not establish control of the \nBorrowers by one or both of the Individual  Defendants , but the ease with which Mr \nKolomoisky was apparently able to access the bank statements of the  Lafferty \nSpreadsheets Companies , includ ing as they did all but one of the  Borrowers, is said to \nbe a telling indication that the relationship was at the very least a very close one.   Like \nmany of the other points it is not conclusive in itself, but I agree that it supports the \nBank’s overall submission.  \n705. There a re a number of further indications which are consistent with  the relationship \nbeing one of control and not just proximity .  The first is the  actual  ownership structure \nfor each Borrower and Inter mediary Borrower , which for the purposes of the trial has \nbeen recorded  in two categories of chart .  The information disclosed in these charts has \nbeen derived by the Bank from a number of different sources , including miscellaneous \ncontemporaneous documentation disclosed during the course of the proceedings  and \nfurther information given by one o r other of the Individual Defendants in response to \nrequests from the Bank .  While the Defendants do not accept the conclusions to be \ndrawn from these charts, which  are said by them to have limited evidential value, the \nbasic factual information which they contain and portray  is not positively disputed.   The \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n176 \n Defendants do, however, contend that the material on which some of the connections \nrelied on by the Bank is  based is sometimes tenuous and sometimes based on second -\nhand information; it therefore needs to be treated with caution.  \n706. I accept th at there is some substance in those words of warning, and I have taken them \ninto account when assessing the evidence as whole .  I also agree that t he burden remain s \non the Bank to establish its allegations t hat the Borrowers and the Intermediary \nBorrowers were owned and/or controlled by the Individual Defendants .  Nevertheless I \nalso take into account the fact that in his opening submissions Mr Kolomoisky said that \nhe would address in his closing submissions the specific inferences which the Ba nk \nseeks to draw  from the information disclosed by the charts , but in the event chose not \nto do so.   I also take into account the fact that the Defendants chose not to call any \nevidence at all from the individuals concerned in order to counter those inferences .  No \nreasons were advanced as to why they chose not to do so, apart from to say that it was \nunnecessary because the Bank’s case was misconceived in the way it was formulated.  \n707. As will become apparent, I do not accept that the Bank’s case was misconceived in it"}

No \nreasons were advanced as to why they chose not to do so, apart from to say that it was \nunnecessary because the Bank’s case was misconceived in the way it was formulated.  \n707. As will become apparent, I do not accept that the Bank’s case was misconceived in its \nformulation .  I also think that , if there were to have been an answer to the inferences \nwhich the Bank invites the court to draw from the information disclosed on the charts, \nthe Individual Defendants would have sought to explain what it was , with the assistance \nof at least one of the many individuals who participated in the complex corporate \nstructures which are illustrated by these charts  and who might be thought able to verify \ntheir case.  In my view, taken together with a number of other considerations, t he \nabsence of such evidence  supports an inference that the Individual Defendants chose \nnot to take that course , because  if they had done so,  it would have become obvious that \nthose who were recorded as UBOs of the Borrowers and the Intermediary Borrowers \nwere in fact no more than nominees  for them .  \n708. The first  category of chart s relate to the corporate structure for each  Borrower  as at the \ndate it first entered into a Relevant Loan and  each Intermediary Borrower  at the date it \nfirst entered into  an Intermediary Loan.  Each structure chart illustrate s the chain of \ninterests in  the share holdings  in each of the Borrowers  as at the  relevant  date.  In some \ninstances the structure chart showing the chain of interests is byzantine in its \ncomplex ity, with a number of other entities and individuals holding varied direct and \nindirect minority interests in the shares issued by the Borrower , while the shares in \nmany of those other entities themselves were also widely held by yet further holding \ncompanies or individuals acting as nominees.  In others the corporate family trees are \nless complex with a single entity or individual recorded either as the sole hol der of \n100% of the shares in the Borrower or as  a direct or indirect holding company of the \nBorrower.  \n709. Where one or both of the Individual Defendants admit that they hold an interest in a \nBorrower or an Intermediary Borrower, that interest is reflected  as an ultimate \nbeneficial ownership interest in the relevant structure chart.  In many instances th ese \nadmitted  interests  are themselves held through a complex web of other entities and \nnominees  many  of whom are employees or officers of PBC or the Bank .  In all but a \nvery few cases, the remaining ultimate beneficial interests are then recorded in the \nstructure  charts as being held by  some 37  nominees , 24 of whom were employees of \nPBC  and six of whom were employees of the Bank , again through a complex web of \nother entities and nominees .  In some instances the UBO  of a Borrower o r Intermediary  \nBorrower  is said to be a single individual , but in many others th e number of  individuals \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n177 \n said to hold the ultimate beneficial ownership in one of several fractional interest s in a \nBorrower o r Intermediary  Borrower runs into double figures . \n710. A small number of the recorded UBO s of a fractional interest in a Borrower or \nIntermediary Borrower are not officers or employees of PBC, but the majority are.  The \nsame individuals appear time and again as UBO s of fractional interests in different \nBorrowers and Intermediary Borrowers.  Thus by way of example, ten PBC employees  \n(Tetyana Akimova, Mr Akudovich, Mr Kolobkov, Ms Kravchenko, Mr Melnyk, Mr \nNikolenko, Olena Pivovar, Mr I Pugach, Ms Trykulych and Yulia Velk) were recorded \nas UBO s of an interest "}

One of the sources of the Bank’s information for recording particular individuals as \nUBO s of an interest in each Borrower or Intermediary Borrower  has been called the \nBeneficiary Key and was prepared after the time  at which what the Bank has called the \nactive period of the Misappropriation , had come to an end.  The NBU was becoming \nmore active in its investigations of the extent of the Bank’s exposure to related parties.  \nIn that context, the Bank’s risk management department sent a memo to Mr Dubilet \nseeki ng access to data on clients of the Bank’s Cyprus branch.  In particular it sought \naccess to information on the nominee and beneficial owners, executives, chairmen and \nmembers of the Supervisory Board of borrowers at the Cyprus branch.   This memo \nfound its way to a number of recipients including Mr Morgachov, Mr Novikov and Mr \nYatsenko, the latter of whom refused to allow access to this information from outside \nCyprus.  \n712. The documentary evidence which has s urvived supports the Bank’s case that what \nhappened next was that  an alternative solution was reached involv ing the preparation \nof an Excel spreadsheet which identified 32 beneficiaries and then allocated a \nbeneficiary number to each of them.  Amongst those beneficiaries were each of the \nindividuals I have just mentioned  as well as Mr Bogolyubov identified as B4 and the \nIndividual Defendants together identified as B9.  With the assistance of this information  \nit has been p ossible to identify the individuals who are disclosed on the structure charts \nas UBO s of each of the Borrowers , recorded as such in documentation discovered \nwithin the Bank . \n713. The Bank’s case is that , despite their characterisation as such , these individuals are not \nin any sense the UBO s of the Borrowers .  This is said to be a misleading  description of \ntheir true status , because they were in fact nominees for the Individual Defendants, and \nto describe them as UBO s is wrong in the same way and to the same extent  as was the  \nconcept of a ‘nominee UBO ’, which was described by Bryan J in  Yurov  at [524] as a \ncontradiction in terms .  Set in the context of the later manipulation of the identity of the \nUBO s at a time when the NBU had started to probe the extent of the Bank’s loan book \nto related parties , the Bank submit ted, and I agree,  that what Bryan J went on to say  has \nresonance in the current case:  \n“… to purport to be someone you are not, and to purport to perform a role that you \ndo not perform (other than in name) is inherently dishonest and deceptive – and \nindeed the purpose of the use of nominee UBOs is equally obvious, namely to \ndeceive third partie s … and to render opaque both the link between the Bank and \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n178 \n particular companies/assets, and between the companies and the UBO s (the \nShareholders under the structures that were set up). ” \n714. The structure charts also disclose that, of the 110 intermediate shareholding companies \nthat appear  within them, 54 also appear in the Individual Defendants’  WFO a sset \ndisclosure as holding assets on their behalf , 57 were Lafferty Spreadsheets Companies \nand nine are Share Pledge Companies .

The structure charts also disclose that, of the 110 intermediate shareholding companies \nthat appear  within them, 54 also appear in the Individual Defendants’  WFO a sset \ndisclosure as holding assets on their behalf , 57 were Lafferty Spreadsheets Companies \nand nine are Share Pledge Companies .  These companies also appear in the Individual \nDefendants’  disclosed  contemporaneous asset lists (dating from prior to \nnationalisation)  and in the structures by which they admit  to holding their interests in \nthe Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers between 2013 and 2016 .  Furthermore, o nly \n15 of the intermediate shareholding companies do not fall into any of these categories , \none of which is itself an Intermediary Borrower in whic h both Individual Defendants \nadmit to holding interests and the remainder of which disclosed  purported UBO s who \nwere PBC or Bank employees  or otherwise have close links to the Individual \nDefendants . \n715. The Bank submitted that one of the more striking aspects of these charts is that the \nentities  in respect of which the Individual Defendants  have admitted that PBC \nindividuals are acting as their nominees  pursuant to undocumented arrangements are \nheld within very similar  structures to Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers in respect \nof which no such admissions have been made , viz.,  a chain of companies ending with \na PBC individual held out as the UBO.   It is submitted that it is absurd that the \nIndividual Defendants have refused to make the same admission in respect of the \nBorrowers and Intermediary Borrowers and have identified the PBC individuals as \ngenuine UBOs of the Borrowers.   It is said that t he PBC individuals identified as the \nnominal UBOs of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers are plainly nominees .  \nNot only is that what they did  as part of their job (and there was no evidence that any \nof them  had independent resources of their own) , it is said to be the only  explanation \nfor the chopping and changing apparent from what occurred at the time of the  \nLuchaninov e-mail, the Rokoman Spreadsheet s and the Avellum e-mails . That being \nso, the question for the court is: whose nominees were they? It is said that  in \ncircumstances in which the Individual Defendants have  admit ted using identical \nstructures and the very same people as nominees , usually pursuant to oral agreements, \nit can only be the Individual Defendants, not least because there is no evid ence that any \nother clients of PBC might fit the bill . \n716. The Individual Defendants do not dispute that, with very limited exceptions, the \nstructure charts accurately record the way in which the shares in each of the Borrowers \n(and other entities higher up the corporate tree) were held.   However, they deny that the \ncourt can infer from the information that the nominees who are disclosed as the UBO s \nof the identified interests in each relevant Borrower did in fact hold that interest as \nnominee.  In particular they assert that the manner in which the charts disclose  that the \nbeneficial own erships were held reflect s the true position , which is that in respect of the \nvast majority of the interests in the equity of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrower s \nheld by those identified employees of PBC or the Bank , those individuals held for their \nown account or at least did not hold for the benefit of or on behalf of either of the \nIndividual Defendants .  There was no evidence of substance to support this submissio n \nand in the absence of evidence from either of the Individual Defendants to explain how \nthe court can be satisfied that employees of a CSP  such as PBC are likely to be genuine \nUBOs of companies in such a structure, I agree that the Bank’s case on the fo rm of this \nApproved Jud"}

The second category  of cha rts is a series of 37 nominee  charts prepared for  each of the \nindividuals identified by the Defendants as being a  UBO  of an interest in one or more \nof the Borrowers or Interme diary Borrowers .  The y were prepared by the Bank to \nillustrate the connections between the Individual Defendants  and each of those \nindividuals.   Like the structure charts, the accuracy of the raw data which is contained \nwithin them is not challenged by the Defendants.  \n718. These charts  illustrate  that each recorded UBO  played  a role (often pursuant to an oral \nagreement) as an officer  or registered shareholder of other companies in which there is \nevidence that the Individual Defendants  themselves hold a controlling or minority direct \nor indirect interest.   These other roles were not disputed by the Individual Defendants.  \nOn the face of it, they evidence a relationship  between one or both of the Individual \nDefendants and each of the recorde d UBOs which was wider than the relationship \nwhich was said by the Bank to arise out of the status they had as nominees for the \nIndividual Defendants  in their holdings of interests in the Borrowers and the \nIntermediary Borr owers.   In short , it was submitted that , because many of the \nindividuals, almost all of whom were employees of PBC, fulfilled the status of \nnominees for the Individual Defendants in other contexts, it is probable that they \nfulfilled the same function in relation to the Borrowers and the Intermedi ary Borrowers.  \n719. As counsel for Mr Kolomoisky submitted, unlike the structure charts , the nominee \ncharts do not reflect the position at a particular moment in time , but record links which \nexisted across time .  To that extent they must obviously be treated with appropriate \ncaution , because  the issue of relevance is the extent to which the charts evidence the \nBank’s claim that the Borrowers and the Intermediary Borrowers were owned and/or \ncontrolled by one or both of the Individual Defendants at the time of the Relevant \nLoans .  However, that question is it self capable of being evidenced by the relationship \nbetween the recorded UBO s and the Individual Defendant s over a more extended \nperiod.  \n720. So far as nomineeships were concerned, counsel for Mr Kolomoisky submitted that  \nmany of the individual s identified on the charts were employees of  Primecap o r some \nother corporate service provider , who did not work exclusively for the Individual \nDefendants .  It was then submitted that it is commonplace in Ukraine and Cyprus for \nthe same professional nominees to perform roles in unrelated companies for a number \nof different principals .  It was also  said that the fact that some of these individuals \nperform ed roles for companies with which the Individual Defendants are associated  \ndoes not mean that any other companies for whom the same individuals perform roles \nwere associated with the Individual Defendants as well . \n721. In my view, this does not go very far as an explanation because  PBC is the only entity \nproviding corporate services whose employees feature as a recorded UBO .  The \nrecorded  UBO s fall into one of the following categories  and several fall into more than \none: 23 ind"}

The \nrecorded  UBO s fall into one of the following categories  and several fall into more than \none: 23 individuals who were employees of PBC , six individuals who were employees \nof the Bank , 33 individuals who have fulfilled executive or Supervisory Board roles in \nbusinesses in which one or both  of the Individual Defendants  hold an interest  and 23 \nindividuals in respect of whom there is evidence or an admission that the y hold their \ninterests in other entities for the benefit of one or both of the Individual Defendants .  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n180 \n Only five of the individuals amongst the recorded UBOs are not recorded as employees \nof PBC or the Bank (Nikita Aboyan,  Andrii Khomutov, Sergei Svyatchenko,  Vitalyi \nTymshyn  and Yevgen Zasimenko ).  \n722. It was submitted on behalf of Mr Bogolyubov that the relevant question for the court is \nnot whether he had (often technical) ownership interests, but whether he controlled the \nRelevant Entities and, more importantly, whether he was involved in the relevant acts \nsaid to comprise the scheme.  So far as it goes, that submission is plainly correct.  It \nwas said that in many cases it appears that companies that were at one time or in one \nrespect real trading companies were also used in the scheme as fungible she ll \ncompanies, without regard to any interest held by Mr Bogolyubov and without \nreference to him. He said that a  good example was Uniks, and that  as much of the \nevidence relied on by the Bank post -dates the scheme , this tells the court nothing.   In \nparticular, it was said that nothing can be read into the fact that Mr Bogolyubov has \ncontinued to use the same CSPs or the same individuals in relation to his assets.  \n723. It was also said that Mr Bogolyubov has always been open from the outset that his \nassets are held in complex structures and that he uses CSPs in the management and \nownership of these assets and structures.   It was asserted that t his has been the case long \nbefore any issues arose within the Bank.   In particular, he has declared interests in 233 \nassets, the ownership chains of which involve 281 holding companies and 109 \nindividuals.   It is said that h e has been upfront in disclosing these asset structures,  and \nindeed his interests in the Borrowers over the relevant period , including by providing \ndetails of nominee structures .  I accept that he has never hidden the complexity of his \nasset holding structures, but I do not accept that the history of the case shows that he \nhas always complied with his disclosure obligations, expeditiously or in full; he has not.  \n724. Reliance was also placed on the fact that Mr Bogolyubov disclosed interests in 13 \nBorrowers in the Defence served on 17 January 2020, together with interests in six \nfurther Borrowers added proactively in early 2023.   It was  point ed out that many of the \nmatters relied upon in the Bank’s structure charts come from admissions he has made.   \nIt was also said that his asset disclosure refers to many assets which are not in his name, \nincluding some of the companies the Bank has from the outset said are involved i n some \nway in the  scheme.  It was submitted that t his behaviour is not consistent with Mr \nBogolyubov seeking to hide his interests in assets where unhelpful for him or invoking \n“plausible deniability” where an asset is not in his name.  \n725.

It is also right for the c ourt to ask itself why the Individual Defendants  felt that they \nneeded to make any admissions of ownership at all .  The Bank  suggested that the reason \nappea red to be that, by the time th ey came to plead their Defences,  there was already a \npaper trail connecting the Individual Defendants to the Borrowers and the Intermediary \nBorrowers in which they admitted  an interest .  It pointed out that many of Mr \nBogolyubov’s admissions  relate d to companies in a group headed by Modena,  which I \nhave already referred to in my discussion of PBC .  Modena  is identified  in related -party \nshareholder representation letters to PwC  produced in early 2016 , in draft related -party \ndisclosures as an entity “controlled” by Mr Bogolyubov  and as 100% owned by Mr \nBogolyubov in his pleading in the Tatneft Proceedings and in his 2018 WFO a sset \ndisclosure, given on 19 January 20 18, some time before  he was required to plead his \nDefence in these proceedings. The rest of his admitted interests are also each held via \nat least one company that appears in the asset disclosures he made before he pleaded \nhis Defence .  As for Mr Kolomoisky,  with one exception  (Jaco Management Limited, \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n181 \n a holding company for the Intermediary Borrower Avtotradeinvest ), his admissions are \nin respect of interests ultimately held by companies in which he admitted an interest in \nhis 2018 asset disclosure.  \n726. I accept that the mere fact that an employee of a CSP such as PBC is recorded as a UBO \nof one or more of the Borrowers or Intermediary Borrowers does not establish that \neither of the Individual Defendants was in fact the owner and/or controller of that \nBorrower or Intermediary Borrower  concerned.  B ut that is not the only aspect of what \noccurred on which the Bank relies.  To do so would be to  divorce  the evidence from its \nproper  context .  To revert to the approach adopted in Yurov, the nature of circumstant ial \nevidence is that its effect is cumulative, and the essence of a successful case based on \ncircumstantial evidence is that the whole is stronger than its individual parts.  \n727. In the present case, the relevant  context includes the matters I have already considered \nsuch as the similarity of the se apparent  holding structures to the manner in which \nadmitted assets are held by the Individual Defendants, but it also includes other \nevidence as to what occurred as part of the working through of the scheme.   One aspec t \nof this is the findings I have made regarding the relationship between PBC and the \nIndividual Defendants (as to which see paragraphs 256ff above) . Another was the \nLuchaninov e -mail, the significance of which I have explained in paragraphs 449 to 462 \nabove  and the related party discussion which  went on in the Autumn of 2015 .  Those \ndiscussions were in response to  the production of the EY Related Part ies Report , which \nhad caused the NBU to conclude that  165 (later reduced to 136) of the Bank’s borrowers \nwere related parties  (of which more than 20 were Borrowers) .  The Bank’s response \nalso incorporated  the production of the Rokoman  Spreadsheet s and critically the steps \ntaken to change the PBC nominee directors and UBOs of 19 Borrowers and five \nIntermediary Borrowers . \n728.

The Bank’s response included taking the advice from Avellum I have already referred \nto, but what it ultimately did was reflected in correspondence between  Mr Luchaninov,  \nMr Yatsenko, Ms Gurieva and Mr Novikov .  It is clear from that correspondence that \nwhat then occurred can properly be described as a juggling  of the individuals who were \nto be recorded as being the UBOs of the various borrower entities .  There was no  \nreference to any third party  who might be characterised as an independ ent owner of any \nof those entities  and there is no explanation  as to how or why any independent third \nparty might be able to (or wish to) use the Bank’s loan recycling scheme  as a source of \nsham loans to their own borrowing vehicles.  \n729. I agree with the Bank’s submission that the fact that it was possible for employees \nwithin BOK to juggle the nominees as they did is inconsistent with any case that these \nnominees in fact represented some unidentified independent third -party owner.   I accept \nthe Bank’s submission that the only way in which this could have been done was if all \nof the lending was to entities who stand behind the same individuals  who stand behind \nall of the nominee UBOs .  All the indications are that all the participants in th e scheme \nwere under common control .  As the Bank put it in closing , those ultimate controllers \nwere in a position to manipulate the nominee UBO s to give the appearance of \ncompliance with credit ratios when in fact the new UBOs  are just further nominees . \n730. The Bank also relied on the inferences to be drawn from the security which was given \nfor the Relevant Loans , and in particular the Share Pledges .  I have explained what \nhappened in paragraphs 359 to 366 above.   It was admitted that 22 of the 38 Share \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n182 \n Pledgors and 20 of the 25 companies whose shares had been pledged were owned and/or \ncontrolled by one or both of them. However , they contended that they had no actual \nknowledge at the time the pledges were granted that the y were being granted as security \nfor the Relevant Loans.   \n731. The Bank  submitt ed that there was no evidence of any general agreement between the \nBank and either of the Individual Defendants  for their assets to be used in this manner  \nand it is inherently incredible to suppose that the Individual Defendants agreed to \npledge their assets as security for lending to unconnected borrowers on an open -ended  \nbasis .  It is said that no rational commercial businessmen would offer such collateral \nfor loans to wholly unknown entities  and that t he only credible explanation is that the \nIndividual Defendants  knew that the scheme to extract money from the Bank for their \nbenefit required some ostensibly credible  security.  It is said that they therefore agreed \nthat their assets could be used to create the appearance of security for lending to their \nown shell companies (i.e. the Borrowers ), although they were in fact all shams.  This \nwas also said to have been confirmed by the fact that the Share Pledges were never \nenforced – and were released shortly before nationalisation.  It was said that this was a \nstriking indication that the Share Pledges were never intended by the Individual \nDefendants or the Bank to create enforceable obligations.  \n732. The Bank also pointed to evidence that the Share Pledges were all created, executed \nand backdated in the same way , and that of the 16 Share Pledgors where ownership \nand/or control is denied, seven participated in the Misappropriation as Lafferty \nSpreadsheets Companies , two of which ( Celastrina and Densitron ) were two of"}

Of the five companies whose shares were pledged where \nownership  and/or control was denied, two are Lafferty Spreadsheets Companies . \n733. In my view the Bank’s case on the significance of the Share Pledges has real substance .  \nI do not think it is established that the Individual Defendants knew and approved the \nform that each of them took, but I am satisfied that t he Share Pledges were not executed \nfor the benefit of lending to unconnected third parties.  I find it is likely that each of the \nShare Pledg ors was ultimately owned and/or controlled by each of the Individuals \nDefendants , both of whom  knew and approved the principle of executing  the Share \nPledges , because the scheme for Misappropriati on required some ostensibly credible \nsecurity . The most obvious way to give credibility to the security (and therefore to make \nthe Relevant Loans appear more genuine) was to agree , anyway in principle , that their \nassets could be used to create the appear ance that the security was genuine , even though \nthey did not intend the Share Pledges ever to be enforced.    \n734. Having weighed the evidence, and recognising that much of it is circumstantial,  I have \nnonetheless concluded that the Bank has establishe d that the individuals who are \nidentified in the structure charts as being the persons by or for whom the shares in each \nof the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers were ultimately or indirectly held, were \nbound to act in relation to those shares on the instructions of the Individual De fendants .  \nIn my judgment, there is a compelling case that, although the charts disclose that the \nshares of the relevant top company were held on trust for named individuals, those \nindividuals themselves exercised their rights as nominees for the Individual Defendants , \nwho therefore had control over the exercise of those rights . \n735. It follows that one of the major building blocks in the Bank’s claim that both of the \nIndividual Defendants were involved in the Misappropriation, and were the persons  for \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n183 \n whose ultimate benefit the Misappropriation was conducted has been established .  I \nalso consider it lik ely (and therefore proved on the balance of probabilities ) that the \nIndividual Defendants have always know n that this was the case , and that this important \naspect of their defence to these proceedings was therefore built on a deliberate lie.  \n \nOwnership and control of the Corporate Defendants  and the ED Principals  \n736. The Bank also alleges that the Corporate Defendants were, from January 2013 at the \nlatest, ultimately owned and /or controlled by the Individual Defendants . This has \nalways been denied by all of the Defendants (including the Corporate Defendants) .  The \nway that the scheme and the Misappropriation wor ked meant that the role of the \nCorporate Defendants was directed and  coordinated in a centralised manner, which \nitself implie d a centralised control.  This is obviously consistent with that control being \nexercise d by the Individual Defendants as the controllers of the Bank itself.  \n737.

When eventually disclosed, \nthe Individual Defendants’ cases on these important relationships , with the exception \nof the asserted UBOs of Rossyn and Milber t (and part of the time Ukrtransitservice), \nshow them to b e individuals  working for one of the Cypriot CSPs , details of which I \nhave given in paragraphs 291ff above.   That in itself makes them improbable candidates \nfor being UBOs  of companies participating in the scheme in the manner I have already \ndescribed.  As a matter of common sense they must have taken their instructions from \nelsewhere . \n738. The likelihood that the source of those instructions and control was one or both of the \nIndividual Defendants is apparent from a number of facts, the first of which related to \nthe identity of those who were said by the Individual Defendants to have fulfilled the \nrole of directors and nominee s in relation to the Corporate Defendants .  There was no \ndispute  as to their identity or as to the other connections they had with the Individual \nDefendants .  The only individual who was not identified as holdin g other a ssets or \nacting as a nominee director for other companies for the Individual Defendants was \nChara Kyriakou  who was a director and nominee shareholder of Rossyn with effect \nfrom 1 December 2014 .  As to the others, I can summarise the position as follows : \ni) Micha lakis  Tsitsekkos , who was a director of Teamtrend and the nominee \nshareholder of Teamtrend and Trade Point Agro , holds 17 other assets for Mr \nKolomoisky  with a cumulative value of US$397  million  and 13 other assets for \nMr Bogolyubov  with a cumulative value of US$53 million . \nii) Anna  Korelidou , who was also a director of Teamtrend , holds interests in five \nother assets for Mr Kolomoisky and nine assets f or Mr Bogolyubov . \niii) Mr Marangos , who was a director and nominee shareholder of Collyer , was \ninvolved in the incorporation of Primecap and was a l ong-standing associate of  \nboth Individual Defendants (as I have explained earlier in this judgment ).  \nTogether with Mr Anischenko, Mr Bogolyubov attended his wedding in Cyprus , \nat which Mr Novikov was the best man .  He was also a director of Sim Lim and \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n184 \n in that capacity provided corporate trustee service s to Mr Bogolyubov .  He also \nholds interests in eight Borrowers and one Intermediary Borrower . \niv) Giannakis  Savvidis , who took over as a director and nominee shareholder of \nCollyer from Mr Marangos, holds interests in four assets for Mr Kolomoisky  \nand 29 assets for  Mr Bogolyubov . \nv) Eleni  Constantinou , aka Eleni  Savvidou , who was a director of Ukrtransitservice  \nand a director and nominee shareholder of Rossyn , also acted as a  director  or \nsecretary of other companies  in which the Individual Defendants admitted to \nholding an interest  and appears in the Structure Charts of five Borrowers and \none Intermediary Borrower . \nvi) Christakis Konnaris, who was a director and nominee shareholder of Milbert, \nalso holds interests in eight assets for Mr Kolomoisky with a combined value of \nUS$204 million and six assets for Mr Bogolyubov with a combined value of \nc.US$53 million.  \nvii) Ms Thrasyvoulou , who was also a director of Ukrtransitservice, acted as the \nsecretary  or director of a number of companies  in which the Individual \nDefendants had an admitted interest . \n739.

This evidence simply demonstrates that the same Cypriot CSPs provided corporate \nservices (in the form of directors and nominee shareholders) to the Individual \nDefendant s as they did to  the UBOs of  the Corporate Defendant s.  It points to the \npossibility that the Corporate Defendants might have been owned or controlled by the \nIndividual Defendants, but does not in itself establish that was the case.  \n740. In their answers to the Bank’s requests for further information dated 27 March 2020  \nand 16 July  2021 , the Corporate Defendants pleaded the following details relating to \ntheir own UBOs .  For these purposes , the Corporate Defendants’ UBOs were described \nas “the persons with the power to control their respective companies, along with those \ncompanies’ directors”. For the period 2013 to 2016 , the UBOs of the English \nDefendants were all said to have been Mr Melnyk, Mr I Pugach, Mr Ivlev , Ms Yesipova \nand Ms Trykul ych, with Mr Melny k as the only UBO of Trade Point Agro up until 22 \nFebruary 2016.   The UBO of Rossyn was said to have been Andrey Romanovsky  and \nthe UBO of Milbert and Ukrtransitservice was said to have been Myk haylo Kiperman, \nsave that  from 30 March 2014  the interest Mr Kiperman  had held in Ukrtransitservice \nwas said to have been held for Ms Trykulych . \n741. All of these individuals featured  regularly in the evidence i n different capacities, and it \nwas the Bank’s case that they were not the true UBOs of the Corpo rate Defendants \nagainst whose name they were listed , anyway in the sense described in Yurov , but rather \nheld their beneficial interest s in each of the Cor porate Defendants for the benefit of the \nIndividual Defendants.  This was a credible starting position for the Bank to take based \nsimply on the fact that the real jobs of all of them , apart from Mr Rom anovsky and Mr \nKiperman , were simply as employees of PBC.  It is convenient to deal with the other \nconnections between the Individual Defendants and the purported UBOs of the English \nDefendants separately fr om those bet ween the Individual Defendants and the purported \nUBOs of the BVI Defendants.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n185 \n 742. As to the other  roles  of the individuals said to have been the UBOs of the English \nDefendants , the Bank drew attention to the following examples : \ni) Mr Melnyk featured regularly in the evidence, and I have referr ed to some of \nthose occasions earlier in this judgment.  He held 11 assets for Mr Kolomoisky \nworth c. US$183  million  and 19 assets for Mr Bogolyubov worth c. US$116m), \nall pursuant to oral agreements .  He ran PBC  and also featured as a purported \nbeneficial owner of 27 Borrowers and 11  (or possibly 12)  Intermediary \nBorrowers .  It is said that he has loaned the Corporate Defendants c. £1.3m for \ntheir legal fees in these proceedings.  \nii) Mr I Pugach  was a PBC employee featured as a purported  beneficial owner of \n15 Borrowers and 12 Intermediary Borrowers .  He replaced Mr Melnyk as the \npurported beneficial owner of Cristalmax (a Lafferty Spreadsheet s Company) \nfollowing the Rokoman e-mail.  He holds ten other assets for Mr Kolomoisky  \npursuant to oral agreements and 20 other assets for Mr Bogolyubov on similar \nterms.  \niii) Mr Ivlev was also a PBC employee who held corporate roles  in six companies \nin which the Individual Defendants  admit interests.  \niv) Ms Yesipova was another PBC employee and a purported beneficial owner of \none Borrower (Ribotto) and one Intermediary Borrower (Kinan).   In February \n2019, she gave instructions to Cy"}

In February \n2019, she gave instructions to Cypriot CSPs and Primecap for the sale of \ninterests in a different Borrower (Tekhspets) and a different Intermediary \nBorrower  (Autotradeinvest).  She holds four assets for Mr Kolomoisky pursuant \nto oral agreements and three assets for Mr Bogolyubov on similar terms.  \nv) Ms Trykulych  was a nother  PBC employee  and the  purported beneficial owner \nof 13 Borrowers , nine  Intermediary Borrowers  and one of the ED Principals \n(Hangli ).  She was also added as the new purported beneficial owner of one of \nthe Lafferty Spreadsheets Compan ies following the Rokoman e-mail.  She holds \nnine assets for Mr Kolomoisky pursuant to oral agreements and six assets for \nMr Bogolyubov pursuant to similar arrange ments . \n743. As to the other roles of individuals said to have been the UBOs of the BVI Defendants , \nMr Romanovsky , held out as  the UBO of Rossyn , was not an employee of PBC or one \nof the Cypriot UBOs .  However , the Bank demonstrated that he has had a close \nrelationship with the  Individual Defendants , representing their interests  in other \ncontexts , over the years.  Thus , he was appointed to the management of one of their \njoint assets, PJSC Eksimnaftoproduct in 2005, where he served as chair between 2006  \nand 2014 and was on the board until 2018. He has also made statements to the press as  \nthe representative of another  of the Individual Defendants’ c ompan ies, PJSC \nOdesnaftoproduct , and had an extension on t he Black . \n744. The Bank also pointed to a number of other specific matters which meant that it was  \nwholly improbable to suppose that Rossyn was ultimately owned by Mr Romanovsky .  \nThey included the fact s that he has not come forward to explain his ownership or how \nhe used Rossyn  and that Rossyn made an unsecured loan of €44m to Mr Kolomoisky’s \nsister , Larisa Chertok, which was outstanding in 2013 .  The Bank also pointed out that, \nas part of the process of reducing the Bank’s list of related parties in January 2016, \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n186 \n other members of the Bank’s compliance department e -mailed Mr Luchaninov with a \nproposal to remove Mr Romanovsky as beneficial owner of Rossyn, or alternatively \nreplace him as the chair of Eksimnaftoproduct.  In the event,  he remained in both \npositions  but the fact that the Bank thought it was able to make such a proposal and the \nway in which it was expressed indicated  that the members of that department \nappreciated that Mr Romanovsky was not the genuine beneficial owner of Rossyn.    \n745. Like Mr  Romanovsky, Mr Kiperman, who was held out as the UBO of Milbert and \n(until March 2014 ) as the UBO of Ukrtransitservice , was not an employee of PBC or \none of the Cypriot UBOs .  However, t here was evidenc e that he and his father Yuriy \nhave been business associates of the Individual Defendants  for decades. The summary \nof some of the connections set out in the relevant nominee chart shows that Mykhaylo \nKiperman has held a number of assets for both Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov \nand has had a number of corporate roles in a number of the companies they own .  They \nwere also  put forward as purported beneficial owners of Transferred Assets , an issue \nwhich I will come back later in this judgment.   It seems to have been commonplace for \nassets which were ultimately controlled by the Individual Defendants to have been held \nby members of the Kiperman family . \n746. One of the"}

It seems to have been commonplace for \nassets which were ultimately controlled by the Individual Defendants to have been held \nby members of the Kiperman family . \n746. One of the added and unexplained oddities in relation to the transfer of what was said \nto be the ultimate beneficial ownership of Ukrtransitservice from Mr Kiperman to Ms \nTryk ulych on 30 March 2014 is that there is no rationale for this to have been done and \nnone has been suggested .  It occurred during the period in which Relevant Drawdowns \nwere being made  and meant that the individual now said to be the UBO of \nUkrtransitservice  is simply an employee of PBC .  As I have already explained she h eld \nmany other nominee connections with the Individual Defe ndant s. \n747. There are a number of other miscellaneous indications that the Corporate Defendants \nare in reality what  the Bank  called in its opening submissions “ part of a stable of” the \nIndividual Defe ndants’ companies who, with the assistance of compliant CSPs, carry \nout instructions given to them  by the Individual Defendants.  If that is right, it would \nbe accurate to conclude that the Corporate Defendants were indeed controlled by the \nIndividual Defendants at the time of the Misappropriation.  They include the fact that \ndocumentation emerged which shows that Sofocleous was invoicing  Teamtrend and \nCollyer both f or attending meetings with Mr Kolomoisky and for “changing the records \nof 167 companies” which , absent any explanation, cannot all have been companies for \nwhich Teamtrend and Collyer were respo nsible.  Mr Kolomoisky never answered the \nBank’s request for an explanation.  \n748. The Bank also suggested that  indications of control by the Individual Defendants also \ninclu de what seems to have occurred in 2003, during the course of proceedings brought \nin England by Michael Shahar against Mr Tsitsekkos   and Ms  Korelidou , together with \na number of other defendants , alleging that they had unlawfully deprived him of his \nownership of Teamtrend and its  underlying subsidiaries,  which were  said to own a \nshopping centre in Dnipro  and a contract to run Dnipro airport .  Mr Kolomoisky , who \nwas not  himself a defendant , responded  by bringing a second action  together with \nSergei  Cheklanov seeking declarations that Mr Cheklanov was Teamtrend’s  beneficial \nowner.  Two points are said to arise. First, in the only available judgment, Man n J \nobserved that “it is not wholly clear why Mr Kolomoisky  is a party to this action since \nhe does not seem to claim any relie f”.  It is said that an understanding of Mr \nKolomoisky’s a sset holding structures, would explain why : if the action had gone \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n187 \n further, it would have become obvious that Mr Cheklanov was a nominee for Mr \nKolomoisky .  Second ly, there is evidence to the effect that at least one of the  assets \nsupposedly owned by Teamtrend at the time of the Shahar proceedings  (the example is \nthe ZUM referred to in paragraph [7] of Mann J ’s judgment) has ended up in the \ndeclared  ownership  of the Individual Defendants  (described in their respective asset \nlists as a 22.6% interest each in \"TDV TSUM\"  or just “TSUM” ). \n749. Another example of the use of the Corporate Defendants in a sim ilar manner related to \nthe Individual De fendants’  holding of 32.29% of their 94.18% interest in Botievo Grain \nReceiving Station through Collyer .

Mr Bogolyubov submitted that this does not \ndemonstrate control of Collyer itself.  However, this is but one example of a situation \nin which Collyer was being used by the Individual Defendants and Mr Bogolyubov in \nparticular as a vehicle through which real assets were being held on his behalf.  Taken \nalone, that may not prove control, but it remains a material part of the jigsaw.  \n750. The interest which Mr Kolomoisky showed in other legal proceedings to which the \nCorporate Defendants were party also reflected a probability that they were entities \nwhich he controlled.   As I explained in paragraph 527 above, at the end of  July 2016 , \nthe Perchesky District Court granted injunctions on the application of the GPO freezing \nthe Cyprus branch accounts of Trade Point Agro and the BVI Defendants  as part of a \ncriminal investigation into the Unreturned Payments .  Two weeks later, on 9 August \n2016, Mr Kolomoisky received a WhatsApp message from one of his associates, \nOleksandr Granovsky , which related to the  orders which Mr Kolomoisky might wish \nto have  revoked  and also explained that the GPO had applied for a further arrest order \nagainst Teamtre nd.  The Bank suggested that the reason that Mr Kolomoisky was \ninterested in this information and expressed no surprise that he had been informed , was \nthat he was and was known by Mr Granovsky to be the true UBO of the Corporate \nDefendants . \n751. The Bank also suggested that the true nature of the relationship between the Individual \nDefendants and the Corporate Defendants was apparent from the commencement and \nconduct of  Ukrainian  defamation proceedings in 2017.  It was said by the Bank that \nthese proceedings were commenced by the English Defendants in Ukraine , apparently \nin order to protect their reputation , but in reality i n an attempt to justify a lis alibi \npendens defence to any claim that might be commenced against the Corporate \nDefendants in E ngland .  There is plenty of evidence , which indicates that at the time \nthey did so the Defendants were aware that a claim against t hem in England was both \nlikely and immin ent. \n752. The Bank said that it was  absurd to suppose that the Corporate Defendants  themselves  \nhad any business reputation in Ukraine to defend ; they had already been the subject of \njudgments  in the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings holding them liable for US$1.8  billion, \nthey had taken no steps to protect their reputation in the aftermath of the NashiGroshi \nArticles in February 2015 and the Corporate Defendant s’ own evidence was that they  \ndid not currently engage in any active business trading .  These are all strong indica tors \nthat the English  Defendants were all acting on the instructions of the Individual \nDefendants in the commencement and conduct of these defamation proceedings  for \npurposes collateral to the protection of their own repudiations , an approach which was \nentirely consistent with the approach that the Corporate Defendants took to the defence \nof the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n188 \n 753. Finally I should add this.  I have already alluded to the  evidence that two Cyprio t \ncompanies, Sanderlyn  and Versala , have been being  used to fund the BVI Defendants’ \ndefence of these proceedings  (see paragraph 173 above).  There is no discernible \nindependent commercial reason for them to be funding the Corporate Defendants’ \ndefence in this way.

There is no discernible \nindependent commercial reason for them to be funding the Corporate Defendants’ \ndefence in this way.   As the Bank pointed out, they are not litigation funders by trade: \nVersala’s main business activities include “investing with holding of investments in the \nferroalloy, mining and processing and metal branches” while Sanderlyn trade s in oil \nand oil products .  However, such evidence as there is indicates that both those Cyprio t \ncompanies are ultimately owned and controlled by the Individual Defendants .  Thus, \nthe sole shareholder of Sanderlyn is Eftychia Xonofontos, who (according to the \nIndividual Defendants’ own assets lists) holds six assets for Mr Kolomoisky  and five \nassets for Mr Bogolyubov,  while t he sole shareholder of Versala is Margarita \nPapanikolau, who (according to the same source) holds Mr Kolomoisky’s  interest in an \nIsle of Man company, Helenium Ltd, and four assets for Mr Bogolyubov.   Furthermore, \nSanderlyn’s company secretary is Martineus Secretarial Services, of which Mr \nTsitsekkos  is the sole shareholder.   The inference I draw is that this funding has been \nadvanced in the interests of an d for the benefit of the same individual s who control \nSanderlyn, Versala and the Corporate D efendants.  \n754. I was referred during the course of closing submissions to a schedule of the sources \nused for payment of the Corporate Defendants’ legal costs of these proceedings.  As I \nunderstood it , the figures were not agreed, but nor was there a substantial dispute about \nits accuracy.  It showed that, for the  most part , the Corporate Defendants’ legal costs \nhave been paid by unsecured loans from those said to be the relevant Corporate \nDefendant’s UBOs (i.e., the employees of PBC (sometimes through  an entity called \nEmm ett Group LLC) ) or Mr Kiperman as the case may be.   It also disclosed the loans \nfrom Versala and Sanderlyn .  It was submitted on behalf of the Bank that it is obvious \nthat the PBC employees (Mr Melnyk, Mr I Pugach, Mr Ivlev, Ms Yesipova and Ms \nTrykulych ) were in no position to make the advances of several million pounds  said to \nhave been advanced by them and the loans must have come from elsewhere .  I think \nthat is plainly the case, illustrated by the salary  which  Mr Melnyk commanded  at \nSunaltezza when he was transferred after nationalisation .  As the former  head of  PBC  \nhe is likely to have been one of its highest paid employees , but his pay was  EUR 7,500 \nper month , which makes it absurd to suggest that he, let alone the other employees of \nPBC , might have been making loans in their own right .  The only candidates are said \nto be the Individual Defendants (o r their corporate vehicles).   In my view, the evidence \nestablishes th at this is likely to have been  the case . \n755. Many of the points relied on by the Bank would not in and of themselves prove its case \nthat the true UBOs of the Corporate Defendants are in fact the Individual Defendants , \nalthough they are all consistent with that being the case.   However , looked at together , \nand in the absence of any properly  evidenced explanation to the contrary from the \nIndividual Defendants themselves, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities  that the \nCorporate Defendants a re, and have been since the time of the original making of the \nrelevant loans , part of the Individual Defendants’ “stable” of corporate vehicles in the \nsense that they are ultimately  controlled by them, comply with their instruction and will \nonly participate in activity with approval , whether transaction specific or more general \nin form . \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n189 \n 756.

It is not possible to reach a certain conclu sion on the precise terms on which their \ninterests in the Corporate Defendants were held , whether as against the nominee \nshareholders or as between themselves. However, I am satisfied  that the involvement \nof the Corporate Defendants in the M isappropriation was ultimately carried out on the \ninstructions of and for the benefit of the Individual Defendants .  To suggest that what \noccurred may have bee n done on the instructions of PBC or senior employees of the \nBank wi thout the approval and consent of the Individual Defendants seems to me to be \nabsurd, and no other candidates have bee n suggested, let alone justified by any credible \nevidence.  \n757. It is also said by the Bank that the Individual Defendants owned and /or controlled the \nED Principals , pointing out that they were held through the Individual Defendants’  \nadmitted nominees , that the Individual Defendants  have long -standing connections with \nthem and that they were controlled via Prim ecap. \n758. The asserted UB O of Hangli was  Ms Trykulych, whose role I have described in relation \nto the Corporate Defendants .  As the Bank pointed out she was therefore simultaneously \nsaid to have been one of the purported UBOs  of Teamtrend  (and therefore one of the \n“persons with the power to  control” it) at the same time as she was also one of the \nalleged UBOs of  one of the  ED Principals.  This undermines the English Defendants’ \npleaded case that they  “have  no knowledge as to whether their Principals effected \nsupply of the goods or returned  prepayments under the Agency Supply Agreements and \ndo not admit that they did not” . \n759. The asserted UBO s of Brimmilton were Andriy Kolobkov and then Iuliia Lykhachova.  \nMr Kolob kov is a PBC employee who sat on the board of eight of the Individual \nDefendants’ companies and was a purported beneficial owner of 18 Borrowers and 8 \nIntermediary Borrowers . He was removed from the supervisory board of other of the \nIndividual Defendants’ companies  following the Luchaninov e-mail, and  was removed \nand replaced as the beneficial owner of two offshore companies following the Rokoman \ne-mail.   Ms Lykhachova  is a PBC employee who holds interests in two assets for Mr \nKolomoisky  pursuant to oral agreements .  She was removed as a director of Well Rise \nLLC in May 2015 following the Luchaninov e-mail.  \n760. The asserted UBO of Collard is Ms Ryazantseva , a PBC employee who holds assets for \nMr Kolomoisky  pursuant to oral agreements , has acted as a director of companies  \nowned by the Individual Defendants or in which they have an interest  and was a \npurported beneficial owner of 5 Borrowers and 5 Intermediary Borrowers . \n761. The ED Principals , like the Borrowers, the Intermediary Borrower s and the Corporate \nDefendants  were part of the loan recycling scheme  in the sense that their role was part \nof the process of concealing what was going on .  The five themes which the Bank relied \non as a summary of the connections between the Individual Defendants and the \nRelevant Entities (which I describe below) apply to them as much as they do  to the \nother Relevant Entities.  In my judgment, the Bank has also established that, at the \nrelevant  times, it is likely that the Individual Defendants owned and controlled the ED \nPrincipals.   \n \nOwnership and control of the New  Borrowers  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n190 \n 762.

I have explained the role of the New Borrowers in the course of describing the \nTransformation in paragraphs 536ff of this judgment.   It is apparent from much of that \nexplanation that the New Borrowers were introduced at the behest of Mr Kolomoisky, \nwith the knowledge and approval of Mr Bogolyubov , in an effort to persuade th e NBU \nthat by taking the New Loans  onto its books in replacement of (amongst other \nindebtedness) liabilities under the Relevant Loans, the  Bank’s capital position would \nbe improved.  The Bank also submitted that the Individual De fendants sought to use  the \nTransformation as an opportunity t o defer the repayment of the existing loans by eight \nto ten years (with first repayments of the New Lo ans falling due between 2024 and \n2026) and to enable the release of the existing security (inadequate though it was) over \nshares in their companies.  The Bank’s case is that it is plain that the New Borrowers \nare yet further vehicles which were owned and /or controlled by the Individual \nDefendants.  The Individual Defendants deny that is the case.  \n763. The starting point  for the Bank’s submission is that the Individual Defendants made \ncommitment s to the Bank in the letter dated about 5 October 2016 which I have \ndescribed in paragraph  538 above.  This committed to a transfer of the existing loans to \noperating companies whose source s of income were real and transparent and was \nrapidly followed by the NBU’s decision 323 -rsh/BT .  For the reasons I have already \ngiven , the development of this commitment as part of the Transformation was initiated \nby the Individual Defendants.  \n764. I agree with the Bank’s submission that it is not credible to suggest  that the Individual \nDefendants, as the Bank’s controlling shareholders  and the signatories to the 5 October \n2016 letter,  would n ot then have been intimately involved in the Transformation  of \nwhich the making of the New Loans by the New Borrowers was an essential part.  On \nany view , it was a huge undertaking, involving about two thirds of the Bank’s entire \ncorporate loan book  and the Individual Defendants must have known that there was a \nserious risk that the Bank would be declared insolvent if it failed to complete the  \nTransformation.  The plan , which was then adopted , purported to repay outs tanding \nloans owed by the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers, who m I have already \nconcluded were owned and controlled by the Individual Defendants.  It was then \nimplemented through BOK, which (as the Bank put it and I accept) was the part of the \nBank which arranged transactions for the benefit of the Individual Defendant s. \n765. These facts alone make it very likely that the New Borrowers were also controlled by \nthe Individual Defendants, all the more so in the absence of any alternative candidates \nfor individuals who might have been prepared to undertake (or provide corporate \nvehicles with assets of substance to undertake) the existing commitment s of, amongst \nothers, the Borrowers and the Intermediary Borrowers.  There is also other \ncontemporaneous evidence which suggests that was indeed the case.  \n766. Thus, b y November 2016 , EY had been told that, although the New Borrowers had no \nbusiness es of their own , they were “expected to take over the business from other \ncompanies “owned by the ultimate beneficial owners of the new borrowers”.

All of \nthose other companies were entities in which the Individual Defendants  admit to \nowning  substantial stakes .  EY was also told th at the  New Loans would be secured by \nmortgages over the assets of companies, the vast majority of which the Individual \nDefendants admit ted to having owned.   The Bank also submitted that there  would be \nno reason for the New Borrowers to repay the indebtedness of the  193 Borrowers, or to \ntake on massive debts to support the Bank’s efforts to improve its capitalisation , unless  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n191 \n they were related t o the Individual Defendants .  Neither of the Individual Defendants \nhas produced any evidence as to the identity of any other person  who was willing to \ntake over billions of UAH of debt owed by the Bank’s existing borrowers , including \nthe Borrowers  and the Intermediary Borrowers . \n767. The Bank also drew attention to the fact that, even taking the information provided by \nthe New Borrowers in support of their loan applications at face value, they manifestly \nlacked either the income or assets necessary to repay the New Loans.  There is no \ncredible reason why any putative borrower unconnected with, and not controlled by the \nIndividual Defendants would take that course.   Furthermore the formal steps that were \ntaken to arrange the New Loans were very  similar to the manner  in which  previous \nillegitimate lending , includ ing the agreement of the Relevant Loans , was put in  place .  \nI have already alluded to what the  SOFs demonstrate  in this context, but it is striking \nthat the New Loans were initiated by BOK , were  issued within one or two days of the \ndate on which the New Borrower purportedly applied  for its loan  and the paperwork \nshows  no genuine attempt to assess whether the New Borrower would be able to repay \nits New Loan , or could provide adequate collateral.  \n768. I have reached the clear conclusion that , like the Borrowers and Intermediary \nBorrowers , the New Borrowers were corporate vehicles in fact owned and controlled \nby the Individual Defe ndants.  I have also concluded that the  manner in which the \nTransformation was sought to be implemented was a wholly artificial exercise , which \njustified the conclusion of the NBU’s post -nationalisation inspection team that:  \n“the nature of the transactions performed and the inadequacy of the scope of \nactivity of new borrowers, which are generally newly created companies, testify to \nthe artificiality of the above and the fact that the  transformation does not actually \nreduce the Bank’s risks”.  \n \nBenefit to the  Individual  Defendants  \n769. It is the Bank’s case that, although it is not a necessary part of its claim under Article \n1166 to show that the Relevant Drawdowns ended up in the Individual Defendants’ \naccounts or companies, it is quite clear from the documents  not just that they knew and \napproved the Misappropriation, but also  that it was for their ultimate benefit.  It \nsubmitted that, in any event, benefit was relevant because it gives the lie to Mr \nBogolyubov’s case that he had no involvement in the Misappropriation and that the \nschem e, which he accepts occurred, was masterminded by Mr Dubilet without his \napproval and consent.

The Defendants took slightly different approaches to this part of the case with Mr \nBogolyubov asserting in opening that “[w]e’ve not heard a word about benefit”, while \nMr Howard took an alternative line in cross -examination directed at establishing the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n192 \n Limitation Defence .  He suggested to Ms Rozhkova that the awareness the Bank must \nhave gained as a result of reading the reports in Glavcom (see paragraphs 430ff above ) \ncould be summarised as follows: “it would not be difficult to conclude that this appeared \nto be … an arrangement whereby funds were being withdrawn for the benefit of Mr \nKolomoisky” and “it’s obvious that the Bank … would have claims against its \nsharehol ders for having transited the Bank’s money to their companies”.  \n771. What Mr Bogolyubov submitted was the absence of any real evidence of benefit was at \nthe heart of the way his case was presented in  closing submissions .  His argument \nconcentrated on demonstrating that there had been no misappropriation of the  Bank’s \nmonies and that the reality of what the Bank relied on was no more than one part of a \nloan recycling scheme , in respect of which the Bank had been unable to prove t hat it \nhad sustained any loss.   There are a number of difficulties with this submission, which \nI will explain in this section of the judgment, but one which is worth explaining at the \noutset is that (as will  appear) the burden of proving  that compensation in the full amount \nof the harm constituted by the Relevant Drawdown s can appropriately be reduced , lies \non the Defendants.   Mr Bogolyubov has chosen not to attend court to give evidence to  \nconfirm that he received no benefit from the loan recycling scheme , despite the fact that \nthere is no other obvious expla nation for  what he thought it was intended t o achieve . \n772. One example of benefit to the Individual Defendants flowed from the analysis adopted \nby Mr Davidson (Mr Kolomoisky’s expert forensic accountant).  In his reports he \nsought to show what happened to the Relevant  Drawdowns on what he called a Funds \nFlow basis , but concluded that he had been  unable to trace US$557  million  of the \nRelevant Drawdowns.   Mr Thompson (the Bank’s expert forensic accountant) then \ndemonstrated, using Mr Davidson’s methodology , that three of th ose Relevant \nDrawdowns could be traced to loan repayments by PJSC Zaporozhye Ferroalloys Plant \n(“ZFP”) , a substantial company in the Ferroalloy Holding  group  in which both of the \nIndividual Defendants held interests .  He also demonstrated that a UAH 157  million  \ndrawd own by Prominmet could be traced on the same Funds Flow basis to the \nIndividual Defendants or their corporate vehicles in that it was possible to trace:  \ni) US$653k to a payment by Grizal to Mr Bogolyubov’ s personal account under a \ncounter -financing agreement  dated 22 July 2013 (as I have already explained \nGrizal was a company wholly owned by Mr Bogolyubov); and  \nii) US$16.6  million  to a payment by High Wings  Aviation to an account of De \nGama GmbH at Deutsche Bank to purchase a Bombardier aircraft under an \n‘Aircraft Sale and"}

Although Mr Davidson confirmed during his cross -examination that he was content \nthat Mr Thompson’s analysis was correct, the Individual Defendants did not explain \ntheir receipt of these funds.  In oral closing submission s, Ms Montgomery said that Mr \nThompson had accepted in cross examination that he could see “no sign that Mr \nBogolyubov or Mr Kolomoisky got any part of those Unreturned Prepayments ”, but \nthat does not take matters very much further because it was never likely that  there would \nbe any record from a forensic accounting perspective of payments being made directly \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n193 \n to the Individual Defendants – on any view the flow of funds was much more complex \nthan that . \n774. In relation to the remainder of the US$557 million, which Mr Davidson had said was \npaid “into accounts where there is such a degree of mixing that any form of exact \nmatching becomes impossible”, the Bank attempted to make a further direct link, \nalthough in  the event it foundered.  Initially , Mr Davidson had accepted the following \nexample that was put to him in cross -examination.   It was suggested to him that the \ntransactional data showed that what was said to be a US$30 million Relevant \nDrawdown by Tekhspet s made on 26 June 2014 could be followed to Divot Enterprises \nLimited (“Divot”), a company the shares in which are held on trust for Mr Kolomoisky.  \nDivot then  made payments totalling US$195 million to Mr Bogolyubov’s company, \nGrizal, (between 27 July 2013 and 6 October 2016).  \n775. In the event this line of questioning was based on a false premise because, as Mr \nBogolyubov’s counsel explained in their written closing, the drawdown was not in fact \na Relevant Drawdown.   It follows that, although Mr Davidson accepted in cross -\nexamination: “although we can’t engage in Exact Matching, what we can say is that \nproceeds from the Relevant Drawdowns went to a company which itself was funding \none of the Second Defendant’s companie s”, the Bank cannot rely on the underlying \nexample which caused hi m to agree to what was put to him.  \n776. However, there was also evidence that it was well -known by employees of the Bank \nwithin BOK that funds being advanced under Relevant Loans were intended for the \nultimate benefit of the Individual Defendants’ companies.  This evidence included the \nrecording  in e-mails dating from December 2013 and January 2014 of a documented \nlink between a number of Borrowers and projects in which companies owned or \ncontrolled by the Individual Defendants were engaged.  The Bank made submissions \non several examples.  \n777. The first example was correspondence which demonstrated that there was a proposal \nfor Forsa Ltd LLC and Real -Standart to be the Borrowers for a project involving PJSC \nKyivguma, a company owned and controlled by the Individual Defendants.  \n778. The second was an initial proposal that Alfatrader and Mitsar (sometimes spelt Mizar) \nwere initially to be the borrowers of US$50 million each in relation to loans for the \nfunding of work at Hotel Split, a four star Radisson Blu hotel in Croatia, beneficially \nowned by Mr Bogolyubov.

The proposal then changed with Ortika LLC (“Ortika”) \nreplacing Alfatrader and Ribot to LLC (“Ribotto”) replacing Mitsar.  In the event, \nbetween 20 January 2014 and 27 February 2014, Ribotto drew down US$50m in \nRelevant Drawdowns  and made a prepayment in that amount to Wolcott Corporation \n(a non -relevant supplier) and between 17 January 2014 and 6 February 2014, Ortika \ndrew down US$50 million in Relevant Drawdowns and also made a prepayment in that \namount to Wolcott.  \n779. Confirmation of this proposal was given by Vyacheslav Vetluzhskikh , the Bank’s pre - \nand post -nationalisation head of internal audit in an e -mail he sent to Mr Yatsenko on \n8 April 2015 with a copy of a letter from PwC.  PwC had noted that the Bank was \n“involved in a project to fund the construction of a hotel in Croatia” (i.e., Hotel Split) \nand that “in 2014 the borrower raised financing by structuring the transaction using \nintermediary companies (Ortika, Ribotto and Prudis LLC (“Prudis”))”.  PwC said those \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n194 \n borrowers should be added to the related parties list prepared in accordance with IFRS, \nbut the important point for present purposes is that it confirmed the funding structure.   \nThis was then re -confirmed in an internal Bank presentation dated 30 June 2015, which \naddressed the financing of Hotel Split, including the construction of a new wing called \nthe Cane Bay Residence, identified the “Borrowers” as Ortika, Ribotto and Prudis and \ngave the outstanding balances on their loans.  \n780. The third example was an initial proposal that Milorin was to be the borrower of US$15 \nmillion in relation to work at the Shakhsky Dvorets building, aka the Shakh / Shah’s \nPalace, an administrative building in Odessa.  It appears in Mr Bogolyubov’s assets list \nand is held by Ukrinterinvest, which itself is admitted to be an asset owned by the \nIndividual Defendants.  The proposal then changed with Intorno LLC (“Intorno”) \nreplacing Milorin as the borrower.  In the event, between 14 February 2014 and 27 \nFebruar y 2014, Intorno drew down UAH 135 million (c.US$15 million) in Relevant \nDrawdowns and made a prepayment in that amount to Faberge.  \n781. In addition to these examples, there were many other references in the papers to \noccasions on which the Bank made advances to Borrowers which were then allocated \nin the Bank’s transaction data or otherwise identified as financing for the Individual \nDefenda nts’ other assets.  This became particularly apparent as the Bank came under \nincreasing pressure during the course of 2015 to be more transparent in relation to its \nidentification of related parties, one example of which was a memo from Mr Medvedev \nto Mr N ovikov in which he explained the need to add two of the Ukrainian Borrowers \n(Alfatrader and Milorin) and two of the Intermediary Borrowers (Vinibur LLC and \nLetara LLC) to the list of related parties for IFRS purposes on the grounds that they \nwere involved in the financing of ZFP.  In the event this did not occur, but there is no \nsuggestion that the underlying role of these entities was not accurately described.  \n782. Further confirmation of this borrowing structure was given in the Kazantsev \nSpreadsheet and the Gurieva Spreadsheet which allocated each of the Borrowers to a \nrecognisable industry sector in which the Individual Defendants were known to have \nassets.

Thus both the Kazantsev Spreadsheet and the Gurieva Spreadsheet allocated the \noriginal 46 Ukrainian Borrowers to one of a number of categories of asset class, all of \nwhich appear to relate to known assets of the Individual Defendants.  There is also \nevidence in  an e-mail sent by Maksym Leshchenko, the deputy head of client lending \nat BOK, to amongst others Mr Kazantsev on 26 January 2015, which appears to \nevidence that US$1.8 billion was outstanding in respect of loans to the Borrowers \n(which were also identifie d as being outstanding in the Gurieva Spreadsheet).  The \nBank submitted that it was striking that in that e -mail US$1.8 billion of the Borrowers’ \nthen outstanding indebtedness was ascribed to identifiable assets (such as ferroalloy, \ntanker projects, rubber  projects, PET trading, IMRP trading, aircraft trading, Kievguma, \nHotel Split and Bukovel) all of which were assets and projects in which the Individual \nDefendants had an interest.  \n783. It was said on behalf of Mr Bogolyubov that this correspondence does not have the \nevidential value which the Bank ascribes to it, and that these attributions were no more \nthan a reference to the labelling given to the Relevant Loans, in a form normally \nemployed to identify the area of business which was to be used as ostensibly legitimate \ncover, even though the lending in fact had no relationship to that business.  I do not \naccept that submission, more particularly in circumstances in which the Individual \nDefendants did not themselves give evidence to confirm that none of their businesses \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n195 \n received any benefits from the advances of the Relevant Loans, whether through a direct \nfunds flow  (whatever tracing methodology was used ), or otherwise.  \n784. The likelihood of benefit to the Individual Defendants’ own businesses is also \ncorroborated by the Bank’s financial statements, which confirm that the majority of its \nlending went to sectors in which the Individual Defendants had significant interests \nthrough other corporate vehicles.  The notes to the Bank’s 2014 financial statements \ncontain a detailed breakdown of the extent of its exposure to particular economic and \nbusiness sectors and it is possible to compare those to the Individual Defendants’ known \nbusiness interests, so that they fit within the relevant sector.  It was said by the Bank \nthat this correlation admitted of only two possibilities: either that the Bank was lending \nfor the ultimate benefit of the Individual Defendants’ own companies, or th at the Bank \nwas being used to fund the businesses of their rivals.  It was suggested (and I agree) \nthat, given the Individual Defendants’ controlling stake in the Bank,  the latter is absurd.  \nIt was also suggested (and I agree) that the former is borne out  by Ms Lozytzka’s \nevidence that BOK’s “strategic clients” were “companies and plants which fell within \nindustry sectors in which [the Individual Defendants] held business interests” (see \nparagraph 67 above).  \n785. In support of its case as to the correlation, the Bank also submitted that there was a \nstriking discrepancy between the scale of the lending to sectors in which the Individual \nDefendants had major holdings and the disclosed related party lending: it only \namounted to 11%, of the UAH 161 billion in corporate loans recorded in the 2014 \nfinancial statements.

The Bank’s auditors, PwC, eventually picked up on this point and \nelaborated on it in a memo (circulated by Mr Yatsenko to M r Novikov, Ms Gurieva and \nMr Du bilet on 21 June 2016) in which they referred to (a) the use of what they called \ntraders in particular business sectors (e.g., ferroalloy) which were acting as borrowers \nfor funding to the Individual Defendants’ entities and (b) the Bank’s failure to ident ify \nthe beneficial owners of those “traders” or to classify them as related parties.  \n786. The final matter on which the Bank relied in order to show a flow of benefit to the \nIndividual Defendants from the making of the Relevant Drawdowns relates to the \nLafferty Spreadsheets, the preparation and significance of which I have referred to in \nparagr aphs 130ff above.  It is said that they show that, according to the individuals who \nprepared them during the period immediately prior to the Defendants’ jurisdiction \nchallenge (and who were said to have personal knowledge of what occurred), at least \nUS$452m of the  Relevant Drawdowns went via “break points” to repay loans of \nferroalloy companies in which the Individual Defendants had admitted interests.  They \nalso depict chains of payments being made and received by some 55 companies that \nfeature in the Individual D efendants’ asset disclosure as having real value.  The Bank \nsubmitted that there could be no reason for the Individual Defendants to have directed \ntheir asset -holding companies to make and receive payments forming part of payment \nchains which display what  appeared to be “a money circulation scheme” (the way it \nwas described by Mr Bogolyubov’s expert forensic accountant) if they were not \nbenefitting from that scheme.  \n787. In closing, Mr Bogolyubov’s counsel submitted that the Bank’s reliance on the Lafferty \nSpreadsheets was incoherent.   They said that the Bank has rejected the Lafferty analysis \nas inaccurate (which is true) and that the transaction chains comprising the US$452 \nmillion said to have gone to the 55 companies were based on the Lafferty Spreadsheets’ \nuse of a ‘break point’ a nd a ‘compensation payment’ analysis which was a focus of \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n196 \n particular criticism by the Bank in its opening.  They also said that, in order to link \ndifferent payments to Grizal (and thus Mr Bogolyubov), the Bank relied upon what the \nLafferty Spreadsheets show only before the break point, on the basis that “nobody l ikes \nbreak points anymore”. They also submitted that the Bank’s position is unsustainable, \nnot just because it has disavowed the Lafferty analysis, but also because it is \ninconsistent with the Bank’s own methodology for following funds.  \n788. So far as it goes, Mr Bogolyubov is clearly right on this point.  In support of this \nparticular argument, the Bank relied upon the Lafferty Spreadsheets as showing that \nvarious Relevant Drawdowns made by Agroprom on various dates in May 2014 went \nvia Colly er and various other companies to Marganetskiy Mining and Processing Plant \nLLC and Ordzhonikidze Mining and Processing Plant LLC (two ferroalloy companies \nin which Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov each held an equal share in c.48% of the \nequity), which then  used them to make repayments to the Bank on the same dates as the \nRelevant Drawdowns were made.

It was then said that t he two analyses were mutually exclusive , and that t he same funds \ncould not be used both to repay loans by the ferroalloy companies in May  and July 2014 \nand also to make Unreturned Prepayment s in Aug ust 2014.  It was said that t he Bank \nmust choose a single case.   I do not think that this is an answer to the point made by the \nBank, which is that for some time it was accepted by the Defendants that a funds flow \nanalysis showed the proceeds of Relevant Drawdowns  ended up repaying loans of  \nferroalloy companies in which the Individual Defendants had admitted interests.  The \nfact that the flow of funds went in that manner might have been a relevant consideration \nif the Bank were to be pursuing a proprietary claim for recovery of the actual mo ney \npaid away at the time of the Relevant Drawdown.  But it is not; its claim is for \ncompensation for the harm it sustained as a result of the Individual Defendants’ \ncommission of unlawful acts and involves a causation analysis based on the Bank’s \nown tran sactional data.   \n790. Having regard to all of these considerations, I have reached the clear conclusion that it \nis likely that a major part of the Bank’s corporate loan book was ultimately made up of \nadvances to businesses controlled by the Individual Defendants (or in respect of which \nthey held a significant economic interest).  There is compelling evidence (apparent from \nelsewhere in  this judgment) that the Individual Defendants’ business model was to \nprocure loans from the Bank to a façade of shell companies, which then found  its way \nto fund their other businesses.   These shell companies were not declared as related \nparties so as to limit the Bank’s declared related party lending.  Even though much of \nthe lending was to shell companies, rather than to the underlying trading enterprises, \nthe Bank was able to classify the lending to the specific sectors in which the Individual \nDefendants had interests for the purposes of its financial statements.  \n791. The Bank submit ted, consistently with  evidence adduced from the Individual \nDefendants’ own expert, Mr Davidson,  that the manner in which the funds were \nchannelled to the Individual Defendants’ companies was so complex as to be \nimpossible to trace (and so it has been left in the type of jungle without a route -map \nthat was referred to by Toulson J in Komer cni Banka  AS v. Stone and Rolls Ltd  [2002] \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n197 \n EWHC 2263 (Comm) (“ Komercni ”) at [176]), which, so it is said, is one reason why it \nis not required to prove that the funds ultimately ended up with their companies.  \n792. I accept that submission.  If, in order to establish its claim, the Bank were required to \nprove that it could trace a particular Relevant Drawdown into the hands of one of the \nIndividual Defendants’ companies, its inability to do so because it would be ent ering a \njungle without a route -map would not relieve it from the legal obligation to prove its \ncase.

This is the case even though the \nprecise process by which that was achieved, remai ned in some material respect \nshrouded in mystery.   This is a point to which I will return when considering what has \nbeen called the use of f unds  defence and the bigger fraud argument later in this \njudgment.  \n \nConclusions as to the role of t he Defendants in the Misappropria tion \n793. The Bank identified five key  themes which they said appear ed from the detailed points \nmade in relation to the ownership and control of the Borrowers, the Intermediary \nBorrowers, the Corporate Defendants , the ED Principals  and the New Borrowers .  The \nfirst was that  the structure and nominee charts demonstrate how the same companies \nand nominees were being used time and again to hold interests in those e ntities .  Most \nof the individuals  concerned  were  PBC and former Bank employees who could  be \nlinked  to the I ndividual Defendants  in a variety of other ways: hold ing valuable assets \nfor them  under oral agreements (or arrangements arising through “conduct and \nimplication”) . The companies holding interest s in the Borrowers , Intermediary \nBorrowers, Corporate Defendants and ED Principals  regularly  appear in the structures \nholding assets admitted to belong to the  Individual Defendants . \n794. The Bank’s second theme was that , during 2015, there was a concerted effort to conceal \nthe Individual Defendants’  connections with many of the Borrowers. It went on within \nthe Bank (which was of course owned and controlled by the Individual Defendants) and \nwas implemented by the employees with whom they had the close st relationships, in \nparticular Mr Yatsenko, Ms Gurieva and Mr Novikov.   The complex process of \nremoving those links in order to fool the NBU involved mass changes of company \ndirectorships and p urported beneficial ownership, as evidenced by the Luchaninov e -\nmail and the Rokoman spreadsheet .  The secretive way in which this was done was \nillustrated by the use of the Beneficiary Key cypher to conceal the identities of the \npurported UBOs and its artificiality was illustrated by the  advice from Avellum (e.g. to \nconsider the acquisition of 100 companies “by one or several beneficiaries on the same \nday”).  \n795. The Bank’s third theme was that  the Borrowers and when the time came the \nIntermediary Borrowers were all treated alike – they had the same kind of loans granted \nafter the same type of desultory approval process, near identical RSAs  and concluding \nwith the same involvement in the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings.   Furthermore when the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n198 \n time came, the borrowing of the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers was said by \nthe Defendants to have been discharged in the same three ways  (i.e., the Cash \nRepayments, the Asset Transfers and the New Loans which I introduced at the \nbeginning of this judgment) . The Bank says that it is not realistic to suggest that these \ncompanies were in separate beneficial ownership s. \n796. The fourth theme is that, after some pressure, the Individual Defendants  have been \nforced to admit majority interests in four Borrowers (Alfatrader,  Uniks,"}
{"start": 745500, "text": "Intermediary Borrowers was said by \nthe Defendants to have been discharged in the same three ways  (i.e., the Cash \nRepayments, the Asset Transfers and the New Loans which I introduced at the \nbeginning of this judgment) . The Bank says that it is not realistic to suggest that these \ncompanies were in separate beneficial ownership s. \n796. The fourth theme is that, after some pressure, the Individual Defendants  have been \nforced to admit majority interests in four Borrowers (Alfatrader,  Uniks, Dorteks and \nPrado). It asks why did these four companies borrow US$99  million and  UAH  1.6bn \nfrom the Bank in the same way as all the other Borrowers if the other Borrowers were \nnot also owned by the Individual Defendants ?  And why did they make Unreturned \nPrepayments in the same way as all the other Borrowers? It is said that  the Individual \nDefendants’  refusal to attend for cross -examination shows that they are unable to \nanswer  those critical questions . \n797. The Bank then conclude d by submitting that the Individual Defendants’ case that they \ndo not own the Corporate Defendants is “in tatters”.  It s ays that those said to be the  \nUBOs of the Corporate Defendants  – such as Mr Melnyk – are all individuals with \nwhom the Individual Defendants  have close links  and they rely on what they describe \nas a damning body of evidence which has slowly been extracted from Individual \nDefendants .  This includes in particula r two of three English Defendants (Teamtrend \nand Collyer) being billed for meetings that Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Novikov had with \nSofocleous in the two months after the WFO was served  and work also carried out by \nSofocleous  in “changing the records of 167 companies” , which can only  have  been a \nreference to companies in the Individual Defendants’ “ stable ”.  It also includes the \nEnglish Defendants ’ institut ion of  defamation proceedings  for the benefit  of the \nIndividual Defendants , despite being judgment debtors to the tune of US$1.8bn, with \nno business reputation to protect and no assets , and Mr Kolomoisky’s reluctant \ndisclos ure of  WhatsApp messages showing that he controlled Sanderlyn and Versala, \nwhich have spent c.£1.5 million in funding the BVI Defendant s’ defence . \n798. I should add that  there is no evidence to substantiate any s uggestion that people other \nthan the Individual Defendants were responsible for devising and authorising what \noccurred.  They controlled the Bank and each of the Relevant Entities.  In those \ncircumstances, not only is it unevidenced, but it is also highly implausible , that \nemployees of the Bank, from Mr Dubilet downwards, would have embarked on the \nelaborate process of using a network of companies owned or controlled by the \nIndividual Defendants, a nd large quantities of sham documentation  in orde r to evidence \nso many sham loans, unless it was being done with the knowledge and approval of both \nof them.  \n799. Taken in isolation, much of what I have described about the nature and extent of the \ncontrol exercise d by Mr Kolo moisky and Mr Bogolyubov over the affairs not just of \nthe Bank, but also of the other Relevant Entities , is capable of being read both ways.  \nHowever, that would be to adopt too compartmentalised an approach to the evidence, \nwhich must be assessed in the round.  Stepping back, this is not a case in which there is \na single document or series of documents which establish the Bank’s case as to the \nIndividual Defendants ’ role in the Misappropriation, but nor is it surprising that such a \ndocument does not exist.  As I explained earlier in  this judgment , both of the Individual \nDefendants (and particularly Mr Kolomoisky) were accustomed to communicating \nother than by e -mail and in a manner for which no written record exists.

There are \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n199 \n examples of instances in which documentation has been destroyed and I continue to \nhave concerns that  not everything of relevance has in fact been disclosed.  This provides \nan answer to the Defendants’ submissions that the Bank’s case is much weakened by \nthe piecemeal nature of the documentation on which it relies.   In short, the evidence \nthat the Bank has been  able to adduce is very much more compelling when looked at it \nin the round than it would be when considering its component parts.   \n800. I accept the five key theme s identified by the Bank .  I have concluded that there is \noverwhelming circumstantial evidence that the Individual Defendants knew and \napproved of the scheme which led to the making of the Relevant Drawdowns pursuant \nto the Relevant Loans and the onward transmission of the monies to the Corporate \nDefendants .  It is not possible to say that each of the individual Relevant Drawdowns \nwas made on the specific instructions of the Individual Defendants, but I  am satisfied \nthat the Relev ant Loans would not have been advance d without their knowledge and \napproval and that it is likely  that each of the Relevant Drawdowns was made in \naccordance with at least a general  instruction  that it would be utilised in accordance \nwith the loan recycling structure which was at the heart of the Misappropriation .  This \nincluded making the Unreturned Prepayments to the Corporate Defendants.  \n801.  I am also satisfied that the Bank has established its case on benefit  to the Individual \nDefendants .  In my judgment, the total impact of t he evidence is corroborative of the \nBank’s case that the funds originally misappropriated by the making of the Relevant \nDrawdowns (and which were then used either directly or indirectly to fund the \nUnreturned  Prepayments) benefitted the Individual Defendants and/or their trading \nbusinesses.  It is likely that the ability to use (whether directly or indirectly) the proceed s \nof US$ prepayments made under Supply Agreements in this way was the whole purpose \nof the loan recycling scheme in the first place , and the fact that the forensic accountants \nhave not been able to identify exactly how and to whom they were siph oned off (to use \nGlavcom’s phrase) after the prepayments had been made does not mean that it did not \nhappen.  \n802. Furthermore, the fact that the scheme was operated through artificial and sham \ntransactions which had no intrinsic commercial purposes so far as the shell -company \nparticipants themselves were concerned, together with the highly complex fund flows \nwhich for med part of the scheme, shows that it was all built on dishonest foundations.   \nIt makes it much more  likely that the whole edifice  was designed to ensure that the \nultimate indirect beneficiaries of the monies transferred out of Ukraine as a result of the \nMisappropriation could not easily be identified.  \n \nForeign Law : General  \n803. It is common ground that the claims in tort for the loss the Bank alleges it suffered as a \nresult of the Relevant Drawdowns are governed by Ukrainian law.   There was no \nmaterial dispute as to the  approach that an English court adopts to determining any \nmatter of foreign law .  The essential principles are  now summarised in Dicey, Morris \n& Collins on the Conflict of Laws, 1 6th edn (“Dicey”) at paragraph s 3-011 and 3 -012: \n“Foreign law should, in general, be proved by  expert evidence .

The traditional view \nwas that foreign law could not be proved merely by putting the text of a foreign \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n200 \n enactment before the court, nor merely by citing foreign decisions or books of \nauthority , and that such materials could only be brought before the court as part of \nthe evidence of an expert witness , since wi thout the assistance of the expert  the \ncourt cannot evaluate or interpret them. This may be especially important when the \nforeign law in question is found in a number of sources whose relationship to each \nother is not easily understood or explained  … \n“But in  Brownlie  v. FS Cairo (Nile Plaza) LLC  [2021 ] UKSC 45, it was said \n(obiter) that the notion that foreign legal materials can only ever be brought before \nthe court as part of the  evidence of an expert witness  is outdated. Whether the court \nwill require evidence from an expert witness should  depend on the nature of the \nissue and of the relevant foreign law; when so much information is readily available \nthrough the internet, there may be no need to consult a foreign lawyer in order to \nfind the text of a  relevant foreign law; on some occasions the text may require \nskilled exegesis of a kind which only a lawye r expert i n the foreign system of law \ncan provide; but in other cases it may be sufficient to know what the text says. ” \n804. In carry ing out the exercise of determining the applicable principles of any foreign law , \nthe court is concerned with deciding  the law which a properl y directed court of the \nrelevant jurisdiction  (in this case Ukraine) would apply.   In Yurov , Bryan J explained \nwhat this meant when seeking to establish the applicable  principles of Russian law , as \nto which similar principles would be applied  in relation to the law of Ukraine:  \n“In that regard existing foreign judgments are to be given due weight and \nconsideration. I bear in mind that under Russian law judgments of lower courts are \nnot formal sources of law in the same way as they are in England. When \nconsidering the Russian decis ions, I have also had regard to the legislative \nframework and wider constitutional background in which they sit. ” \n805. The parties did not agree on the law applicable to the Bank’s claim against the \nCorporate Defendants in unjust enrichment. The Bank contended that the applicable \nlaw was the law of Ukraine, being the place to which the unjust enrichment it alleged \nhad the closest connection. The Corporate Defendants contended that the applicable \nlaw was the law of Cyprus, being the place in which they were said to have been \nenriched by the monies representing the Unreturned Prepayments.  There were said to \nbe material diffe rences between the law of Ukraine and the law of Cyprus.  I will \naddress that issue later in this part of the judgment.  \n \nForeign Law: the Experts  \n806. The parties called four experts for the purpose of assisting the court in its determination \nof the applicable principles.  Their evidence covered many issues which were not in the \nevent in dispute, and many the relevance of which either always were or beca me \ntangential to the matters which I need to decide.  \n807. The Bank’s Ukrainian law expert was Mr Oleh Beketov, a lawyer admitted to the Bar \nin Ukraine in 2009 and a partner and head of the International Litigation Practice at \nEterna Law, based in Kyiv.  He gave evidence on the Ukrainian law of tort and unjust \nenrichment . \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n201 \n 8"}

He gave evidence on the Ukrainian law of tort and unjust \nenrichment . \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n201 \n 808. I agree with the Bank’s submission that Mr Beketov was an honest , independent and \ndiligent expert  who did his best to assist the court.   I have had  to scrutinise t he way he \naddressed some of the issues on which he was cross -examined with considerable care, \nbecause there were aspects of his evidence which were not very well expressed, and \nthere were occasions on which he lost the thread of the issues he was being asked to \naddress .  However, in the end I have been able to reach clear conclusion s on the \nsubstance of his opinions, and for the most part accept his evidence as to the applicable \nprinciples of Ukrainian law on which he gave his view . \n809. Mr Kolomoisky’s Ukrainian law expert was Mr Oleg Alyoshin, a lawyer admitted to \npractice as an attorney -at-law in Ukraine in 1995 and a partner and head of the \nInternational Arbitration and Litigation practice group at Vasil Kisil & Partners, based \nin Kyiv.  \n810. I was not assisted by Mr Alyoshin’s  evidence to the same extent  as the evidence of Mr \nBeketov .  There were a number of reasons for this , but in large part they boiled down \nto the fact that he found it difficult to honour  his duty to assist the court when faced \nwith the need to make concessions which were liable to damage M r Kolomoisky’s case .  \nSometimes this was apparent from unreasonable intransigence and on other occasions \nthis was apparent from  fairly obvious evasiveness in no t addressing the issue about  \nwhich he was being asked.   One of the more  revealing example s of this attitude came \nin an exchange with Mr Andrew Hunter  KC, who was cross -examining him on behalf \nof the Bank  about the resolution  of the Supreme Court in  case No. 910/11033/18,  \nKakhova Prom -Agro LLC  v. PJSC Misto Bank  (“Kakhova ”), a case concerned with the \nquestion of whether it was open to a Ukrainian court to conclude that the parties to the \nRelevant Loans intended to breach public policy in the absence of a criminal conviction .  \nMr Hunt er was trying to  ascertain whether he knew about the decision when he \nexpressed a contrary view in his report without referring to the case.   When asked \nwhether it was his duty to bring the decision  to the attention of the court  if he had been \naware of it, he said that he did not know.  \n811. There were also two other aspects of his evidence, to which Mr Hunter drew attention \nin his closing submissions and which in my view had a material impact on the quality  \nand credibility of what he had to say .  The first was that there were a number of \noccasions, with which I will deal later in this judgment , on which Mr Alyoshin  \nmisrepresented the substance and effect  of other opinions  on which he relied in support \nof his evidence . Sometimes this amounted to the suppression of parts of academic  \narticles which were inconsist ent and even directly contradicted  the views which he said \nthe authors had  espoused.   On other occasions (such as his view on a significant aspect \nof the L imitation Defence ) he sup pressed his own earlier opinions given in other \ncontexts.  \n812. The second was that his independence was undermined by the existence of a  \nlongstanding relationship between his firm (and himself) and Mr Kolomoisky  dating \nback to 2013 .  This involved advice  in relation to other legal disputes  as well as to \nadvice in relation to these proceedings .

This involved advice  in relation to other legal disputes  as well as to \nadvice in relation to these proceedings .  The Bank did not try to explore  the nature and \nextent of the advice given by Mr Alyoshin in cross -examination, but he disclosed in his \nfirst report that he had been provid ing advice to both Mr Kolomoisky and Mr \nBogolyubov in relatio n to the Ukrainian law issue s arising out of these proceedings  \nuntil the time he was first instructed as an expert , which according to his letter of \ninstruction took place in November 202 1.  It transpired during his cross -examination \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n202 \n that this wa s a period of about two years because he was first instructed in October \n2019 . \n813. Mr Bogolyubov’s Ukrainian law expert was Mr Dmytro Marchukov, a lawyer who has \npractised law in Ukraine for 16 years and is a partner and head of Cross -Border \nLitigation at Integrites, based in Kyiv.   His evidence was limited to issues relating to \nArticle 1190 of the Civil Code  (“Article 1190”) , and the Bank was careful to eschew \nany allegation that he was disingenuous in the way he gave it.  I agree that he was an \nhonest and straightforward witness who did his best to assist the court.  \n814. The Corporate Defendants’ Ukrainian law expert was Mr Volodym yr Nahnybida, a \nlawyer with 17 years’ experience  in practice and head of the Scientific Laboratory for \nthe Problems of Adaptation of Ukrainian Legislation to EU Law at the Scientific \nResearch Institute of Private Law and Entrepreneurship.  He is also Professor of the \nDepartment of Civil Law and Procedure at Khmelnytskyi University of Management \nand Law and practises as Managing Partner of Genuine Law Company, based in \nKhmelnytskyi.  \n815. Ther e were occasions on which he, like Mr Alyoshin, was over -argumentative in the \nway he gave his evidence .  As a result, I  have found it necessary to approach what he \nhad to say with some caution , although (as will appear) there were aspects of his \nevidence which were of real assistance  to the court.  \n \nUkrainian Law : general  \n816. One of the areas on which the experts were largely but not wholly agreed related to the \nsources of Ukrainian law and the approach which Ukrainian law takes to the hierarchy \nof judicial decisions.  This is of particular relevance on the question s of whether a \nprovision of the constitution has direct effect, and the weight to be attributed to \ndecisions of the Supreme Court, which is Ukraine’s highest court, and decisions of the \nGrand Chamber of the Supreme Court.  A short summary of the position wi ll help to \nset in context the conclusions I have reached on such of the Ukrainian law issues and \ntheir application as remain in dispute between the parties.  \n817. Ukraine is a civil law jurisdiction and has a codified system of law, the main legislative \nsources of which are the constitution, international treaties such as the ECHR (which \nhave direct effect pursuant to Article 9 of the constitution) and the laws of U kraine \nenacted by the Verkhovna Rada.  Regulations adopted by the NBU are also binding in \nlaw on the banks to which they apply, in the same way that the decisions and regulations \nof other regulatory bodies are binding on the persons who are subject to thei r regulation.  \nThere was a difference of view between the experts on how a Ukrainian court would \nresolve any conflict between provisions of the Civil Code and provisions of the \nUkrainian Commercial Code (which govern s relations associated with business \nactivities) .

In the event, no issue has arisen in respect of which it is necessary to resolve \nthose differences.  \n818. Ukrain e now has a single court of cassation , the Supreme Court , which is divided into \nfour chambers (civil, commercial, administrative and criminal).  Like the decisions of \nthe Constitutional Court, the function of which is to resolve  the constitutionalit y of laws \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n203 \n and other legal acts, the decisions of the Supreme Court are regarded as sources of law \nin Ukraine: thus the lower courts must take into account judgments of the Supreme \nCourt as to how the law is to be applied.  The Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court is \ncharged with the task of en suring uniformity of practice between the other four \nchambers, and it is agreed by all experts who gave evidence on the point that its \njudgments carry more weight than those of the other chambers.  \n819. Nearly all of the decisions on which the experts relied were judgments of the Supreme \nCour t (called “resolutions” in most of the tra nslations with which I was provided) .  \nHowever, the decisions of the lower appellate courts (and even those of the courts of \nfirst instance) are of some persuasive weight in determining how the law of Ukraine \nwould approach a particular issue where there is no published practice of the highe r \ncourts on the point.  \n820. There was a difference of view between the experts on the question of whether \njudgment s of the Supreme Court are not just a source of law but are actually binding on \nthe lower courts.  The view of Mr Aly oshin and Mr Nahnyb ida is that they are (as if the \ndoctrine of stare decisis  were to apply) with the consequence that a failure to follow \nthem will result in a judgment  of those lower courts being set aside on appeal.  The \nview of Mr Beketov was that  judgments  of the Supreme Court need only be taken into \naccount by the lower courts and are only of persuasive authority to the same extent as \ndecisions of the lower courts of appeal.  He said that this flowed from the fact that there \nis no system of binding judicial precedent in Ukraine.  \n821. I do not think it is necessary to resolve this particular dispute.  While there were some \ndecisions in respect of which the views of the experts differed as to what the court \nactually decided, there is no recent decision of the Supreme Court which was said  by \nany of the experts to be a decision which , if properly understood,  did not reflect the law.  \n \nUkrainian law: Article 1166  and the elements of the cause of action  \n822. The Bank’s claim in tort is based on Article  1166, which is as follows:  \n“General grounds for liability for property damage  \n1. Property harm caused by unlawful decisions, actions or omissions to the personal \nnon-property rights of a natural or legal person, as well as harm caused to the \nproperty of a natural or legal person, shall be compensated in full by the person \nwho caused  the harm.  \n2. The person who caused the harm shall be exempt from paying compensation for \nthe harm if he proves that the harm was caused not through his fault.  \n3. Any damage caused by any severe injury or any other personal injury or death \nof an individual as a result of acts of God must be compensated to the extent \nprovided by law.  \n4.

At paras [67] and [68] of the resolution  of the \nSupreme Court in  case No. 910/12930/18 , Daniel  Commercial Bank PJSC  (“Bank \nDaniel ”), the way that this was explained was as follows:  \n“67. In resolving a dispute over damages, the court must establish the presence or \nabsence of a civil tort containing the following elements:  \n- unlawfulness of the person ’s conduct, that is, non -compliance with the \nrequirements set in applicable civil law acts;  \n- a fact of harm meaning a loss of or damage caused to the property of the victim \nand (or) deprivation of the victim of the personal intangible right; in general, any \nimpairment of a benefit that is protected by law, and the extent thereof;  \n- the causal link between the unlawful conduct and the harm, meaning that the harm \nmust be an objective consequence of the unlawful conduct, that is, the unlawful \nconduct of a particular individual (individuals), who is held liable, is that direct \nreason t hat inevitably caused the harm;  \n- fault of the tortfeasor.  \n68. If at least one of these elements is not in place, the civil liability shall not arise.”  \n824. It was common ground that the burden is on a claimant to prove the first three elements \nof the cause  of action, but the burden is on a defendant to disprove fault in the event \nthat those first three elements are established against him (para [71] of Bank Daniel ). \n \nArticle 1166 : Unlawful  Conduct  \n825. The concept of unlawfulness is given a wide interpretation for the purposes of Article \n1166.  In the joint statement, Mr Beketov and Mr Alyoshin agreed that conduct will be \nunlawful for the purposes of Article  1166 if it breaches “any provision of the Ukrainian \nConstitution, laws (statutes), international treaties, executive orders, regulatory \ninstruments or court judgments, that is directly applicable to the defendant and \nexpressly or implicitly prohibits the alleged conduct”.  The issue expressed in such \ngeneral terms was not addressed by Mr Marchukov.  Mr Nahnybida’s evidence is \nconsistent with th e description  given by Mr Beketov and Mr Alyoshin : he relied on a \nresolution of the Supreme Court dated 19 October 2021  in case No. 910/15931/19 , \nCentre Retail LLC  (“Centre Retail ”) at [10.13] , which expressed unlawfulness as \nfollows : \n“A person's unlawful conduct can be manifested in illegal decision making or \nmisconduct (actions or omissions). Unlawful in civil law is behaviour which \nviolates the mandatory rules of law or legally sanctioned terms of the contract, \nresulting in violation of the rights of another person ”.   \n826. The evidence establishes that th ese description s of unlawfulness are  the right starting \npoint for identifying whether the conduct alleged  is unlawful  for the purposes of Article \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n205 \n 1166 .  In particular , the touchstones are whether the prohibition said to have been \nbreached is a mandatory rule and whether (either express ly or implicit ly) it is directly \napplicable to the defendant.  \n827. It was also common ground that both acts and omissions to act are capable of \nconstituting  unlawful conduct.  This was specifically identified as"}

In particular , the touchstones are whether the prohibition said to have been \nbreached is a mandatory rule and whether (either express ly or implicit ly) it is directly \napplicable to the defendant.  \n827. It was also common ground that both acts and omissions to act are capable of \nconstituting  unlawful conduct.  This was specifically identified as part of the test for \nunlawfulness in Centre Retail  and confirmed in the resolution  of the Grand Chamber \nof the Supreme Court in case No. 910/11027/18 , DGF  v. Person 1 - 18 (“Ukoopspilka ”) \nat [7.74].  In the context of explaining that the members of the supervisory board and \nthe executive body of the bank in that case (JSB Ukoopspilka) were jointly responsible \nfor the activities of the bank as a whole, the Supreme Court said:  \n“The unlawfulness of their behaviour may consist of both committing certain \nactions and not committing them, i.e., inaction.”.  \n828. There are two categories of unlawfulness on  which the Bank  relies.  The first category \nis breaches  by Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov of the fiduciary duties they owed \nto the Bank.  They owed those duties as officers of a joint stock company under Article \n63 of the Law of Ukraine on Joint  Stock Companies ( “Article 63” and the “JSC Law”  \nrespectively ) and as executives of a bank under Article 42 and Article 43 of the Law on \nBanks  (“Article 42” and “Article 43” respectively”) .  The Bank also relied on breaches  \nof Article 92 of the Civil Code  (“Article 92”) .  It was common ground between the \nexperts that any breach of these provisions would amount to unlawful conduct for the \npurpose of a claim under Article  1166.   \n829. The second category of unlawfulness  identified in Mr Beketov’s evidence  was acts and \nomission s in breach of Article 3(1)(2)  and Article 13 of the Civil Code (“Article \n3(1)(2)” and “Article 13” respectively) - conduct which violate s the rights of another \nperson,  or which involve s an abusive exercise of the defendant’ s own rights .   There \nwas no common ground  on this issue , and in particular  it was disputed  that these articles \ncould found a claim  in tort .  It was said by the Corporate Defendants that , because the \nBank’s claim against them only relied on Articles 3(1)(2), 13(2) and 13(3),  the conduct \nalleged against them was not in  breach of a ny mandatory  rule of direct application \ncapable of amounting to unlawful ness for the purposes of Article 1166.   \n \nUnlawful conduct: breach of the fiduciary duties  \n830. The relevant parts of Article  63, Article  42, Article 43 and Article  92, dealing both with \nthe underlying duty and the consequences of its breach, are as follows:  \n“Article 63. Liability of officers of a joint stock company’s bodies  \n1. Officers of a joint stock company’s bodies shall act in the interests of the \ncompany, follow the requirements of the law, provisions of the charter and other \ndocuments of the company.  \n2. Officers of a joint stock company’s bodies are liable to the company for losses \ncaused to the company by their actions (omissions) in accordance with the law.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n206 \n 3. In the event that several persons are liable in accordance with this article, their \nliability to the company shall be joint and several. ” \n“Article 42.  \nThe executives of a bank are obligated to act in the bank’s interests and to observe \nthe requirements of the law, the provisions of the bank’s charter and other \ndocuments of the bank. ” \n“Article 43.

{"start": 773500, "text": "int and several. ” \n“Article 42.  \nThe executives of a bank are obligated to act in the bank’s interests and to observe \nthe requirements of the law, the provisions of the bank’s charter and other \ndocuments of the bank. ” \n“Article 43. Duty to protect the bank’s interests  \nThe executives of a bank are obligated to act for the benefit of the bank and its \nclients and are obligated to place the interests of the bank above their own when \nperforming their obligations in accordance with the requirements of this Law.  \nIn particular, the bank’s executives are required:  \n1) to behave responsibly when performing the duties of their office;  \n2) to take decisions within the bounds of the powers given to them;  \n3) to refrain from using their office in their personal interests;  \n4) to secure the integrity and transfer of the bank’s property and documents when \ndirectors are dismissed from their office. ” \n“Article 92. Civil capacity of a legal entity  \n1. …  \n2. …  \n3. A body or person who according to the constitutional documents of the legal \nentity or the law acts in the name of the legal entity is obligated to act in the interests \nof the legal entity in good faith and reasonably and not exceed its authority. \nRestri ctions on the representation of a legal entity shall not apply to its relations \nwith third parties, unless the legal entity proves that a third party knew or, in all the \ncircumstances, could not have been unaware of such restrictions.  \n4.  If the members of a body of a legal entity or other persons who, according to \nthe law or constitutional documents act in the name of the legal entity, breach their \nobligations concerning their representation, they shall be jointly and severally \nliable for losses that they cause to the legal entity.”  \n831. Mr Beketov explained in his evidence that these duties are complementary and in some \nrespects are mirror images of each other.  Taken collectively, they are often referred to \nin the Ukrainian banking and legal communities as fiduciary duties, although they  are \nnot formally defined as such under Ukrainian law.  In support of this way of \ncharacterising the duties, the Bank relied on paras [77ff] of the resolution of the \nSupreme Court  in Bank Daniel  in which the duties arising under Article  92 and Article  \n63 were described as follows:  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n207 \n “77. The above statutory provisions provide for the obligations of the legal entity's \nbodies (officials) to act in the best interests of the legal entity in good faith, \nreasonably and without abusing their powers and also provide for their liability for \nbreach of the obligations (fiduciary duties). ” \n832. It is clear from the succeeding paragraphs of the Supreme Court’s resolution  in Bank \nDaniel  that, by the concept of a fiduciary duty, it meant those duties recognised by the \nOECD Principles of Corporate Governance, as the basic fiduciary duties of directors of \ncompanies:  \n“a duty of care (acting in good faith, with due diligence and care, and in the best \ninterest of the company, devoting sufficient time, efforts and professional skills) \nand duty of loyalty (avoiding conflicts of interest and acting solely in the interests \nof the company upon making decisi ons in relation to its business).”  \n833. Good faith is an important ingredient of the se duties.  As Mr Beketov confirme d in an \nunchallenged part of his supplemental report , good faith is to be treated as the source \nof the Supervisory Board’s obligation s to monitor the Bank’s activities .  The way he \nput the point as a matter of general principle was : \n“I would also refer to paragraph 2.4 of the “Methodological Recommendations on \nImprovement of Corporate Governance in Banks of Ukraine”, approved by NBU \nResolution No. 98 dated 28 March 2007, … which state that a bank’s supervisory \nboard members have a duty to monitor the activities of their bank: “The d"}

The way he \nput the point as a matter of general principle was : \n“I would also refer to paragraph 2.4 of the “Methodological Recommendations on \nImprovement of Corporate Governance in Banks of Ukraine”, approved by NBU \nResolution No. 98 dated 28 March 2007, … which state that a bank’s supervisory \nboard members have a duty to monitor the activities of their bank: “The duty of \ngood faith also imposes on the members of the supervisory boards permanent \nresponsibility for monitoring the bank’s compliance with the legislation of Ukraine, \nas w ell as for the bank’s activities as such”.  In July 2022, the Supreme Court \nreferred to and described this duty as follows:  \n“110. Methodological recommendations for improving corporate governance \nin Ukrainian banks prescribes that the duty of good faith requires managers \nto make decisions based on all necessary information, responsibility for \nmonitoring the bank’s compliance wi th Ukrainian law, as well as the bank’s \nactivities as such. When making decisions, managers can rely on information \nprovided by bank employees, but this possibility does not release them from \npersonal responsibility for making independent decisions (clause  2.4)” .” \n834. In cross -examination, Mr Alyoshin accepted that members of the Supervisory Board \nwere officers of a joint stock company’s bodies for the purposes of Article  63 and \nexecutives of a bank for the purpose of Article  42 and Article 43.  In the light of the \ndefinition s of officers in the JSC Law and executives in the Law on Banks he was \nplainly right about this.  His evidence as to whether they were also representatives of a \nlegal entity (viz. the Bank) for the purposes of Article  92(3) was initially more \ncircums pect, but I am satisfied on a fair reading of his evidence that he agreed with Mr \nBeketov’s clear evidence that, when members of a supervisory board are acting in the \nname of their bank, they are obliged to act in its interests, in good faith, reasonably a nd \nwithout exceeding their authority.  \n835. It was also common ground that the ‘other documents’ of a company for the purposes \nof Article 63(1) , or of a bank for the purposes of Article 42 , would include documents \nsuch as the internal regulations of the Supervisory Board and the ECC in the present \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n208 \n case.  However, in a number of other respects, the content of the duties owed by the \nmember of the Supervisory Board, including most relevantly for present purpose the \nIndividual Defendants, was not common ground.  In particular there was a difference \nbetween Mr Beketov and Mr Al yoshin on the important question of when these duties \nare engaged.   \n \nUnlawful conduct: scope and context of the fiduciary duties  \n836. There were two aspects of the evidence on which the disagreement was more than a \ndifference in emphasis and can properly be characterised as a difference of substance.  \nThe first is whether the members of a bank’s supervisory board owe these duties at all \ntimes (which was Mr Beketov’s opinion), or whether those duties only arise when those \nmembers are performing their roles, by which he meant acting in their capacity as s uch.  \nIn Mr Alyoshin’s view, a member of a supervisory board will not be liable to a ba nk \nunder these provisions if he caused harm to the bank other than by his conduct as a \nmember of the supervisory board.  The way that he explained this in report was that “it \nis necessary to show a specific and direct connection between his duties and cond uct as \nan officer of the Bank and the losses sustained”.  He also said:  \n“these duties are owed by: a) members of company's bodies and those with \nauthority to act in the company's name when and to the extent that they act towards \nthird parties on the company's"}

He also said:  \n“these duties are owed by: a) members of company's bodies and those with \nauthority to act in the company's name when and to the extent that they act towards \nthird parties on the company's behalf and/or b) members of the company's bodies \nwhen they vote on c orporate decisions that are subsequently put into effect by way \nof making transactions with third parties as per (a)”  \n837. This was an important difference of view, relied on by Mr Kolomoisky when the case \nwas opened on his behalf , although only really developed in closing argument on behalf \nof Mr Bogolyubov .  Its significance was explained by Mr Al yoshin in the following \nterms in his supplemental report:  \n“The significance of this is that, following Mr Beketov’s approach, a Supervisory \nBoard member who participates in a scheme to embezzle funds from the bank “self -\nevidently” breaches his fiduciary duties to the bank, because he is under a duty to \nact in the  bank’s interests at all times, and he has necessarily failed to do so.  On \nthe other hand, if a Supervisory Board member is only subject to fiduciary duties \nat certain times, it becomes necessary to analyse the acts or omissions that are \nalleged to have r esulted in the embezzlement of the bank’s funds and whether they \noccurred in the course of the performance of activities or obligations to which \nfiduciary duties applied.”  \n838. When this evidence was tested during the course of his cross -examination, Mr Al yoshin \ninitially seemed reluctant to accept that a member of a supervisory board could ever be \nacting in breach of fiduciary duty if he did or failed to do something in a context other \nthan while acting as such.  However, when pressed, he accepted that a board member \nwas under a duty to disclose any personal interest in a related transaction from the \nmoment in time he became aware of it, i rrespective of whether he was involved qua \nboard member in the actual decision to transact. He also eventually accepted that, if a \nmember of a supervisory board knew that a misappropriation of the relevant company’s \nassets was about to happen, it “could also be breach of fiduciary duty” and “it ma y \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n209 \n amount also to the breach of supervisory duty” to fail  or at least not to take steps  to stop \nit. \n839. Mr Beketov was also cross -examined on this point on the basis that it could not possibly \nbe the case that the chairman of a bank was required to have regard to its best interest s \nwhen (e.g.) negotiating with the board for a larger bonus .  It was said on behalf of  Mr \nBogolyubov in cl osing that , as a result of this cross -examination , he changed  his \napproach .  On a proper analysis of the evidence, I disagree.  It remained Mr Beketov ’s \nopinion , which I accept,  that in those circumstances the chairman  could not simply have \nregard to his own interests without regard to what might properly be thought to have \nbeen the best interests of the bank ; his evidence  remained  that a chairman in such \ncircumstances  could not abuse his power in some way to improve his negotiating \nposition.  The touchstone  continued to be  whether his conduct in the performance or \nnon-performance of his official duties was in the best interests of the bank, or whether \nit amounted to the improper use of his office (whether through action or inaction) to \nfurther his own interests.   \n840. The Bank submitted that Mr Alyoshin’s evidence on this point was incoherent and \nillogical.

The Bank submitted that Mr Alyoshin’s evidence on this point was incoherent and \nillogical.  The submission was based on Mr Beketov’s evidence to the effect that such \na conclusion would be inconsistent with the fact that (as Mr Alyoshin accepted) a \nfiduciar y duty can be breached by omission as well as positive action and would mean \nthat members of a supervisory board (amongst others) could disregard their duties when \nmaking decisions regarding internal company matters.  He also pointed out that it took \nno ac count of the fact that Article  43 formulates the duty owed by a bank’s executives \nas including an obligation to refrain from using their office in their own personal \ninterests, a restriction which was plainly wide enough to cover preventing the use of \nknowledge acquired through their position at the bank for their own p ersonal advantage.  \n841. The Bank also submitted that a significant ground for preferring Mr Beketov’s evidence \non this point is that it is more consistent with, and indeed supported by a number of \ndecisions of the Supreme Court. The starting point is the resolution  of the Grand \nChamber of the Supreme Court in Ukoo pspilka  in which the court was concerned with \na claim by the DGF, acting as liquidator of Ukoopspilka, against members of its former \nmanagement.  The allegations were that the defendants acted in breach of duty by \npermitting JSB Ukoopspilka to expend 60% of the value of its assets in the purchase of \nloss-making unsecured bonds issued by entities connected to its owners.  Amongst the \nallegations were that the defendants failed to perform the functions of risk management \nand monitor ing which led to the withdrawal of funds which caused loss to Ukoopspilka \nand its creditors . \n842. As the Grand Chamber made clear at [7.14] to [7.17], the duties with which Article  92 \nwere concerned extended to a duty of care to act in good faith for the benefit of the \ncompany’s development, devoting sufficient time and effort and professional skills to \nits management and a duty of loyalty to avoid conflicts of interest and act in the best \ninterests of the company when making decisions on its activities.  In that case, the \ninsolvency of the bank caused by the purchase of loss -making assets was caused in \nmaterial part by the passive inaction of its managers to act in good faith to prevent \npossible risks.   In short, the harm in the form of the bank’s insolvency was found to \nhave been a consequence of two categories of unlawful act – the “active actions” of the \nactual signing of the contracts pursuant to which the loss-making  bonds were acquired \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n210 \n and what the Grand Chamber called “passive inaction”, both of which therefore \nfounded the liability . \n843. Initially, Mr Alyoshin’s evidence was that the resolution  of the Grand Chamber in \nUkoo pspilka  was subsequently cancelled (as it was) and that  subsequent decisions of \nthe Supreme Court had not applied its reasoning .  However, he later accepted that he \nwas wrong about the reasoning, because in  the more recent resolution of the Supreme \nCourt in case No. 916/1522/22, DGF  v. Persons 1 to 18  (“Finrostbank ”) (decided just \nbefore the start of the trial) at [36]  and [45], the court cited and applied Ukoopspilka  \nwith particular reference t o its discussion of breaches of duty by omission .  The \nSupreme Court in Finrostbank  also confirmed that the subsequent cancellation of \nUkoo pspilka  had nothing to do with its description of the relevant principles:  \n“the cancellation did not occur due to a change in the legal position of the Court, \nwhic"}

The \nSupreme Court in Finrostbank  also confirmed that the subsequent cancellation of \nUkoo pspilka  had nothing to do with its description of the relevant principles:  \n“the cancellation did not occur due to a change in the legal position of the Court, \nwhich is set out in the said decision, but in connection with other circumstances \nestablished by the cassation court …”.  \n844. It was also suggested by Mr Alyoshin that  Ukoo pspilka  and the later resolution of the \nSupreme Court in Bank Daniel  were only concerned with actual decisions to approve \nimproper transactions taken by the supervisory board when discharging its functions as \nsuch.   He said:  \n“There is no finding in any of the cases that the supervisory board members would \nhave been held liable under Article 43 of the Law on Banks or Article 92 of the \nCivil Code for wrongdoing committed in a different capacity, simply because they \nhappened to be members of the supervisory board.”  \n845. However, I think that Mr Beketov is correct to point out that the Supreme Court in Bank \nDaniel  also relied on the failures “to exercise proper control over the business indicators \nof the bank” as an unlawful omission which was causative of the bank’s insolvency.  \nThis was a failure by the members of that bank’s supervisory board to comply with \ntheir duty (as described by Mr Beketov’s unchallenged evidence) to monitor the \nactivities of its management board and to protect the rights of depositors and other \ncreditors of the bank: Article  37(3) of the Law on Banks.  This included amongst other \nmatters the exclusive competence under Article  39(5) of the Law of Banks to ensure \nthe proper operation of the policies set by them and the supervision of their \neffectiveness.  \n846. This is also consistent with the approach to Ukoo pspilka  taken by the Supreme Court \nin case No. 910/9851/20, DGF  v. Persons 1 -12 (“Trust Bank ”), in which the court \nreached a similar view , this time b ased on  the concept of a  ‘fiduciary duty’ defined in \nthe Guidelines on Improving Corporate Governance in Ukrainian Banks, approved by \nResolution of the Board of the NBU on  28 March 2007, which were in force during the \nperiod s relevant to bot h Trust Bank  and the present proceedings : \n“In accordance with clause 1.12, Chapter 1, Section I of these Guidelines, a \nfiduciary duty is an obligation to act in the best interests of another person. The \nbank’s manager (fiduciary) is obliged to act in the best interests of the bank (i.e., \nall its shareholder and clients), and not in personal  (private) interests. A fiduciary \nis always required to act in good faith and with impartiality. A fiduciary must be \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n211 \n honest and must not conduct business in a manner that provides him/her with undue \nbenefits or harms the interests of clients or shareholders …   \nWith regard to the regulation of banks, such documents are not only the above -\nmentioned Guidelines, but also the Corporate Governance Principles of the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (hereinafter referred to \nas the OECD), adopted at a meeting of the OECD Council in 1999 (applied by the \nGrand Chamber of the Supreme Court in  [Ukoopspilka ] at clause 7.15) . \nThe above Guidelines are indeed advisory in nature, but at the same time they set \na certain standard of proper behavio ur for bank managers, characterized by \nincreased requirements for good faith and reasonableness, prudence and decision -\nmaking in conducting business activities, taking into account the interests of the \nlegal entity they represent.  \nIn view of the foregoing, the Supreme Court considers that the courts of pre"}

The resolution of the Supreme Court in case No. 904/8586/21, SFG Hermes  LLC v. \nSoldatkin (“SFG Hermes ”), which was handed down on 14 June 2023 after the trial in \nthe pre sent proceed ings had started , was a further case in which the Supreme Court \nreferred to Ukoopspilka  as a leading authority on the content of fiduciary duties and \nmade clear that it was of general appl ication and not confined to the particular \ncircumstances of that case . \n848. In my view , the Bank was correct to submit that the effect of the cases to which it \nreferred in its closing submissions, supported as they were by Mr Beketov’s evidence , \nwas that i n order to comply with the ir fiduciary duties, bank officials (including \ntherefore members of the Bank’s Supervisory Board) must not only ensure that their \nactions are taken in good faith, reasonably and in the best interests of the Bank, but \nmust also ensure that they have responsibly managed the Bank and taken measures to \npreven t so-called ‘risky activity’.   If they are guilty of culpable inaction , their conduct \nis unlawful for the purposes of Article 1166 and it is as capable of extending to a \nculpable failure to take steps to prevent a misappropriation (where an officer simply \ndoes nothing), as it is to take active steps in his capacity as such to procure or enable it.  \n \nIs a criminal offence an unlawful act?  \n849. When Mr Al yoshin was then asked whether the position was not even clearer if the \nboard members who failed to stop the misappropriation were the very people who in \nfact instructed it, his response was that this was not necessarily the case, largely because \nthe example put to him looked like something that was punishable or prohibited under \nthe criminal law , but was no t unlawful as a matter of civil law .  This was the second \naspect of the experts’ evidence on which there was more between him and Mr Beketov  \nthan a difference in emphasis . \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n212 \n 850. This point was ultimately not pursued by any of the Defendants in their closing \narguments . The reason that they took this course was not that they accepted that Mr \nBeketov’s view was to be preferred to that of Mr Alyoshin  and Mr Nahnybida , but \nrather that they conceded that the point (like a similar point in relation to Article 228 of \nthe Civil Code (“Article 228”) with which I deal elsewhere in this judgment) was an \nevidential question and therefore a matter for English law as the lex fori ; it followed \nthat Ukrainian law principles did not apply.   Nonetheless, I still  think it is necessary for \nme to deal with the experts ’ evidence  on the point , albeit briefly , because  the views that \nMr Alyoshin and Mr Nah nybida expressed did not stand up to scrutiny and were a \nfurther example of aspects of their evidence which I regarded as unreliable . \n851. There was no dispute between the experts that there is no specific tort of \nmisappropriation or embezzlement under Ukrainian law, but t he difference can be \nsummarised by the way in which they expressed their position in paragraph 39 of their \njoint statement:  \n“[Mr Beketov's] view is that court practice shows that embezzlement "}

There was no dispute between the experts that there is no specific tort of \nmisappropriation or embezzlement under Ukrainian law, but t he difference can be \nsummarised by the way in which they expressed their position in paragraph 39 of their \njoint statement:  \n“[Mr Beketov's] view is that court practice shows that embezzlement and \nmisappropriation of funds, in addition to being criminally punishable, separately \nwill give rise to standalone liability in tort if the elements of Article 1166 are \nsatisfied. Even if that conduct has not been prosecuted as a crime, its unlawfulness \nfor purposes of Article 1166 may arise from (for example) an intention to cause, or \nactually causing harm to the victim's property rights and/or the defendant's breach \nof duty … ;  \n[Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida] disagree: in their view, embezzlement or \nmisappropriation of funds as understood under criminal law are unlawful under the \ncriminal law only … . In appropriate cases, the defendant will be liable in tort to \nthe extent that hi s or her conduct violates rules or prohibitions applicable to that \ndefendant.”  \n852. The way this point was pleaded  in the Individual Defendants ’ statements of case was \nthat conduct which is prohibited only by the Criminal Code cannot be relied upon as \nthe unlawful conduct element of a cause of action under Article 116 6 unless such \nconduct has been determined to be criminal by a criminal court.   In that context, t he \nUkrainian Criminal Procedure Code  provide s that a person who has suffered damage \nas a result of a criminal offence has the opportunity to vindicate his  right s during \ncriminal pr oceeding by filing a civil lawsuit against an accused which may then be \ndetermined in those proceedings .  However, t he word “only” is important, because the \npoint which was at the core of the evidence given on behalf of the Individual Defendants \nwas that, merely because conduct  amounting to embezzlement or misappropriation of \nfunds was punishable unlawful conduct under the Criminal Code , does not mean that it \nis also actionable unlawful conduct for the purposes of the civil liability under Article \n1166.  \n853. There was a time at which Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida appeared to be suggesting \nthat this meant that embezzlement or misappropriation of funds  could not, absent a \ncriminal conviction, also be the subject of a civil claim in tort simply by reason of the \nfact that such conduct constituted a crime .  Thus Mr Alyoshin  said in the joint statement \nthat “entering into a loan with a prior intention of not repaying the money would, in \nappropriate circumstances, constitute a criminal act.   Such conduct would not be \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n213 \n remediable under tort law independently from a criminal conviction .”  The way this \npoint was put in Mr Bogolyubov’s written opening was that:  \n“Victims of behaviour such as misappropriation can seek compensation from the \ndefendant either within criminal proceedings or, following the defendant’s \nconviction in the criminal court, by the bringing of a tortious claim under Art. 1166 \nof the Civil Code  relying upon the criminal conviction as proof of the necessary \nelement of unlawful conduct.   Critically, however, a finding of criminal conduct \ncan only be made by a criminal court.   Therefore, conduct which is unlawful only \nin Ukrainian criminal law cann ot supply the necessary element of unlawful conduct \nfor a tortious claim under Art. 1166 unless and until the defendant has been \nconvicted of such conduct in criminal proceedings. ” \n854. To similar effect, t he Corporate Defendants ’ position  can most clearly be seen from Mr \nNahny bida’s supplemental report in which he  said: \n“Moreover, taking into accou"}

Therefore, conduct which is unlawful only \nin Ukrainian criminal law cann ot supply the necessary element of unlawful conduct \nfor a tortious claim under Art. 1166 unless and until the defendant has been \nconvicted of such conduct in criminal proceedings. ” \n854. To similar effect, t he Corporate Defendants ’ position  can most clearly be seen from Mr \nNahny bida’s supplemental report in which he  said: \n“Moreover, taking into account that the alleged embezzlement or misappropriation \nof funds is criminally punishable conduct under Articles 190 or 191 of the Criminal \nCode of Ukraine (the \"Criminal Code\")  and the Bank's allegations on the Corporate \nDefendants' procurement and/or assistance in the misappropriation of the Bank's \nfunds and in the subsequent concealment of the same, in my view, for the Bank to \nrely on abovementioned conduct as unlawful conduct for the purposes of a claim \nunder Article 1166 of the Civil Code, the Bank would first require a criminal court's \nfinding of illegality by the Corporate Defendants in allowing their bank accounts \nto be used for the transfer  of allegedly misappropriated money. ” \n855. However, what Mr Nahnybida’s  evidence do es not go on to explain  is that Ukrainian \nlaw permits  a victim of  a misappropriation to sue in a civil court on the basis of civil \nlaw unlawfulness (such as breach of duty) , even where the facts which form the basis \nof that unlawfulness would also be sufficient to establish the commission of an  offence .  \nMr Alyoshin accepted that was the case  in his supplemental report , and I consider he \nwas right to do so .  Where t he same  factual allegations of misconduct give rise t o both \nliability for the offences of misappropriation or embezzlement under the Criminal Code \nand also civil law unlawfulness, those same facts  are capable of being sufficient to \nfound a claim under Article 1166 .  As he accepted  “If on the facts while committing \nmisappropriation, the defendants also breach their fiduciary duties or another civil law \nduty,  the breach of duty could itself give rise to a tort claim .” \n856. To go further , as Mr Nahnybida appeared to do,  and suggest that , where the same facts \nwould establish both the commission of a criminal offence  and a breach of a civil law \nduty, a claim cannot be brough t under Article 1166 until the defendant has be en \nconvicted is  not the law of Ukraine .  As the Bank submitted, if that were to be the law \nof Ukraine, there would be very surprising results in the case of companies such as the \nCorporate Defendants , which it was common ground cannot be prosecuted . \n857. This was an area on which Mr Nahn ybida was cross -examined and gave answers which \nwere difficult to accept .  When he first addressed this point in his fourth report , he had \nsaid that , for the Bank to succeed in a claim under Article 1166  against the Corporate \nDefendants relying on their procurement and/or assistance in the misappropriation of \nthe Bank’s funds , the Bank would first require a criminal court’s finding of illegality \nby them in allowing their bank accounts to be used in this way.   He then correct ed his \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n214 \n evidence , because he had to accept (as became common ground ), that in the words of  \nMr Beketov “… under Ukrainian criminal law only a natural person, and not a legal \nentity, can be prosecuted for a crime”. This gave rise to a n obvious  difficulty for Mr \nNahnybida’s  analysis , because it meant  that, if he was right , a corporate entity could \nnever be liable under the civil law for a misappropriation or act of embezzlement , \nbecause it could not be prosecuted  which he had said was a necessary pre requisite to \nthe misappropr iation or embezzlement being unlawful for Article 1166 purposes . \n858. I agree with Mr Beketov’s evidence that this would  be"}
{"start": 801500, "text": "al \nentity, can be prosecuted for a crime”. This gave rise to a n obvious  difficulty for Mr \nNahnybida’s  analysis , because it meant  that, if he was right , a corporate entity could \nnever be liable under the civil law for a misappropriation or act of embezzlement , \nbecause it could not be prosecuted  which he had said was a necessary pre requisite to \nthe misappropr iation or embezzlement being unlawful for Article 1166 purposes . \n858. I agree with Mr Beketov’s evidence that this would  be a “nonsensical outcome”. I also \nagree with the Bank’s submission that Mr Nahnybida’s  suggestion  that the answer to \nthe nonsense is that a corporate entity must be held vicariously liable for the criminal \noffences of an employee who has been convicted by a criminal court before any claim \nunder Article 1166 can be brought against it , is most unlikely to be the law of Ukraine. \nThere was no authority to support the suggestion and in my judgment it is wrong .  I am \nsatisfied  that Mr Nahnybida’s evidence on this point  was an attempt by him to salvage \nan unsustainable position  which was advanced by way of argument because it was in \nhis clients ’ interests to make the point and does him no credit as an independent expert \nwith a duty to assist the court . \n859. In my judgment the true position under the law of Ukraine is as follows.  The \ncommission of a criminal offence can of itself and without more give rise to the \nnecessary unlawfulness for Article 1166 purposes .  In that context, the claimant can \nseek to use the criminal proceedings to obtain appropriate civil law redress  once the \ndefendant has been convicted .  But if the commission of an offence is the only \nunlawfulness relied on , the claimant cannot proceed under Article 1166 until the \ndefendant has been convicted.  If, however,  the same facts also  give rise to civil law \nunlawfulness, such as a breach of duty or other actionable breach of the Civil Code, \nthat unlawfulness is capable of founding the first element of a claim under Article 1166 , \nindependently of the criminal offence and whether or not the defendant has also been \nconvicted  of it. \n \nActs of procurement  as unlawful acts  \n860. There was disagreement between Mr Be ketov  and Mr Alyoshin  as to the circumstances \nin which a  person who procure s another to commit an unlawful act causing harm ( such \nas misappropriation ) will have committed an unlawful act himself  for the purposes of \nArticle 1166 .  Mr Beketov ’s evidence was that, if the act of procurement was done  with \nintent to cause the harm or was in breach of duty or was otherwise unlawful , the \nprocurer ’s own conduct will have been unlawful.   Mr Alyoshin’s position was slightly \ndifferent.  Taking  by way of example the act of a borrower  entering into a loan with a \nprior intention of not repaying the money, his evidence was that , regardless of the \nunlawfulness of the borrowe r’s conduct , the act of the procurer in causing the borrower \nto enter into a loan in such circumstances , is only actionable if the act of procuring  itself \namounted to independent unlawful conduct ; intent to cause the harm was not of itself \nsufficien t. \n861. This is another area in which  on a proper analysis,  the disagreement between the experts \nwas of little practical significance  as against the Individual Defendants.  The evidence \ndid not establish that there is any free-standing c laim against a person who procures a \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n215 \n breach of duty by somebody else.  The situation is only different where the act of \nprocuring is , in the particular context , an unlawful act .  The Bank contended that , in the \ncase of the Individual Defendants,  procurement of all or any part of the \nMisappropriation would inevitably be a breach of what the experts colloquially called \nthe fiduciary duties .  It followed that in closing its case the Bank  did not rely on"}

The Bank contended that , in the \ncase of the Individual Defendants,  procurement of all or any part of the \nMisappropriation would inevitably be a breach of what the experts colloquially called \nthe fiduciary duties .  It followed that in closing its case the Bank  did not rely on the \nIndividual Defendants having done anything by way of procurement which, while done \nwith intent to cause harm , was not itself a plain breach of one or more of the duties I \nhave just discussed  and therefore an unlawful act in its own right.  \n \nBreaches of Articles 3 and 13  as unlawful conduct  \n862. The second relevant category of unlawfulness rests on  different foundation s to the \nclaim s against the Individual Defendants  for acting or omitting to act  in breach of one \nor more of the fiduciary duties  under  Article 63 , Articles 42 , Article 43 and Article 92.   \nThis second way of putting the Bank’s case applies to each of the Defe ndants  (i.e., \nincluding the Corporate Defendants) and is  that their participation in  the \nMisappropriation and its subsequent concealment were unlawful  by operation of other \nparts of the Civil Code , and that this conduct qualified as unlawful for the purposes of \nArticle 1166 . \n863. In particular, i t was said that the acts, decisions or omissions which the  Defendants  \nprocure d or in which they assisted  led to the Bank being deprived of the ownership of \nits property in a manner not provided for by the constitution of Ukraine or the law \n(contrary to Article 3 (1)(2)) and amounted to acting in a manner that violated the Bank’s  \nrights with the intention to injure it  and/or an abuse of rights contrary to Article 13.  \n864. Article 3(1) is in the following  terms : \n“The general foundations of civil law will be:  \n1) prohibition on arbitrary interference in private life;  \n2) unacceptability of ownership deprivation except as established by the \nConstitution of Ukraine and the law;   \n3) freedom of contract;  \n4) freedom of enterprise, save for activities prohibited by law;  \n5) judicial defence of civil rights and interests;  \n6) justness, good faith and reasonableness.”  \n865. Parts of Article 13 are also relied on by the Bank for the same purpose .  There was more \nthan one translation of these provisions in the trial bundle but  nobody suggested that \nany material question turned on the precise wording  and it seems to me that the \nfollowing form of words is the right one to use : \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n216 \n “2. When exercising their rights, a person is obliged to refrain from actions that \ncould violate the rights of others, cause harm to the environment or cultural \nheritage.  \n3. Actions of a person committed with the intent to harm another person, as well as \nthe abuse of right in other forms, are not allowed.”  \n866. At the heart of the debate between the experts o n this issue  is whether a violation of \nArticle 3 or Article 13  could, in and of itself , constitute  an unlawful act or omission  for \nthe purposes of the claim under Article 1166 . \n867. Mr Beketov said that the principles enshrined in these two Articles, and in particular \nArticle 3(1)(2) providing for a prohibition on “ownership deprivation” and Articles \n13(2) -(3) providing for a prohibition on abusing the rights of others , constitute \nsubstantive rules of conduct that are mandatory for all civil law relationships.  He said \nthat they are principles of law which have direct effect and which a Ukrainian court will \ntake into account when considering whether a defendant’s conduct is unlawful.

He said \nthat they are principles of law which have direct effect and which a Ukrainian court will \ntake into account when considering whether a defendant’s conduct is unlawful.  The \nBank therefore relied on this evidence in support of its case that non -compliance with \nthese mandatory substantive rules was unlawful conduct for the purpose of its claims \nunder Article 1166 against both the Corporate Defendants and the Individual \nDefendants.  \n868. Mr Alyoshin  and Mr Nahnybida  disagreed .  They described the language of Article  3 \nas interpr etative and both Articles as  laying down  principles and guidelines , which \nshould be taken into account when interpreting the norms contained in the other acts of \ncivil legislation , but not in themselves impos ing specific duties.   Mr Nahnybida  also \nsaid that Article s 3 and 13 did not enact  specific mandatory rules of law .  He said that \nthe essence of what was alleged as improper conduct by the Corporate Defendants was \nthe creation and execution of documents to disguise and hide the Misappropriation, \nwhich, absent a criminal conviction (as to which see above) was not  unlawful conduct \nfor the purposes of a claim under Article 1166 .  As he put it in his report:  \n“Essentially, the Bank would have to identify a specific rule which would prohibit \nthe Corporate Defendants from (1) entering into the Relevant Supply Agreements \nwith the Borrowers, (2) receiving money under the Relevant Supply Agreements \non prepayment ter ms and (3) to dispose of the money after receiving the same from \nthe Borrowers. The Bank has not sought to do so.”  \n869. It followed that, although the experts were agreed that a defendant’s conduct can be \nunlawful if it breaches any provision of the Ukrainian constitution , laws (statutes) etc \n(as described above), Mr Alyoshin  and Mr Nahnybida said that there is  no tortious \nliability which arises as a result of what is said to be a breach of  Article 3(1) because \nthat Article  makes provision for “general principles of civil law (and only such \nprinciples) rather than directly applicable provisions rendering specific conduct \nunlawful.”  \n870. In support of his position that what he called “general principles of civil legislation” are \nto be distinguished from rules which impose a specific duty , Mr Alyoshin said that \nthose general principles are used primarily to interpret the law and to ensure that it is \napplied in a principled and coherent way but cannot be the basis of a claim in \nthemselves.   In developing this theme during the course of his cross -examination, Mr \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n217 \n Alyoshin disagreed with the proposition that the violation of one of the principles in \nArticle 3 is a violation of the Civil Code.  He said that the principles were not specific \nenough to form a duty and that they only worked in conjunction with other rule s of the \nCivil Code.  \n871. The starting point for  Mr Alyoshin ’s evidence  was a judgment  of the Constitutional \nCourt  dated 5 June 2019  in case No. 3-391/2018(6048/1 8), Metro Cash & Carry \nUkraine LLC , in which it held , adopting a decision of the EC tHR, that: \n“a legal rule cannot be regarded as a ‘law’ unless it is formulated with sufficient \nclarity to enable individuals to regulate their own conduct  … the prescriptions of \nlaw must be accessible to the person concerned to enable him or her to foresee the \nconsequences  of their application. ” \n872. His evidence was that  it was therefore necessary to work out whether the general \nprinciples laid down by Articles 3(1) and 13 were sufficiently  certain , given that the \nConstitutional Court has also determined that a law will be unfair if it lacks certainty.   \nIn his view , "}
{"start": 812000, "text": "cient \nclarity to enable individuals to regulate their own conduct  … the prescriptions of \nlaw must be accessible to the person concerned to enable him or her to foresee the \nconsequences  of their application. ” \n872.

Mr Alyoshin also relied on another judgment  of the Constitutional Court dated 28 April \n2021 in case No. 3-95/2020/(193 /20), PJSC Industrialbank , in which the court said as \nfollows at [ 8.2]: \n“In assessing Article 13(3) and Article l6(3) of the Code for compliance with the \nprovisions of Article 58 (2) of the Basic Law of Ukraine, the Constitutional Court \nof Ukraine states that that these provisions of the Code do no t qualif y a person's \nactions as an offence under civil law or as another condition for holding a person \nliable under civil law.   These disputed provisions of the Code impose on \nparticipants in civil relations a prohibition of violating the limits of exercise of civil \nrights and also enable a court to refuse to protect a civil right if a person violates \nthe requirements of Article 13(2)-(5) of the Code. In other w ords, these provisions \nof the Code contain an indication of the legal consequences of a person's actions, \nthat they cannot be classified as conditions, grounds or measures of liability under -\ncivil law. ” \n874. Mr Beketov did not disput e what was said by the Constitutional Court as a matter of \nconcept , but during the course of his cross -examination he pointed out that , in referr ing \nto “an offence under civil law ” the court was concerned with the issue of whether \nArticle 13 gave rise to a free -standing cause of action .  It was not concerned with the \ndifferent question of  whether conduct which transgressed Article 13 was unlawful  and \ntherefore was capable of satisfying the first  of the four elements of  a cause of action \nunder Article 1166 . \n875. As to that , Mr Beketov  relied on  a number of cases which he said  demonstrated , when \ntaken together, that a person who deprives another of their property other than in \naccordance with Ukrainian law or takes any action intended to harm another , acts \nunlawfully for the purposes of Article 1166.   There were two themes to the evidence on \nthis point.  The first was  that the Supreme Court has often characterised the principles \nas rules of direct application.  The second was that there are a number of cases  in whic h \nthe Supreme Court  has used Articles 3 and 13 as a basis for  granting the claimant relief \nor precluding the defendant from relying on a defence.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n218 \n 876. As to the first of these themes, in case No. 908/1152/18, Sberbank JSC  v. Yuststar Law \nFirm LLC  (“Sberbank ”), the Supreme Court was concerned with two of the other \nparagraphs within Article 3(1) (viz. Articles 3 (1)(3) and 3 (1)(6)).  It said that the \nprinciples set out in Articles 3 and 13 were not just embodied in other provisions of the \nlaw but were of direct application in their own right.  The way that it explained the \nposition, in the context of the interrelationship between the principle of freedom of \ncontract expressed in Article 3(1)(3) and the obligation to act with fairness, good faith \nand reasonableness in Article 3(1)(6) was as follows:  \n“At the same time, the principle enshrined by the legislator of the possibility of \nrestricting the freedom of contract by virtue of the general principles of fairness, \ngood faith, reasonableness can be applied as a rule of direct action, as a direct legal \nmeans of regulating rights and obligations in legal relations.”  \n877. Mr Aly oshin said that, in the event, the Supreme Court in Yu"}

Mr Aly oshin said that, in the event, the Supreme Court in Yuststar  applied these \nprinciple s indirectly, because it eventually applied them as a means of limiting the \nfreedom of contract for which provision was made under Article 3(1)(3) and as an aid \nto interpreting Article 13(2) and did not distinguish between direct and indirect \napplication.  It was a little difficult to understand what he meant by this, but he went on \nto summarise his position as follows:  \n“Court practice yields no clear answer to the question when and to what extent such  \nprinciples can be applied independently. It demonstrates that abstract general \nprinciples are given substance through, or applied jointly with, other rules and \ndoctrines of varying specificity ... I am not aware of cases where general principles \nhave actua lly been used as an independent basis of tortious liability where the \ndefendant’s conduct was not unlawful in any other, more specific respect.”  \n878. Another case in which the concept of direct application of the Articles 3 and 13 was \nconsidered by the Supreme Court was  one initially cited by Mr Alyoshin,  Person 1  v. \nLOS Karlivske Agricultural Enterprise  (Cas No 540/544/18) , in which the Supreme \nCourt said:  \n“It appears from the interpretation of both Article 3 of the Civil Code of Ukraine \nin general and clause 6 of Article 3 of the Civil Code of Ukraine that the general \nprinciples of civil law have a fundamental nature and other sources of legal \nregulation, p rimarily acts of civil legislation, must correspond to the content of the \ngeneral principles. This, in particular, manifests in the fact that the general \nprinciples are essentially the directly applicable rules.”  \n879. It was said by Mr Alyoshin  that, in its application to the facts,  this was an example of a \ncase in which the Supreme Court did not distinguish between direct and indirect \napplication of Article 3 and Article 13.  This  fact led him to conclude that there was no \nclear answer to the question when and to what extent the se general principles can be \napplied independently.  He made the same point by reference to  the resolution of the \nSupreme Court in  case No. 638/16768/19,  Alfa Bank JSC v. Persons 1 and 2 , to which \nhe was taken in cross -examination.  This was another case concerned with the \napplication of fairness, good faith and reasonableness (Article 3 (1)(6)) to the principle \nof freedom of contract  (Article 3 (1)(3)), in which  the Supreme Court expressed the \ngeneral position as follows:  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n219 \n “The general principles of civil law include, in particular, fairness, good faith, and \nreasonableness (clause 6, Article 3 of the Civil Code of Ukraine).   It appears from \nthe interpretation of both Article 3 of the Civil Code of Ukraine in general and \nclause 6 Article 3 of the Civil Code of Ukraine that the general principles of civil \nlaw have a fundamental nature and other sources of legal regulation, primari ly acts \nof civil legislation, must correspond to the content of the general principles. This, \nin pa rticular, is manifested in the fact that the general principles are in their essence \nthe norms of direct effect and must be taken into account, in particular, when \ninterpreting the norms contained in the acts of civil legislation.”  \n880. In his closing submissions, Mr Plewman, consistently with the evidence given by Mr \nAlyoshin, said that the way in which the last sentence should be co"}
{"start": 819000, "text": "imari ly acts \nof civil legislation, must correspond to the content of the general principles. This, \nin pa rticular, is manifested in the fact that the general principles are in their essence \nthe norms of direct effect and must be taken into account, in particular, when \ninterpreting the norms contained in the acts of civil legislation.”  \n880. In his closing submissions, Mr Plewman, consistently with the evidence given by Mr \nAlyoshin, said that the way in which the last sentence should be construed is that it \nreflects the circumstances in which general principles must be taken into account, viz.  \nwhen interpreting the rules to be found elsewhere in the law, including the Civil Code.  \nI do not think that it is possible to read the language in that way.  There is no doubt that \nthe courts of Ukraine will take into account the general principles when interpreting \nother more specific provisions, but that cannot be read as limiting the description of \nthem as “in essence the norms of direct effect” with which the sentence is primarily \nconcerned .  In my view, and consistently with Mr Beketov’s evidence, the use of the \nphrase “in particular” makes clear that the Supreme Court was not limiting the \napplication of these general principles  to guidelines for the interpretation of other \nprovisions of the Civil Code . \n881. The effect of the Supreme Court’s approach is that, while Article 3(1)(3) makes direct \nprovision for freedom of contract, that freedom of contract is regulated under Ukrainian \nlaw by principles of fairness, good faith and reasonableness (Article 3(1)(6)), in a \nmanner which demonstrates that they are rules of direct application.  In my view this \ngives solid support to Mr Beketov’s view that in the same way, a person who deprives \nanother of their property other than in accordance with Ukrainian law  breaches A rticles \n3(1)(2) and , if he does so intending to harm another person , breaches Article 13(3).  In \nboth instances, those acts are unlawful for the purposes of Article 1166.  \n882. Mr Alyoshin also said that there is no case in which a breach of Article 3(1)(2) is relied \non as the only basis for unlawfulness, and none has been drawn to my attention.  \nHowever, I agree with the Bank’s submission that the language of several cases decid ed \nby the Supreme Court is inconsistent with his evidence that Article 3(1) is merely \ninterpretative.  They give further support to Mr  Beketov’s conclusion that the Supreme \nCourt has not qualified its approach to the application of Article 3 in the manner  \nsuggested by Mr Alyoshin, but rather treats Articles 3 and 13 as making provision for \nrules of general application which have direct effect.    \n883. The second theme , which  underpinned  Mr Beketov’s evidence that a  person who \ndeprives another of their property other than in accordance with Ukrainian law or takes \nany action intended to harm another acts unlawfully for the purposes of Article 1166 , \nrelies on  a numbers of Supreme C ourt cases which used Articles 3 and 13 as a basis for \ngranting the claimant relief or precluding the defendant from relying on a defence .  Mr \nBeketov placed specific reliance  on the  resolution s of the  Grand Chamber of the  \nSupreme Court in  case No. 369/11268/16 , Bank Familnyi  v. Persons 1 -3 (“Bank \nFamilnyi ”) and the Supreme Court in Sberbank . \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n220 \n 884. In Bank Familyni  the Grand Chamber was concerned with  a gift made in order to avoid \npayment by the judgment debtor on enforcement  of a court order .  The conduct of the \ndebtor and the donee was obviously dishonest , and the gift a mounted to what the Grand \nChamber  called an  abuse of  the property interests of the judgment creditor , being aimed \nat preventing foreclosure on the debtor’s property.

The conduct of the \ndebtor and the donee was obviously dishonest , and the gift a mounted to what the Grand \nChamber  called an  abuse of  the property interests of the judgment creditor , being aimed \nat preventing foreclosure on the debtor’s property.  It said that , although the gift did not \nviolate specific mandatory or imperative norms  (by which it meant specific rules \napplicable to what might in English law be regarded as a trans action defrauding \ncreditors) , the gift could be invalidated  under both the general  principles of civil law \ncontained in  Article 3 (1)(6) and  the prohibition o n abuse of rights in Article 13(3) . \n885. While Mr Alyoshin accepted that Bank Familyni  demonstrated that Articles  3(1)(6) and \n13(3)  could be applied in this way in the context of what he called “frauditor” con tracts \nof the type with which that case and  the resolution of the Supreme Court dated 6 March \n2019 in case No. 317/3272/16 -ts Person 1  v. Person 2  were concerned , he said that he \nwas not aware of any case where general principles were used as an independent basis \nof tortious liability in circumstances in which the defendant’s conduct was not unlawful \nin any other more specific respect.   He also pointed out , by reference to the resolution \nof the Supreme Court in case No. 727/2525/20, Svitwood Ukraine  v. Persons 1 -2, that, \nwhere a court grant s a remedy in this context by reference to the abuse of rights \ndoctrine, the remedy  with which it will often be concerned  is to invalidate  the \ntransaction (which although prima facie  lawful will not be given legal effect if aimed \nat causing harm to others), so as to enable the credito r to enforce its claim.  In his view \nthe invalidation does  not give rise to a right to compensation.  \n886. When Mr Al yoshin was cross -examined on this  particular issue , he accepted that Bank \nFamilyni  established  that conduct amounting to an abuse of rights in contr avention  of \nArticle 13 “could be treated as unlawful” , but reiterated  that it was only “for the specific \npurpose  … of contractual relations , … not for the purpose of tortious relations ”.  \nAlthough there is obviously a conceptual distinction between the two , he was unable to \nproduce any authority which applied it in this way .  In my view , the distinction espoused \nby Mr Alyoshin has little to commend it as a matter o f principle and sits uneasily wit h \nhow the unlawfulness capable of giving rise to a right to compensation is described in \nCentre Retail .  In that case the focus  is on behaviour which violat es the rights of another \nperson , and does not distinguish  between the different purposes for  which the \nunlawfulness is asserted .  I agree that the distinction adopted by Mr Alyoshin is not \nwell-founded.  \n887. An equally significant problem with the approach taken by Mr Alyoshin was the use he \nmade of two academic commentaries on this subject in his supplemental report.  He \nintroduced them as relevant to what he called “an important disagreement between Mr \nBeket ov and me as to whether the abuse of a right is capable, in itself, of giving rise to \na claim for damages in tort.”  In cross -examination he clarified that what this  meant \nwas that an abuse of rights within the meaning of Article 13 cannot be unlawful cond uct \nfor the purposes of Article 1166.  The two commentaries  he referred to were both \ncontained in a collection of Articles on Abuse of Rights edited by Professor I V \nSpasybo -Fatieieva.  The first was  entitled  The Concept, Signs and Forms of Abuse of \nSubjective Civil Rights  by M O Stefanchuk and  the second was entitle d Abuse of \nSubjective Civil Rights: Signs and Consequ ences by B P Karnau kh.

Mr Alyoshin  \nexhibited translated extracts from both articles to his report . \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n221 \n 888. As to the S tefanchuk article, Mr Alyoshin said that the following passage supported his \nevidence that an abuse of right is not capable in itself of giving rise to a claim for \ndamages in tort , in the sense that abuse of rights is not unlawful behaviour for t hat \npurpose : \n\"The special nature of the legal consequences of abuse of rights is that they should \nnot lead to liability (because abuse of rights is not a tort) ... In this  regard, the \nfollowing sanctions are among the consequences: invalidation of  transactions, \ndiscontinuation of the use of rights without their deprivation, and state refusal to \nprotect the right.\"  \n889. Presented in the way that it was by Mr Alyoshin , this citation supported his opinion .  \nHowever, during the course of his cross -examination it became evident that two pages \nlater in the same article, the author had gone on to explain the following , which was \nflatly inconsistent with his conclusion : \n“Despite all of the above, it should not be forgotten  that abuse is unlawful \nbehaviour, and according to the principle of general tort, damage to property of \nindividuals and legal entities is subject to full compensation in cases where it is \ncaused by unlawful (and, in cases provided for by law, lawful ) and, as a rule, \nculpable actions. This liability may be expressed not only in compensation for the \ndamage caused,  but also in the obligation to eliminate the negative consequences \ncaused by the abuse of the right at their own e xpense, i.e., to restore the situation \nthat existed before the violation.”  \n890. So far as the Kar naukh article is concerned , Mr Alyoshin extracted from the article and \ncited the following passage in support of his evidence that an abuse of right is not \ncapable in itself of giving rise to a claim for damages in tort:  \n“The consequence of tort is civil liability ... In turn, the consequence of an abuse \nof a right is not liability in the form of deprivation of what belongs to the individual, \nbut only the denial of recognition of a person's right to that which he sought to  \nobtain as a result of the abuse. When a person commits a civil offence, he is \ndeprived of what belongs to him; when he particularly abuses his subjective right, \nhe does not get what he sought to get. This is the essential difference between an \nordinary to rt and an abuse of a right.”  \n891. It then transpired from a complete version of the article obtained by the Bank that there \nwere two critical omissions from the citation  in Mr Alyoshin’s report .  The first was \nthat, in the tra nslation he had offered, the word “usually” was omitted fr om the phrase \n“the consequ ence of an abuse of a right is not usually  liability  in the form of …”  and at \nthe end of the very same paragraph the author had gone on to say : \n“However, there is an exception to this rule when actual harm is caused to another \nperson as a result of the abuse. In this case, the damage is subject to compensation, \nand compensation for damage is recogni sed as a measure of civil liability. This is \nnatural, since any damage caused by unlawful actions obliges the perpetrator to \ncompensate for it (see Articles 1166, 1167 of the Civil Code of Ukraine). ” \n892.

When Mr Alyoshin was cross -examined on these omissions, he denied that either  article \nwas inconsistent with his evidence t hat abuse of rights was not unlawful conduct for \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n222 \n the purposes of Article 1166 , but was unable to provide a coherent explanation either \nfor why that was so, or for why he ha d presented the views of Stefanchuk and Karnaukh \nas supportive of his own.  I have concluded that there is no logical basis on which he \ncould have done so .  Of equal importance I take the view that his selective approach to \ncitation from these articles was a particularly striking example of his tendency to argue \nthe case on behalf of Mr Kolomoisky .  It undermined my confidence in Mr Alyoshin’s \nability to give an independent and dispassionate explanation of the law of Ukraine on \nthis issue.   In my judgment, and for the reasons I have give n, Mr Beketov is corr ect on \nthis point.  \n \nUkrainian law: t he scope of Article 3(1)(2)  \n893. Mr Alyoshin also said that the scope of the general principle enshrined in Article 3(1)(2)  \nwas itself limited and that the reference to deprivation of property  only extended to \ndeprivation of property at the instance of the state .  It therefore had no application to \nallegations that the Bank was deprived of its property through the acts of any of the \nDefendants.  He said in his report  that Article 3(1)(2) does  not apply to  companies or \nindividuals  at all and went on to explain in the experts’ joint statement that  the principle \ncontained in it : \n“concerns the state to the extent  that it exercises its power as sovereign that is \nempowered, in certain cases to deprive persons of their ownership rights within the \nlimits and in accordance to the rules set out in the laws and the Constitution.”   \n894. The evidence Mr Alyoshin  gave in support of this conclusion  was again unsatisfactory.  \nHe cited no authority , but referred to an article  published by Professor  Olena Antonyuk  \nin 2017.  As presented by Mr Alyoshin, this article appeared to support his evidence \nthat Article 3(1)(2) (in conjunction with Article 41 of the Constitution) enshrined the \nprinciple of inviolability of an ownership right by providing for the protection of any \nproperty from unwarranted interference by the state , but only the state . \n895. Unfortunately,  the way in which this was presented in Mr Alyoshin’s report was  again  \nmisleading , because the passage on which he relied was taken out of context  and failed \nto explain that the author’s actual conclusions  were to precisely the opposite effect; \nsomething which only became apparent from the full version of the article, which he \ndid not exhibit to his report , but which was introduced into evidence by the Bank .  Those \nconclusions made quite clear that , the author considered  that the interference with \nwhich Article 3(1)(2) was concerned  extended to deprivations of property by private \nentities as much as it did deprivations by state bodies : \n“the content of the principle of inviolability of property right lies in the \ninadmissibility of arbitrary interference with this right by private and public law \nentities, including the state .” \n896. The day after he had been taxed with this in cross -examination, Mr Al yoshin sought t o \nsalvage the point by referring to a short extract from another work  (V.I. Borisova, I.V. \nSpasibo -Fateeva, V.L. Jarotsky (eds), Civil Law Volume 1, 2011 ), which he had \nreferred to in his supplem entary report and which he said supported his position on \nArticle 3(1)(2).

Borisova, I.V. \nSpasibo -Fateeva, V.L. Jarotsky (eds), Civil Law Volume 1, 2011 ), which he had \nreferred to in his supplem entary report and which he said supported his position on \nArticle 3(1)(2).   The extract is short, but I do not think that it does .  It simply says that \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n223 \n the principle of inadmissibility of deprivation of property rights is reflected i n “the fact \nthat the owner has rights of possession use and disposal of his property, which he \nexercises in accordance with the law of his own will and independently from others.  \nAll owners are provided with equal conditions for the exercise of their rights, and the \nstate does not interfere with such exercise. ”  This falls well short of saying that Article \n3(1)(2) is not concerned with deprivation of property rights as between private persons.  \nIn my view the Bank’s criticisms of Mr Alyoshin’s evidence on this point, including \nthe way in which he presented his opinion, were justified.  \n897. Furthermore, Mr Alyoshin was unable to point to any case in which it was held by a \ncourt that Article 3 (1)(2) is limited to expropriation  of property by the state .  Mr \nBeketov , however , referred to a number of cases in which Ukrainian courts have \nproceeded on the basis that Article 3 (1)(2) was applicable in the context of private \ndisputes  between nonstate parties .  The one on which Mr Hunter cross -examined Mr \nAlyoshin was  the resolution of the Supreme Court in case No. 902/627/19, Orthodox \nChurch of Ukraine  v. Tulchyn Diocese of the Ukrainian Orthodox  Church , which was \nconcerned with what the Supreme Court called “the elimination of obstacles in the use \nof the property of the Claimant ”.  The  issues concerned the “obligation to transfer the \nkeys and title documents ” to a complex of church buildings .  The protagonists were two \ncommunities  of the orthodox church one of which w as “canonically subordinated to the \nMoscow Patriarchate ” and the other of which was “ canonically subordinate to the \nMetrop olitanate of Kyiv ”. \n898. The lower courts had come to the conclusion that “the Claimant had not proved the fact \nof infringement of property rights or obstruction of its implementation by a legal \nentity ”; that legal entity being the  defendant  Tulchyn Diocese of the UOC.   Part of the \ndebate was about the legal identity of religious organisations , but part was concerned \nwith the question of how they are entitled to exercise their ownership rights .  In that \ncontext the Supreme Court made clear a t [73] that Article 3(1)(2) was part of the \nfoundation of the claimant’s right to rely on the “inadmissibility of deprivation of \nproperty rights, except in cases established by the Constitution of Ukraine and the law ”.  \nThe case was remitted for a retrial, and  the bases for doing so explicitly included  the \nfact that , taking into account the provisions of (amongst other enactments ) Article \n3(1)(2), religious organisations have the right to demand the rem oval of obstacles in the \nexercise of their rights to use and dispose of their property .  I agree with the Bank’s \nsubmission  that Mr Beket ov’s evidence on this point is to be preferred and that Article \n3(1)(2) does apply to claims between private parties.  \n899. Another ground advanced by Mr Alyoshin in his supplementary report for contending \nthat the scope of the general principle enshrined in Article 3 (1)(2) did not provide a \nsufficient foundation for  the claims made by the Bank was  that it is limited to protecting \nproprietary  rights and is irrelevant to the present dispute where no proprietary claims \nare advanced.

This appeared to be evidence which focussed on the nature of the relief \nsought to be obtained by the Bank, and amounted to Mr Alyoshin’s  view that , in the \nabsence of a claim for the return of identifiable property , Article 3(1)(2) had no \napplication.  \n900. When it was put to him that, irrespective of the remedy sought, the misappropriation of \nthe Bank’s funds was an interference with the Bank’s ownership rights , he initially said \nthat taking somebody’s money without a cont ractual or other lawful  entitled to do it \nwas illegal under the criminal law but was not a violation of Article 3(1)(2 ).  When \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n224 \n pressed, he accepted that  illegally taking somebody’s property is a breach of the \nproperty rights of the owner and cut s across the principle laid down by Article 3(1)(2) , \nbut he never actually accepted that it was therefore unlawful.   Mr Alyoshin’s  evidence \non this point therefore boiled  down  to the same issue  as the one  I have already \nconsidered and rejected in my discussion of the question of whether Article 3(1)(2) has \nany direct effect in the first place.   \n901. Mr Beketov  took a different approach.  His  evidence  was that Article 3 (1)(2) enshrines \nas a general principle the inviolability of private property which constitutes a rule of \nconduct that is mandatory for all participants in civil law relationships . His analysis was \nthat, by depriv ing another of their property other than in accordance with Ukrainian \nlaw, a defendant acts unlawfully for the purposes of the general tort liability.  \n902. Desp ite the Corp orate D efendants ’ submission that , if that was the case it would be \n“incredibl y surprising” , I accept  Mr Beketov’s evidence  on this issue. In  the absence of \nany established principle derived from the Constitution or the law  permitt ing such \ndeprivation , conduct which  deprive s a person of their ownership of property is contrary \nto Article 3(1)(2) and unlawful for the purposes of Article 1166.  Mr Alyoshin’s \nevidence which sought to restrict the application of Article 3(1)(2) in the respects I have \ndescribed does not reflect the law of Ukraine.  \n \nArticle 1166: Harm  \n903. The second element of the cause of action under Article 1166 is the occurrence of harm , \nwhich was described in Bank Daniel  case as “a loss of or damage caused to the property \nof the victim and /or … in general, any impairment of a benefit that is protected by law, \nand the extent thereof .”  It was common ground  between the experts that money in the \nform of cash or in a bank account is a form of property  for these purposes and that the \nloss of money is therefore capable of amounting to harm for the purposes of  a claim in \ntort under Article 1166 .  As Mr Beketov explained “ an electronic transfer of funds from \none person to another is thus capable of constituting harm to the transferor.”   The way \nthat this common ground was pleaded in Mr Kolomoisky’s  Defence throughout was : \n“It is admitted that harm for the purposes of Article 1166 can, in appropriate cases, \nencompass the transfer of a claimant’s funds to a third party. The only transfer of \nfunds belonging to the Bank occurred when the Bank transferred money to the \nBorrowers b y way of drawdowns under a Relevant Loan Facility. ” \n904. It was also common ground (and clearly spelt out in Mr Alyoshin’s evidence) that, \nwhere a person commits an unlawful a"}

The only transfer of \nfunds belonging to the Bank occurred when the Bank transferred money to the \nBorrowers b y way of drawdowns under a Relevant Loan Facility. ” \n904. It was also common ground (and clearly spelt out in Mr Alyoshin’s evidence) that, \nwhere a person commits an unlawful act involving a deprivation of property , harm is \nsuffered by  the victim at the time  it is deprived of its property  or when the defendant \nobtains the claimant’s property, depending on what makes the relevant act unlawful.  \n905. The experts agreed that the way this principle works in the present context  is that , if a \nperson  receives money pursuant to an invalid and unlawful loan agreement , the payer  \nwill be caused harm by the person who acts unlawfully in obtaining it at the time the \nagreement is entered into .  Mr Alyoshin said that this will not  be the case i f the loan \nagreement is valid and lawful , because the lender  will have r eceive d the benefit of the \nborrower ’s contractual promise to repay the loan  with interest .  However, a s he accept ed \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n225 \n in his report, if the defendant commits a wrongful act which entails a deprivation of \nproperty (such as a crime of fraud or misappropriation), harm is caused at the time when \nthe claimant is deprived of its property, or when the defendant obtains the claimant’s \nproperty, depending on what makes the act in question unlawful.  \n906. The Bank submitted, and I accept, that the consequence of this  is that , where a claimant \nis deprived of its property  pursuant to unlawful conduct , it suffers harm from the \nmoment that the deprivation occurs , with the consequence that its cause of action  under \nArticle 1166  is then complete .  The relevance  of any subsequent return of moneys to \nthe claimant gives rise to questions of assessment of the compensation to be paid, in \nother words the quantum of damages to which it is entitled.   It follows that issue s going \nto the subsequent recovery of monies of which the Bank was deprived by unlawful \nconduct go to the circumstances in which it is open to the Defendants to contend that \nany harm that may have been caused by the deprivation  was extinguished by the return \nto the Bank of the monies paid away .  This was at the root of the Repayment Defence . \n907. There was no issue between the experts that that Bank bears the burden of proving  the \nnature and extent of the harm  (although there was a debate as to who bears the b urden \nof proving the amount of the full compensation payable where it is  said t hat the  extent \nof the harm – in this case the amount of the Relevant Drawdowns – is not the same as \nthe compensation that should be paid) .  The Bank  submitted  that it is able to do so by \nestablishing that the Relevant Drawdowns were made .  It s ubmitted  that, if a Relevant \nDrawdown w as made in consequence of the  unlawful conduct of  any of the Defendants, \nthe amount of that Relevant Drawdown is harm for which that Defendant will be liable \nto make full compensation p ursuant to Article 1166 . \n908. The next t hree question s which then arise  as a matter of Ukrainian law  are the princip les \nto be applied in ascertaining (a) whether there is a sufficient causal link between the \nunlawful conduct of any one Defendant and the harm which is suffered by the \ndeprivation of property  effected by the Relevant Drawdown , (b) whether the \npresumption of fault has been rebutted and ( c) the assessment of “full  compensation ” \nincluding whether th e harm has been extinguished by the res toration to the Bank of the \nmonies paid away or their value  (which is the essence of the Repayment Defence).  \n \nArticle 1166: c au"}
{"start": 843500, "text": "ng (a) whether there is a sufficient causal link between the \nunlawful conduct of any one Defendant and the harm which is suffered by the \ndeprivation of property  effected by the Relevant Drawdown , (b) whether the \npresumption of fault has been rebutted and ( c) the assessment of “full  compensation ” \nincluding whether th e harm has been extinguished by the res toration to the Bank of the \nmonies paid away or their value  (which is the essence of the Repayment Defence).  \n \nArticle 1166: c ausal link between unlawful conduct and harm  \n909. The third element of the cause of action under Article 1166  is the existence of a causal \nlink between the unlawful conduct on which the claimant bases its claim and the harm \nwhich it contends it has su stained . It was common ground , recorded as such in the \nexperts ’ joint statement , that the Civil Code does not contain a statutory test for the \npurposes of Article 1166 and that causation is established on a case -by-case basis.  \n910. However, the common ground ended there.  Mr B eketov’s  further  evidence was that \ncausation is a question of fact  and the general question asked by the court  is whether \nthe harm would have occurred but for the unlawful conduct.   Mr Al yoshin and Mr \nNahnybida  agreed that whether a causal link exists in any given situation is ultimately \na question of fact, but they disagreed with Mr  Beketov ’s evidence as to the simple \napplication of a “but for ” test.  In their view the correct approach  under Ukrainian law \nis that , while causation will not be established if the harm would have occurred even in \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n226 \n the absence of the unlawful conduct, the causal link must be what they called “ direct , \nnecessary and inevitable ”. \n911. The main case to which Mr Beketov re ferred in his first report was the resolution of  the \nSupreme Court dated 24 April 2019  in case No. 355/1014/16 -ts, Person 1  v. Military \nProsecutor’s Office of the Central Region of Ukraine  (“Military Prosecutor’s Office ”).  \nThe case was concerned with a situation in which the military prosecution authorit ies \nwere conducting what was described as an “investigative  experiment ” within certain \ncriminal proceedings which involved them positioning  vehicles on a major highway in \na manner which blocked two lanes of traffic .  A Mercedes  belonging to (but not driven \nby) the claimant then collided with the vehicles , and another vehicle involved in the \nexperiment was also damaged .  In the proceedings which ensued, the lower courts held \nthat the behaviour of the participants in the investiga tive experiment was causally \nrelated to the damage caused to the owners of the two damaged vehicles .  The Supreme \nCourt remitted the claim for a retrial on the basis  that the local court had failed \nsufficiently to clarify the actual circumstances of the case because it came to a \npremature conclusion that only the behaviour of the investigator s was causally related \nto the damage caused to the claimants’ vehicles.  In particular the court did not establish \nwhether the driver of the Mercede s had the opportunity  to seek to avoid hitting the \nobstacle, i.e. “whether his actions were not in direct causal connection with the \nconsequences of the accident ”. \n912. In the passage cited by Mr Beketov , the Supreme Court explained the applicable \nprinciples as follows:  \n“… a causal link between the tortfeasor’s wrongdoing and the harm caused to the \ninjured party is one of the mandatory conditions for tort liability to arise. \nDetermining a causal link is necessary both to secure the interests of the injured \nparty and to exercis e the principle of good faith in ordering a person to compensate \nfor the harm inflicted.  \nA causal link between a person’s actions and the infliction of harm involves the \nharm being the consequence of that person’s wrongdoing, rather than any other \ncircumsta"}

An ordinary sequence of events must not be taken into account. An \nobjective causal  link as a condition to liability performs the function of defining an \nobjective legal limit of liability for the harmful consequences of the wrongdoing. \nA tortfeasor is not liable for any harm, but for the  harm caused by his conduct. A \nlack of causation m eans that the harm has been caused by other circumstances, \nrather than the tortfeasor’s conduct.  \nFurther, a causal link between the tortfeasor’s wrongdoing and the harm must be \ndirect, which is the case where the harm was caused by a particular conduct, \nwithout any additional factors. Where the unlawful conduct that gave rise to a \nspecific ability to inflict harm makes it real only if combined with a third party’s \nwrongful act, a legally significant causal link must be established with both the \nconduct, which gave rise to that specific ability (the conditions for inflicting the \nharm), and the acts that  made it real (the actual infliction of the harm) …”  \n913. This case was the n relied on by the Defendants as a case in which the Court had \ndetermined that only the last or intervening cause of harm could satisfy the test for \ncausation .  The way in which it was put in cross -examination was that the case  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n227 \n established that what is required is direct causation , in the sense that , if a third party’s \nact intervenes between the act of the alleged tortfeasor and the damage, then it will not \nbe possible to show direct causation.  \n914. Mr Beketov accepted that may be  the case  in particular instances,  but he did not say \nthat that was the determining consideration and  I agree with the Bank that the wording \nof the resolution in Military Prosecutor’s Office  focuses on the fact  that the courts \nbelow  failed to consider  any causal conduct by the driver of the Mercedes ; it did not \nconclude that if there were such conduct, any causal conduct by the investigator  would \nfor that reason be excluded : \n“the local court , having failed to sufficiently clarify the actual circumstances of the \ncase, … came to a premature conclusion that only the behaviour of the investigator \n… was causally related to the damage caused to the claimants ” [emphasis added]  \n915. Another way in which the Supreme Court has explained the principle appears from its \nresolution dated 2 August 2022 in case No. 908/314/18,  SI-Invest LLC  v. PJSC \nSemiconductor Plant  (“SI-Invest”) , where the issue was whether the directors and \nfounders of a debtor were liable for causing significant property harm to its creditors \nby unlawful inaction.  In its resolution the Supreme  Court used language which was \nsimilar to that used in the second paragraph of the citation from Military Prosecutor’s \nOffice I have cited above.  It concentrated at [52] on asking whether the harm was an \n“objective consequence of the conduct” of the person said to have caused the damage.  \nThe implication was that, if the harm qualified as an objective consequence of the \nconduct, it would be sufficiently direct for that purpose.  Pulling the t hreads together \nfrom those two cases, identifying the “objective consequence of the conduct ” required \nthe court to ask itself  whether the harm had been caused by other circumstances, rather \nthan the tortfeasor’s conduct.  \n916. The experts variously referred to a number of other cases  in whi"}

Pulling the t hreads together \nfrom those two cases, identifying the “objective consequence of the conduct ” required \nthe court to ask itself  whether the harm had been caused by other circumstances, rather \nthan the tortfeasor’s conduct.  \n916. The experts variously referred to a number of other cases  in which causation was \nconsidered as a matter of principle.  Thus in case No. 910/11287/16, \nTranszaliznychservice  v. Moldavian Railway  (“Transzaliznychservice ”) at [5.13] , the \nSupreme Court emphasised the need for a direct link between the unlawful act and the \ndamage , although did not develop exactly what that meant : \n“The causal link between wrongful conduct and damages is a prerequisite for \nliability. It must be proved that the wrongful conduct or omission caused  [sic] is \nthe cause, and the damages caused to the person is the consequence of such \nwrongful conduct. The tortfeasor’s unlawful conduct causes harm only when it is \ndirectly related to the harm. An indirect link between the unlawful conduct and the \nharm means th at the conduct is assessed outside the specific case and, accordingly, \nfalls outside the legally rele vant link. ” \n917. Although it is plain that, w hether a particular relationship between the unlawful conduct \nand the harm is sufficient ly direct  depends on the particular circumstances of the case , \nsome of the other authorities are a little more illuminating .  One case referred to by Mr \nBeketov was  case No. 439/1127/18 -ts, Person 1  v. Pidkaminska Village Council of \nBrodivskyi District of Lviv Region  (“Pidkaminska ”) in which the Supreme Court  used \na rather different form of wor ds when explaining  the principle s to be applied  in a claim \nbased on  the unlawful act of a village council said to have cause d moral harm  in the \nform of stress and disappointment rather than pecuniary loss .  In that context , in a \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n228 \n statement of principle  which was not questioned when the matter came back before the \nSupreme Court at a later stage,  the court used the concept of the “main reason ” leading \nto the harm.  It said:  \n“As for the content of the causal relationship, it lies in the fact that the committed \nunlawful act is the main reason that led to the infliction of moral harm. ” \n918. It also seems to be clear that the requirement for the causal relationship to be direct does \nnot carry with it any suggestion that only the immediately preceding unlawful act is \ncapable of being sufficiently direct to cause actionable harm.  This was appar ent from \nthe resolut ion of the Grand Chamber in case No. 761/45721/16 -ts, Person 1  v. Person \n4 (“PJSC Bank  Finance and Credit ”).  Mr Beketov was challenged on the way he \ndescribed this case in his report, but I think that the paragraphs of the resolution  on \nwhich he relied supported his evidence that an immediate connection between unlawful \nconduct and the harm suffered by the victim is not required.   I also think he was justified \nin saying as he did in his oral evidence that  the passages on which he relied demonstrate  \nthat the harm can be caused by both action and inaction which are unlawful .  As the \ncourt put it in that case : \n“At the same time, wrongful acts or inaction, infliction of damage and detection of \nits extent may not coincide in time. For example, individual wrongful acts or \ninaction or a combination of such acts or inaction may result in a loss of liquidity \nby the ba nk in the future. The loss of solvency of a bank that was previously solvent \nmay, in itself indicate that the bank has suffered damage.”  \n919. The same point  is also apparent from the  Supreme Court’s  resolut ion dated 20 January \n2021 in  case No. 197/1330/1"}
{"start": 854000, "text": "gful acts or inaction, infliction of damage and detection of \nits extent may not coincide in time. For example, individual wrongful acts or \ninaction or a combination of such acts or inaction may result in a loss of liquidity \nby the ba nk in the future. The loss of solvency of a bank that was previously solvent \nmay, in itself indicate that the bank has suffered damage.”  \n919. The same point  is also apparent from the  Supreme Court’s  resolut ion dated 20 January \n2021 in  case No. 197/1330/14 -u, Person 1  v. State Treasury Service of Ukraine  (“State \nTreasury ”), in which the Supreme Court said:  \n“At the same time, the causal link between the unlawful act of the tortfeasor and \nthe harm must be direct, i.e. when specific conduct without any additional factors \nhas caused the harm. Where the unlawful conduct which created the specific \npossibility of c ausing harm turns it into reality only in combination with the \nunlawful conduct of third persons, a legally significant causal link must be \nestablished both with the conduct which created the specific possibility (the \nconditions for causing harm), and with  the actions which turned it into reality (the \nactual causing of harm).”  \n920. To similar effect , and as both Mr Beketov and Mr Alyoshin agreed,  the question of \ncausation will be affected by the scope of the duty which the alleged tortfeasor has \nassumed and whether harm sustained is contemplated by the nature of the duty which \nthe alleged tortfeasor has assumed .  This is well illustrated in the situation in which the \ncourt is analys ing the responsibility for harm where there is an unlawful act by one \nperson and a n unlawful failure which may have prevented that act by another .  In case \nNo. 909/976/17,  State Environmental Inspectorate in the Ivano -Frankivsk Region  v. \nHutsulshchyna National Nature Park  (“Huts ulshchyna ”), a national park authority was \nfound liable for the harm of unlawful logging committed by a third party .  The Supreme \nCourt said : \n“Thus, the duty to ensure the protection of forest stands is assigned specifically to \npermanent forest users who are responsible for non -performance or improper \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n229 \n performance of such duties, including in case of failure to ensure the security and \nprotection of forests from unlawful tree logging. Consequently, civil liability for \nviolation of forest legislation should be borne not only by persons who directly \ncarry o ut unlawful logging (harm to trees), but also by permanent forest users, \nwhose fault lies in unlawful inaction in the form of non -performance of actions to \nensure the protection and preservation of the forest from unlawful logging on the \nplots under their jurisdiction from the forest fund lands, which has the consequence \nof unlawful logging (harm) of forest stands by third (unidentified) persons. ” \n921. Although not a resolution  of the Supreme Court , the Bank also relied on  the decision of \nthe Kyiv Appellate Court in case No. 758/5941/20, DGF  v. Person 1  (“Energobank ”).  \nThis reversed a first instance decision on which Mr Alyoshin had relied in his first \nreport as an example of a case in which the claimant had failed to prove the existence \nof a causal link between the criminal neglect of his duties by the head of a bank’s \nmanagement board and the misappropriation of the bank’s money by third parties .  The \ndecision of the Appellate Court illustrated the contrary , relying o n Ukoopspilka  as \nprovid ing a clear example of a case in which the requirement for a direct link can still \nbe established  against a person who neglects their duty , even where  the actual harm \ntook t he form of a misappropriation  by somebody else:  \n“If there is a court verdict, and the defendant has been brought to criminal liability \nfor neglect of duty, the defendant’s arguments and the court’s conclusions that only \nthose persons who t"}

Since the bank’s loss of funds and their withdrawal from the \ncorrespondent accoun t are also directly causally related to the defendant’s \nomissions, as established by the court verdict.”  \n922. The Bank submitted that Energobank  demonstrates that it is not the case that causation \ncan only be established from the immediate or last event in the chain and therefore is \nconfirmatory of the principle to be derived from  Hutsulshchyna .  It also submitted  that \nthe same actionable harm can be caused by more than one wrong, and by more than one \nwrongdoer both acting sequentially , so long as there is a sufficient nexus between the \nunlawful act and the harm .  I agree with both of those submissions , based as th ey are \non Mr Beketov’s view that the authorities demonstrate  that immediacy is not a \nrequirement to establish the necessary causal link . \n923. The Bank also relied  on the resolution  of the Grand Chamber in Ukoopspilka  (at [7.67]) \nin support of a submission  that, even where there has been intervening conduct by a \nthird party , taking the form  in that case of the improper performance of official duties \nby that bank’s curator as representative of the NBU, such conduct will not necessarily \nbreak the chain of causation .  I agree that this illustrate s the fact -sensitive enquiry which \na Ukrainian court would carry out when faced with a causation issue of  the type with \nwhich these proceedings are concerned .  It is clear from  Ukoopspilka  that the answer to \nthe question of whether the chain of causation was broken is affected by an analysis of \nwhether the relevant intervening act or omission can be regarded as a proper basis for \nexempting that bank’s defaulting officials from liability . \n924. The facts of Ukoopspilka  also demonstrate (see [7.70] to [7.72]) another aspect of what \nwould be regarded under Ukrainian law as the same  principle : a following -through of \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n230 \n the legal consequences of the avoidance of a transaction is capable of affecting the \namount recover able against those who acted  in breach of duty when causing a bank to \nenter into th at transa ction.  However , that does not of itself mean that the claimant is \nrequired to  follow through the legal consequences of the avoidance (by in that case \nfiling a refund claim against the sellers of the bonds which caused Ukoo pspilka’s  \ninsolvency) .  Whether such a step is required  bears some similarity to the circumstance s \nin which steps are required to be taken to satisfy English law principles on mitigation \nof loss ;  it will depend on all the circumstances of the case.  \n925. In Mr Kolomoisky’s written opening , it was said that it was  common ground that the \nstandard test of causation is not satisfied by an act which consists of procuring unlawful \nconduct by another person.   The point was not made in that way in closing, but I think \nthat the Bank was right to say  both that, on a proper reading of the experts’ reports , this \nwas not common  ground  and that any such submission is inconsistent with the \nauthorities I have described .

Under Ukrainian law , whether there is a legally sign ificant \ncausal link between the harm and either the conduct which created the conditions for \nharm (whether in the form o f an act o f procurement or otherwise) or the actions which \nturned it into a reality (per the Supreme Court in the State  Treasury Services  case) will \ndepend on all the circumstances of the case.  While the adjective ‘direct’ as used in the \nauthorities is an appropriate qualification to what is required, even that is not always \nused and the adjective s “immediate” and “inevitable” are not.  \n926. It follows from this that it is possible as a matter of Ukrainian law for the Individual \nDefendants  to have caused the Bank actionable harm  by their unlawful conduct, even \nif their only breach es of duty w ere acts or omi ssions  to act in a manner which procured \nor allowed the deprivations of the Bank’s property to occur  in circumstances in which \nthe execution of the relevant documentation and the making of the Relevant \nDrawdowns were given effect by others .  Likewise, it is possible as a matter of \nUkrainian law for the Corporate Defendants to have caused the Bank actionable harm, \neven though their only unlawful conduct was  assisting in the scheme initiated with the \ndeprivation of the Bank’s property  throu gh making a Relevant Drawdown, by executing \nor agreeing to execute one or more of the RSAs , and by accepting  or agreeing to accept \nreceipt of one or more of the Unreturned Prepayments.   Whether that is established \nagainst the Corporate Defendants on the facts is a matter to which I shall return later in \nthis judgment.  \n \nArticle 1190: Joint liability  \n927. The final case to which I was taken in closing by Mr Hunter was the 24 April 2014 \ndecision of the Higher Specialised Civil and Criminal Court of Ukraine (a court which \nno longer ex ists, but which had the same effective status as the Supreme Court) in case \nNo. 6-5547CB13, Gaz Ukrainy  v. Person 1 and others  (“Gaz Ukrainy ”).  Mr \nMarchukov had relied on this case as establishing that, where tortious acts were \ncommitted by a number of joint tortfeasors, the approach of the court is to look at each \nperson separat ely and determine whether that person’s conduct is sufficiently closely \nconnected to the harm for the court to be able to conclude that they caused it by their \nown unlawful conduct.  In some instances this will mean that there are a number of \nperson s who will be liable for the same loss.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n231 \n 928. Gaz Ukrainy  was a case which was primarily concerned with Article 1190 , which itself \nis concerned with compensation for damage caused by joint tortfeasors  and takes the \nfollowing form:  \n“1 Persons by whose joint actions or failure to act harm was caused shall bear joint \nand several responsibility to the victim.  \n2. Upon the application of the victim, a court may determine the responsibility of \nthe persons who jointly caused harm in a participatory share in accordance with the \ndegree of their fault.”  \n929. The experts were agreed that Article 1190 does not of itself qualify or characterise any \nconduct as unlawful.  Rather, it provides for the circumstances in which one of a number \nof defendants liable to the claimant is jointly and severally liable with othe r co-\ndefendants for the full amount of the damage suffered by the claimant.   It was also \ncommon ground, as reflected in the experts’ agreement, that for the liability of "}
{"start": 864500, "text": "patory share in accordance with the \ndegree of their fault.”  \n929. The experts were agreed that Article 1190 does not of itself qualify or characterise any \nconduct as unlawful.  Rather, it provides for the circumstances in which one of a number \nof defendants liable to the claimant is jointly and severally liable with othe r co-\ndefendants for the full amount of the damage suffered by the claimant.   It was also \ncommon ground, as reflected in the experts’ agreement, that for the liability of co -\ndefendants to be joint and several under Article 1190:  \n“… the harm must be caused by joint acts or omissions of several persons. The \ncriterion of “causing harm by joint acts or omissions” means causing “indivisible \nharm by interrelated, [cumulative / collective] actions or actions with unity of \nintent.”  \n930. The experts  also agreed in their joint statement,  that, if Art icle 1190(1) is engaged, its \neffect is that “each of the co -defendants must compensate the full amount of damages \nsuffered by the aggrieved party (as opposed to  compensating the victim only for the \nshare of harm directly attributable to their own unlawful conduct)”.   Thus , a defendant \nwho may, if considered alone, have only himself have caused a proportion of the overall \nloss suffered by the claimant may be held liable to compensate for the whole .  However \nit is still necessary for the har m to be indivisible.  \n931. The focus of this common ground was on the concept of ‘unity of intent’ as further \nexplained in the resoluti on of the Supreme Court dated 28 April 2021 in case No. \n910/12591/18, Person 1  v. DTEK Power Trade and DTEK Dniproenergo  (“DTEK ”).  \nThis case was concerned with the unlawful conduct of a process for the compulsory \npurchase of minority shareholder interests.  It was established that both the company \nacting by its supervisory board and the majority shareholders acted unlawfully in \nrelation to the purchase of the claimant’s shares at an unfair and obviously understated \nprice.  Both were held to be jointly liable as:  \n“… the claimant suffered damage due to the interrelated combined actions of the \nSupervisory Board of the joint stock company and the person making the demand \nwith the unity of intent - to buy out the shares from the claimant at an understated \nprice. Pursua nt to part one, Article 1190 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, persons \nwhose joint actions or omissions because damage are jointly and severally liable to \nthe victim.”  \n932. Initially Mr Marchukov had suggested that ‘unity of intent’ “is a high bar”, and that he \nwas not aware of any purely civil cases where the court has explained how the ‘unity \nof intent’ indicator can be established , or has been so established .  He revised that view \nwhen shown DTEK  and accepted that the concept of a high bar is not one which appears \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n232 \n in the authorities .  However, there remained a difference between the experts , because \nit was Mr Beketov’s evidence that, when harm is caused by the joint actions of several \npersons giving rise to joint and several liability under Article 1190 , the test  for causation \nis whether the joint tortfeasors' acts taken together caused harm .  The approach of Mr \nMarchukov  and Mr Nahnybida was different.  They consider ed that, while it is correct \nthat causation will not be established if the harm would have occurred e ven in the \nabsence of the unlawful conduct, court practice clearly shows that the causal link must \nalso be direct, necessary and inevitable . It follow ed that, when harm is caused by the \njoint actions of more than one person giving rise to joint and several liability under \nArticle 1190, the claimant ’s obligation to  prove all elements of liability against each \ndefendant individually, includ es the direct causal link.  \n933. Mr Marchukov explained that none of the cases to which he had been referred in cros"}

Mr Marchukov explained that none of the cases to which he had been referred in cross \nexamination show the Ukrainian courts doing what he described as eliding the test of \ncausation for tortious harm under Article 1166 with the separate question of whether \nany such liability should be borne jointly under Article  1190.   Rather, his evidence was \nthat they demonstrate that Article 1190 will apply only after each of the defendants can \nbe shown separately to have directly caused harm to the claimant , but the exten t of the \nharm caused by each defendant individually cannot be determined (i.e. , there is \nindivisible harm caused by joint actions).  \n934. Ms Montgomery submitted on behalf of Mr Bogolyubov that , if that is correct, it \ntherefore follows that a person who merely procures the unlawful acts of another cannot \nbe liable under Article 1166, since their conduct will not be the direct cause of any \nharm.   Article 1190 is irrelevant to this analysis, since the necessary prior requirements \nof Ar ticle 1166 are not made out.   This was similar to the suggestion made during the \ncourse of Mr Beketov’s cross -examination that a person who procures somebody else  \nto commit an unlawful act will not be deemed to have caused the loss jointly with that \nperson.  The case relied on for the suggestion (c ase No. 22 -ц/793/931/19  Person 1 v . \nPerson 4 , the Security Camera case),  is not authority for the proposition.   It would be \nsurprising if that were the case , because, even if a direct link is the only test for \ncausation , which it is not, it is difficult to see why both (a) the relationship between the \nprocurer and the person procured and (b) the nature of the procurement s hould not be a \nsignificant factor i n determining whether there is sufficient unity o f intent (assuming \nthat the harm is i ndivisible).  \n935. In practice , the cases which bear on the point demonstrate that  the necessary causal link , \nwhether that be  “direct” link  (Transzaliznychservice ), “the main reason”  \n(Pidkaminska ), “an objective consequence”  (SI-Invest ) or in any other way , was \nsatisfied in relation to the entirety of the loss suffered by a claimant suing two or more \ndefendants  all of whom had committed  separate and distinct unlawful acts.  Whether \nthat was because the defendants had both,  individually, caused that loss, or because the \ntwo of them taken together had caused it, the end result was the same.  \n936. However, t he Bank submitted that, as a matter of logic  there was sense in Mr Beketov’s \nevidence  that the causation analysis should be performed collectively , because it is \ncommon ground that , for the purposes of Article 1190(1)  ‘causing harm by joint acts \nor omissions’  means causing “indivisible harm by interrelated, [cumulative/collective] \nactions or actions with unity of intent” , which (per Gaz Ukrainy ) extends to occasions \nwhen it is impossible to determine “what action and to which extent caused the \noccurrence of that consequence” , language also used by the Grand Chamber in its more \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n233 \n recent re solution in  case No. 372/1652/18, Pobutrembudmaterialy L LC \n(“Pobutrembudmaterialy ”).  I think there is real force in the submission, supported as \nit is by Mr Beketov’s evidence that, if liability under Article  1190 extends to situations \nwhere it is “impossible to determine what action and to wh ich extent caused” the harm, \nthen it follows  that the element of causation must be cons"}

This language from Gaz Ukrainy  goes rather further than the limitation to “extent” \nsuggested by Mr Marchukov.  I do not think that this is eliding the test of causation for \ntortious harm under Article 1166 with the separate question of whether any such \nliability should be borne jointly under Article 1190.  However, I do think that the real \npoint which comes out of Gaz Ukrainy  and Pobutrembudmaterialy  is ultimately an \nevidential one.   In my judgment, the evidence establishes that, where the harm is \nindivisible , and there is sufficient uni ty of intent as to the interrelated and cumulative \nor collective unlawful conduct, each of the tortfeasors will be jointly liable to \ncompensate the victim for the harm caused by that conduct . \n938. In the present case that would be  established against each of the Individual Defendants, \nif their conduct in connection with the operation of the loan recycling scheme and the \nduties they breached as members of the Supervisory Board were sufficiently inter -\nconnected  and undertaken towards the same ultimate end, to satisfy this test.   In \nprinciple, it may also extend to others involved in the Misappropr iation (such as the  \nmembers of the Management Board  who participated in the operation of the scheme in \nbreach of duty to the Bank), but that is n ot a matter for determination in these \nproceedings , nor has it been suggested by any of the Defendants that , merely because \nothers might have acted unlawfully as well , that in any way affects either their own \nliability to compensate the Bank for the harm caused by their unlawful conduct or the \namount of compensation for which they are liable.  \n939. As to the position of the Corporate Defendants, I consider that the correct analysis is \nthat, if their unlawful conduct was part of the same scheme for the extraction of funds \nfrom the Bank and the movement of those funds out of Ukraine into foreign currency, \nas the scheme to which the Individual Defendants were party , they may all  be liable  for \nthe harm caused by that conduct .  In theory this might  be the case if and to the extent \nthat their participation was agreed by them before the Relevant Drawdowns were made \nand was all part of a single wider scheme in respect of which it can be said that the \nBank suffered indivisible harm by interrelated and cumulative or collective actions of \neach of t he Defendants with unity of intent.  \n940. However, this is an aspect of the case on which the Corporate Defendants stressed that \nit is very important to  focus with some care both on (a) the nature and extent of  the \nharm which their conduct is said to have caused the Bank and (b) the precise nature of \nthe allegations made against them ; it is at the core of their  case that the acts and \nomissions of which they are accused  have no causal link to the harm sustained by the \nBank in the form of the Relevant Drawdowns , a state of affairs which the Bank can not \nsave by the application of Article 1190 . \n \nArticle 1166: fault \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n234 \n 941.

The consequence of this is that, while  the absence of fault  can be relied \nupon by the defendant as a defence to a claim in tort, he bear s the burden of proof  to \nestablish that he was not at fault.  It was also clear from  Bank Daniel  that in that context \n(i.e., negligent breaches of duty by officer s of a bank) the Defendant s must  prove the \nabsence of any fault  by showing they took all possible measures and actions to prevent \nharm to the claimant . \n942. It is not alleged by any of the Defendants that they can rebut the presumption of fault if \nthe allegations of unlawful conduct made against them are established by the Bank.   It \nfollows that this final element of the cause of action does not give rise to an additional \nrequirement that the Bank is unable to satisfy in the present case.  \n \nArticle 1166: full compensation  \n943.

It is clear from the wording of the Article that the full \ncompensation is for the harm caused by the unlawful act  on which the Bank relies , \nwhich , as the Bank stressed on a number of occasions is the making of the Relevant \nDrawdowns pursuant to Relevant Loans which were void .  The loan agreements for the \nRelevant Loans  simply provided what Mr Hunter called the paperwork pretext for the \nextraction of funds.  \n944. The compensation claimed by the Bank is the amount of money which will put the Bank \nfully back into the position it would have been in, but for the fraudulent extractions of \nits money.  It is not asserting a proprietary claim requiring it to establish that the \nUnreturned Prepayments were made to the Corporate Defendants from funds drawn \ndown under the Relevant Loans (see the discussion of the Bank’s case in the judgment \nof the Court of Appeal on th e jurisdiction challenges ( JSC Commercial Bank \nPrivatbank  v. Kolomoisky and others  [2019] EWCA Civ 1708, [2020] Ch 783 at [222] \nto [228], which remains unchanged).  It follows that the compensation it seeks does not \ndepend on showing a tracing link between  the Relevant Drawdowns and the Unreturned \nPrepayment.  This was always accepted by Mr Kolomoisky whose written closing \nsubmissions put the point as follows:  \n“It is common ground (at least between the Forensic Accountants) that the making \nof an [Unreturned Prepayment] by a Borrower to a [Corporate Defendant] did not \nof itself cause the Bank a loss.  The amount of the [Unreturned Prepayment] is \nsimply the amount  which the Bank claims was misappropriated.”  \n945. It follows that, a s the experts were agreed that deprivation of money amounts to harm \nfor the purposes of establishing tortious liability, the amount of the Relevant \nDrawdowns is the amount of the harm for which it is entitled to full compensation; that \nis the  initial financial loss sustained by the Bank.  It was then submitted, in my view \ncorrectly , that if a sum of money is misappropriated , the immediate loss is that s um, \nbut, by the time the court comes to assess the full compensation payable , the loss m ay \nbe more or less depending on what has happened in the meantime .  It might be more if \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n235 \n as a consequence of the immediate loss to the victim the victim loses opportunities to \nmake profits or has additional expenses.

It might be less if the defendant has provided \ngenuine compensation for the victim , or if the victim has been able to mitigate its loss \nin some recognisable manner . \n946. It also follows that what the court is called upon to do when quantifying the amount \nrequired by the Bank to compensate it for the harm is to consider, as at the date of \nassessment, what amount of money will put the Bank back into the position it would \nhave been i n but for the Relevant Drawdowns.  And, in making that assessment, the \ncourt will have regard to what has happened after and in consequence of the unlawful \nconduct, ignoring matters which fall to be disregarded as a matter of law, such as the \nuse o f the funds by the fraudsters to pay off their liabilities.   I will come back to consider \ncompensation on the facts in the context of my findings on the Repayment Defence, but \nthere are a few points of legal principle which it is convenient to deal with at this stage.   \n947. The first legal issue which arose related to the burden of proof.  It was said by the Bank \nthat it is for the Defendants to establish on the facts that, in the period which followed \nthe Relevant Drawdowns , they took steps which, as a matter of substance and reality, \nprovided compensation for the harm they caused .  The Bank's position is that the \nDefendants have wholly failed to do that, because they simply rely on cover -ups which \nprovided no value to the Bank . \n948. Mr Beketov, Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida all addressed the question of burden in a \nnumber of different contexts.  It is apparent that Ukrainian law, like English law, \nrecognises that there are instances in which the burden is a matter of evidence and other  \ninstances in which the burden is a matter of substantive law.  Generally speaking, \nhowever, the starting point is that each party bears the burden of proving facts and \nmatters on which they wish to rely.  \n949. I agree with the Bank that, whether the burden of proof is to be characterised as an \nevidential question (and therefore governed by English law), or a matter of substantive \nlaw (and therefore governed by the law of Ukraine), the answer is the same.  Once t he \nBank has established actionable harm (in the form of the Relevant Drawdowns), the \nburden is on the Defendants to show that credit should be given for any receipt by the \nBank which reduces the loss.   In this case the Defendants have always said that the \nreduction of the loss is achieved by repayment of the loan if the Relevant Loan was \nvalid or discharge of the restitutionary obligation if the Relevant Loan was void .  But \nin my judgment the burden is on them to prove that the facts on which they rely had \nthat effect as a matter of Ukrainian law.  \n950. This conclusion on  burden is a straightforward application  of the experts ’ agreement in \ntheir joint statem ent that “each party generally bears the burden of proving facts and \nmatters upon which they wish to rely”.  It also seems to me that it  does not just reflect \nthe law of Ukraine.  It is consistent with the approach reflected in Midco Holdings Ltd \nv. Piper  [2004] EWCA Civ 476 at [23 -24] and Cheltenham BC v. Laird  [2009] EWHC \n1253 (QB) at [561] .  In my view the following statement by Bryan J in Yurov  at [1182] \nis equally applicable in the present case:  \n“The Bank having prima facie  established its loss one would expect that the burden \nof proof would shift to the Shareholders to establish any case by way of rebuttal in \nterms of benefits to be credited and the like.

Secondly, it is right to record that t he experts were unable to refer to any Ukrainian case \nin which a tort claim has been brought seeking compensation for the misappropriation \nof monies using the mechanism of unlawful loans  where (i) the proceeds of the fraud \nwere used to repay earlier unlawful loans and/or (ii) the unlawful loans were recorded \nas repaid by later fraudulent loans .  The closest that the Supreme Court has got to \nconsidering analogous circumstances is Ukoopspilka , (the relevant parts of which  are \ndiscussed in paragraph 923 and 924 above),  in which the DGF made claims against \nBank officials who had allowed their banks to enter into fraudulent and ‘risky’ \ntransactions (the purchase of junk bonds) which led  to insolvency.  The Grand Chamber \nfound that, on the facts of the case, there would have been no point in the DGF pursuing \nclaims against the sellers of the bonds  to mitigate its loss .  I agree with the Bank’s \nsubmission that it  appears from the Supreme C ourt’s approach that the compensable \nloss for the purpose s of Art icle 1166 was regarded as quite different from the value of \nthe restitutionary claims, and f ell to be assessed as a matter of fact.  \n952. Thirdly, there was no substantial dispute between the parties that the assessment of full \ncompensation is an assessment of fact for the court, nor was there any real argument \nagainst the proposition that full compensation means restitutio in integrum  or \nsomething similar.  It is the sum of money needed to make the Bank whole and put it \nfully back in the position it would have been in but for the wrongdoing.   That is the \nexercise which can be done using the Bank ’s methodology, the results of which were \nquantified by Mr Thompson.  It is not achieved by Mr Davidson’s funds flow approach , \nwhich seeks to conduct a funds flow tra cing exercise which will lead to different results \nfrom th at achieved by Mr Thompson ’s matching of Relevant Drawdowns to Unreturned \nPrepayments with the use of the Bank’s transactional data.  \n953. The Bank also submitted and I accept  that i n approaching that question a Ukrainian \ncourt will also be guided not just by the clear meaning of the phrase “full compensation” \nbut also by the associated principles of  general application  including, justice, good faith, \nreasonableness (Article 3(1)(6) of the Civil Code) and of protecting a victim's rights  \n(Article 15).   Mr Alyoshin did not really address this aspect of the test , but looked at \noverall I think it is clear that , when working out full compensation u nder Ukrainian law, \nthe court is required to make a factual assessment taking what Mr Hunter called “a real \nworld view, looking at the substance”.  This means that, taken together with the burden \nof proof, the Defendants must prove that what they did provi ded real benefit to the Bank \nsufficient to amount to full or partial compensation for the extraction of money pursuant \nto the Relevant Drawdowns .

In other words, the question is whether, as a matter of \nsubstance and reality, the Defendants are able to est ablish that compensation for the \nharm caused by the Relevant Drawdowns has been provided to the Bank.  In answering \nthat question, the court is required to consider whether the Bank has received such sum \nof money as is required to make it whole, and put it  fully back in the position it would \nhave been in but for the wrongdoing . \n \nVoid and voidable contracts : an introduction  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n237 \n 954. The question of whether  or not a transa ction is void as a matter of Ukrainian law is not \nof itself relevant to the question of wh ether any of the Defendants acted unlawfully for \nthe purpose of Article 1166.  It is however relevant to two other  issues.  The first is the \nRepayment Defence.   Nobody says that the legal analysis of how the Repayment \nDefence works is unaffected by the question of whether the transactions given effect \nboth by the Relevant Drawdowns and by the New and Intermediary Loans were or we re \nnot void .  However, the parties dis agree as to whether the difference in legal analysis \naffects the efficacy  of the Repayment Defence , and if so how . \n955. The second issue affected by the application of Ukrainian law principles as to voidness \nand voidability  of transactions  is the claim in restitution against the Corporate \nDefendants .  The question of whether the transactions initiated by the Relevant \nDrawdowns are void is relevant to the issue  of whether the Bank has established that \nthere was no lawful basis  for the transfers  made as a result of the Relevant Drawdowns \nand in respect of the Unreturned Prepayments .  In that context , the Corporate \nDefendants d eveloped an argument that it would be wrong for this court to determine \nthe questio n in the absence of the Borrowers , which were parties to the Relevant Loans \nand RSAs and were recipients of the Relevant Drawdowns, but  which are not parties to \nthese proceedings .  Although s ubmissions to this effect were only made by the \nCorporate Defendants , if the point  is a good one it affects the conduct of the proceedings \nmore generally  because the outcome has some bearing on those aspects of the Bank’s \ncase against the Individual Defendants which depend on the question of whether or not \na Relevant Loan is void.  It is therefore appropriate to consider  the point at this stage \nrather tha n in the context of explaining my conclusions on the claim against them in \nunjust enrichment.  \n956. The way that the point was put in the  Corporate Defendants’ closing submissions was \nthat, w hatever its governing law, the unjust enrichment claim s depend upon establishing \nthat the Relevant Loans and RSAs are all void.  It was not in dispute th at the is sue of \nwhether or not the Relevant Loans and RSAs are void is governed by Ukrainian law, as \nthey are all contracts governed by Ukrainian law.  However , it was said that they can \nonly be found to be void in legal proceedings to which the Borrowers (being parti es to \nthem ) are party .  Despite the fact that expert evidence of Ukrainian law was adduced \non this point, it was common ground by the end of the trial that questions of joinder are \ntreated by both English and Ukrainian law  as matters of procedure, so the question of \nwhether there is any substance in this point is a matter of English law . \n957.

For this reason, it is not necessary to discuss what the position would be in Ukraine if \nthe point was governed by Ukrainian law.  Nonetheless, I shall give a brief description \nof the experts’ positions on the point , because it puts in its proper context the conclusion \nI have reached that it is appropriate for the court to make findings as to voidness , \nnotwithstan ding the absence of the Borrowers.   \n958. Mr Beketov’s opinion was that Ukrainian court practice demonstrates that there is no \nreason why the court cannot proceed to determine a claim in unjust enrichment , which \ndepends on a transaction being void , without joining all of the parties to the transaction.  \nIn his view, the proper defendants to the Bank’s unjust enrichment claim are those \nalleged to have acquired or preserved the property, and there is no requirement for every \nperson through whose hands  the property has passed (in this case the Borrowe rs) to be \njoined, merely because the court is required to determine that the transaction was void \nas part of its determination of the claim against the acquirer.  That would only be \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n238 \n necessary if relief was also being sought against those persons, which in this case it is \nnot.  \n959. Furthermore, Mr Beketov explained that the only consequence of non -joinder is that \nfindings of fact will not have preclusive effect as against non -parties, which is a reason \nfor joinder, but which does not affect the ability of the court to proceed against  a party \nwho has been joined on the basis that the transaction is void.  He also expressed the \nview that, where a transaction is void, the legal consequences of that state of affairs are \na matter of law and cannot be changed by agreement between the partie s.  As the Bank \nsubmitted in its closing submissions, given that a void transaction is invalid by \noperation of law, its invalidity cannot be affected by the presence or absence of parties \nto the proceedings.  The court is not being asked to declare the inv alidity of any \ntransaction, it is simply being asked to grant relief against persons who are parties to \nthe proceedings.  None of what he had to say was inconsistent with his acceptance in \ncross -examination by Mr Plewman that, i f a Ukrain ian court was addr essing these \nclaims, and if third parties are affected, they should be joined in the proceedings and, if \nthey are not, they may be able to lodge an appeal . \n960. Mr Alyoshin disagreed.  He cited the resolution of the Supreme Court in case No. \n917/2041/20, Novye Mosty LLKC v. Liutenka Village Council  in support of his \nargument that, as a matter of Ukrainian law, a transaction is either valid or invalid.  It \ncannot be treated as valid as between the parties to the transaction but invalid for the \npurpose of claims between other parties: “Thus the Bank’s  claims cannot succeed \ninsofar as they depend on the court making determination that transactions are invalid, \nwhere t he parties to those transactions are not before the court” . \n961. In their closing submissions, counsel for the Corporate Defendants  did not contend that \nwhat Mr Alyoshin had to say was also the position which this court should adopt.   Their \nargument was rather different.  They  said that there are two good reasons why the court \nshould not make any finding as to voidness in the absence of the Borrowers : \ni) The Corporate Defendants  would be exposed to double liability if a finding as \nto voidness is made by which the Borrowers are not bou"}

Their \nargument was rather different.  They  said that there are two good reasons why the court \nshould not make any finding as to voidness in the absence of the Borrowers : \ni) The Corporate Defendants  would be exposed to double liability if a finding as \nto voidness is made by which the Borrowers are not bound .  The double liability \nto which they referred was  liability in unjust enrichment in these proceedings \non the basis that the contracts are void, and liability in contract on the basis that \nthe RSAs are not void.  \nii) There is a  risk of i nconsistent judgments  on the basis that c ontractual liability \nunder the RSAs has  already been established in the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings, \nand if that is to be undermined in a later action , then the Borrowers must \nproperly be party to that action.   It was submitted that, n otwithstanding the \nBank’s allegations that th e judgments in the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings  were \ncollusively obtained, they still  stand and the Bank (which was a party to them) \nhas made no attempt to have them set asid e. It was submitted that this court \nshould not entertain an argument that could give rise to inconsistent judgments \nwhich they said would be  “a potential disaster from the legal point of view ” to \nadopt the language  of Brandon LJ in Aratra Potato Co v . Egyptian Navigation \nCo (The “El Amria ”) [1981] 2 Lloyd’s Rep  119, 128(2) . \n962. It was also submitted that, in the absence of exceptional circumstances,  A (in this case \nthe Bank)  cannot seek declaratory relief as to the meaning of a contract between B and \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n239 \n C (in this case the  RSAs between  Borrowers and the Corporate Defendants) (Federal \nMogul Personal Injury Trust v . Federal Mogul  Ltd [2014] Lloyd’s Rep IR 671 at [94 ].  \nThus it was said that A should equally not be entitled to seek a determination that the \ncontract between B and C is void, at least in the absence of both B and C.   In my view \nthis case does not assist in circumstances in which it is relevant to the determination of  \nA’s personal cause of action in tort or restitution against C for A to establish that  \ncontracts between A and B and/or between  B and C are void.  That would only be \nrelevant if the court was being asked to grant declaratory relief against B, which is not \nthe case in the current proceedings.  \n963. On the same theme , the Bank ’s principal response to th e Corporate Defendants’ \nsubmissio n was that the causes of action it pursues are personal claims in tort and unjust \nenrichment .  They are not  claim s in rem ( as to which it cited Pattni v . Ali [2007] 2 AC \n85 at [21] to [25] ), and therefore the joinder of parties against whom no relief is sought \nin these proceedings is  unnecessary .  That is correct so far as it goes, and seems to me \nto be an answer to the Corporate Defendants’ argument based on Federal Mogu l but it \ndoes not really engage with the points made by the Corporate Defendants as to double \nliability  and risk of inconsistent judgments . \n964. As the Corporate Defendants do not contend that, as a matter of law, the court is \ndisabled from granting the relief sought by the Bank because the Borrowers have not \nbeen joined as parties , the current position is that it is no longer said  that there is any \nlegal bar to the issue  of voidness being determined in the ir absence .  It is also accepted \nby both the Bank and the Corporate Defendants that the Borrowers will not be bound \nby this court’s determinations  (a position which seems to me to be correct) .

It therefore \nfollows that t he points made by the  Corporate Defendants  are ultimately all about \nwhether the risk of double liability and prejudice to the Corporate Defendants from \ninconsist ent judgments , mean that , in the interests of justice, the case cannot proceed . \n965. I accept that the risk of double liability and prejudice to the Corporate Defendants from \ninconsistent judgments is capable of being a factor which the court can take into account \nwhen determining case management issue s before and during the course of the trial.  \nHowever, the Corporate Defendants never applied to join the Borrowers , and nor did \nthe Borrowers themselves apply to be joined, a course which was always open to them \nif they were really concerned about either of these two points , once it was appar ent from \nthe Court of Appeal’s decision on jurisdiction that these proceedings would be \ncontinuing in England.  The fact that they did not do so, doubtless for what they \nregarded as good reasons of their own , means that it is difficult to give this argument \nmuch weight at this stage of the proceedings, more especially now that it is apparent \nthat the point is  one of procedure not substantive law.  \n966. I also take into account  the finding I have made that the Borrowers and the Corporate \nDefendants are all ultimately co ntrolled by the Individual Defendants, a factor which \nminimises any risk that double liability or inconsistent judgments might operate  to as \nto inflict genuine prejudice on either the Corporate D efendants , or indeed the \nBorrowers .  This conclusion is fortified by my finding that the judgments in the 2014 \nUkrainian Proceedings were collusively obtained.   For all of these reasons I reject the \nCorporate Defendants’ submissions on this point . \n \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n240 \n Void and voidable contracts : the principle s of Ukrainian law  \n967. The starting point is that, t o the extent that a Relevant Loan, a Relevant Drawdown or \nan Unreturned Prepayment qualifies as a transaction under Ukrainian law (as to which \nit must be  a unilateral, bilateral or multilateral act aimed at the acquisition, alteration or \ntermination of civil rights and obligations: Article 202 of the Civil Code ), it will not be \nvalid unless it complies with the requirements of Article 203 of the Civil Code .  The \nrequirements of Article  203 are as follows:  \n“General requirements to be observed for a transaction to be valid  \n1. The content of a transaction may not be in conflict with this Code or other civil \nstatutes or state or public interests or public morals.  \n2. A party to a transaction must have the necessary civil capacity.  \n3. The expression of will by a party to a transaction must be free and correspond to \nhis inner will.  \n4. A transaction must be executed in a form prescribed by law.  \n5. A transaction must be aimed at causing the legal effect contemplated thereby.  \n6. A transaction executed by parents (whether blood or adoptive) may not conflict \nwith the rights and interests of their minor, underage or incapable children.”  \n968. It is also necessary to identify the true transaction, because , if the transaction was \nconcluded by the parties for the purposes of  concealing another transaction   (which the \nparties in fact concluded ), Article 235 of the Civil Code (“Article 235”) treats it as a \nsham or mock transaction with the consequence that “the relations between the parties \nshall be governed by the rules applicable to such actual transaction.”   At one stage it \nseemed to be the Bank’s case that Artic"}

It is also necessary to identify the true transaction, because , if the transaction was \nconcluded by the parties for the purposes of  concealing another transaction   (which the \nparties in fact concluded ), Article 235 of the Civil Code (“Article 235”) treats it as a \nsham or mock transaction with the consequence that “the relations between the parties \nshall be governed by the rules applicable to such actual transaction.”   At one stage it \nseemed to be the Bank’s case that Article 235 itself gave rise to an indep endent ground \non which contracts  that were part of the Misappropriation were void.  That was not the \nway in which the argument was put in closing, and in the event there seemed to be a \nmeasure of agreement between the parties as to the correct analysis . \n969. I am satisfied that the evidence establishes that, as a matter of Ukrainian law, where a \ntransaction of one type is disguised as a transaction of another type, the court  is required \nto look at the rules which are applicable to the true or real transaction.   It follows that, \nif what purports to have been a loan was not in fact a loan , but rather was a transfer of \nmoney for no  consideration with intent to misappropriate, the court will treat the \ntransfer as having the characteristics of the true transaction when determining its \nvalidity and effect .  That will include questions as to whether, having regard to its true \nnature and cha racteristic s, the real transaction  is valid, voidable or void.  \n970. In a case in which the invalidity of a transaction is established by law, Article 215 of \nthe Civil Code (“Article 215”) provides that it will be null and void an d it is not required \nto be held invalid by a court.   In any such instance, an invalid transaction “entails no \nlegal consequences , other than those connected with the invalidity” which may include \nan obligation to return in kind everything the recipient has received pursuant to the \ninvalid transaction or , where that is impossible , to compensate the t ransfer or for the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n241 \n value of everything it has received  together with an obligation to compensate any party \nwho has suffered damages or moral damage in connection with the execution of the \ninvalid transaction  (Article 216  of the Civil Code (“Article 216”) ).  In  language , the \naccuracy of which I accept, Mr Beketov said:  \n“A void transaction will have only the legal consequences associated with its \ninvalidity, such as restitution of property passing under that transaction pursuant to \nArticle 216(1) of the Civil Code, and liability in damages pursuant to Article 216(2) \nof the Civil Code.”  \n971. In any case in which the invalidity of a transaction is not expressly established by law, \nbut a party to the transaction or a third party challenges its validity on particular \ngrounds, it will be voidable  (Article 215(3) ).  It was common ground that  once declared \ninvalid by the court , the transaction will be invalid ab initi o rather  than from the t ime \nof the court’s declaration.   It was also common ground that t here is a statutory \npresumption that a transaction is lawful unless its invalidity is expressly established by \nlaw or it is held to be invalid by the court (Article 204 of the Civil Code ) and that doubts \nregarding the validity or enforceability of a t ransaction should be resolved in favour of \nit being valid, of legal effect and enforceable .   \n972. The main provision relied on by the Bank in support of its case on the a voidance of \ntransaction s is Article 228, which takes the following form:  \n“Legal consequences of execution of a transaction that is contrary to the public \npolicy and has been executed with an aim that is in conflict with the interests of the \nstate and the public  \n1.

In the event of failure to satisfy the requirement that a transaction must meet \nstate or public interests or public morals, such transaction may be held invalid. \nWhere a transaction that has been held invalid by court was executed with an aim \nthat was k nowingly in conflict with state or public interests, then, if it was the \nintention of the parties (provided that such transaction was carried out by both \nparties), the court must order that everything they have received under such \ntransaction be transferre d to the state budget or, if the transaction was carried out \nby one party, the court must order that everything the other party has received be \ntransferred to the state budget and that everything the other party owes be \ntransferred to the former party by c ourt judgment as a recovery for everything so \nreceived. Where it was the intention of one party only, everything such party has \nreceived under such transaction must be returned to the other party, and everything \nthat has been received by, or owed to, the l atter must be transferred to the state \nbudget by court judgment.”  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n242 \n 973. The experts were agreed that the effect of Art icle 228(2) is that a transaction which is \nconsidered to be contrary to public policy (or what in its literal translation is also called \npublic order) in the circumstances identified in Article 228(1) is void.  They also agreed \nthat, in order to violate Article 228(1),  the transaction in question either must infringe \nthe constitutional rights and freedoms of an individual and citizen (which was not the \nway in which the Bank put its case) or must destroy , damage or misappropriate the \nproperty of  amongst others an individual or a legal entity  (which was) . \n974. As all of the experts accepted, the language of Article 228(1) focuses on the aim of the \ntransaction sought to be impugned, which requires consideration of the intent of one or \nboth of the parties to the transaction .  It is therefore  necessary for one or more of the \nparties to the transaction to have known that it was contrary to public policy and to have \nintended or willingly accepted those harmful effects.  This would include a transaction \ndirected at one of the listed aims, namely the misappropriation of  the property of a \ncompany or an individual, or as Mr Alyoshin put it,  a “transaction aimed at taking \nsomebody’s possession in an illegal way”.  \n975. In light of the way that  Mr Kolomoisky’s case was advanced  in his written closing, I \nshould record that,  on the question of  intent , I am satisfied that what is required for a \ntransaction to be void as contrary to public policy is for “one or more of the parties to \nhave known (actually  or constructively) that the transaction was contrary to public \npolicy and to have intended or willingly accepted those harmful effects ”.  It is \nconfirmed in a number of cases in the Supreme Court  (see e.g., the facts of  case N o. \n910/1734/19,  MTIBU  v. Alfa-Garant Insurance Co (“MTIBU ”) and case No. \n924/588/20, Tigerfish LLC  v. Free Energy LLC  (“Tigerfish ”) and most rece"}

The experts were also agreed that, whether a transaction violates public policy is \ndetermined on a case -by-case basis, a proposition established by the resolut ion of the \nSupreme Court in  case No. 911/2574/18 , JSC Chornomornaftogaz  v. Ukratomenergo  \nLLC (“Chornomornaftogaz ”).  In their  joint statement , the experts said that, wh at the \ncourt  is considering when asked to  determin e whether a transaction is contrary to public \npolicy is  (i) the purpose of the transaction, (ii) the state or public interests which the  \ntransaction violates, (iii) the danger which the  transaction poses to such interests, and \n(iv) the intentions of the parties . \n977. The fact that a transaction contrary to public policy in the sense described above will \nbe void is to be contrasted with a failure to satisfy the requirement that a transaction \nmust meet state or public interests or public morals .  The language of Article 228(3)  \nmakes clear that , where  that is established , any such transaction may be held invalid .  \nThe evidence established that this meant that any such transaction  would then be  \nvoidable  and (as I have already explain ed) where the court declares it to be  contrary to \npublic interests or public morals will be invalid ab initio . \n978. At the outset of the trial, t here was  disagreement between the experts as to whether it \nwould be open to a Ukrainian court to conclude that the parties to the Relevant Loans \nintended to breach public policy in the absence of a criminal conviction.   Initially Mr \nAlyoshin maintained a position which was expressed in slightly different terms during \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n243 \n the course of his evidence, but which can be summarised as being that “nothing short \nof evidence of guilt in committing crimes suffices for holding contracts void under \nArticle 228(1)”.  Having then been taken during the course of his oral evidence to a \nnumber of resolution s of the Supreme Court which appeared to be impossible to \nreconcile with this conclusion ( Kakhova , MTIBU  and the resolution of the Gran d \nChamber dated 2 November 2021 in case No. 917/1338/18 , Person 1  v. Private \nEnterprise Agro firma Slavu tych (“Agrofirma  Slavutych ”), the latter two of which were \nresolution s of the Grand Chamber), he modified his opinion so that the principle which \nhe said applied was that the following was the general practice of the Ukrainian court:  \n“As soon as the issue comes to the embezzlement, misappropriation of money from \nbanking -- banks, from financial institutions, Article 228 apply in a way that it \nshould be preceded with the verdict of the criminal court.”  \n979. Although this point had fallen away by the time of closing submissions, it is  another \nexample of  an instance in which  Mr Alyoshin adopted a rather adversarial position in \nhis evidence, which seemed to me to have more in common with an advocate arguing \nhis client’s case than it did with an expert explaining to the court his dispassionate view \nof the law of Ukraine .

Although this point had fallen away by the time of closing submissions, it is  another \nexample of  an instance in which  Mr Alyoshin adopted a rather adversarial position in \nhis evidence, which seemed to me to have more in common with an advocate arguing \nhis client’s case than it did with an expert explaining to the court his dispassionate view \nof the law of Ukraine .  As I have already explained earlier in this judgment  (see \nparagraph 810 above) , I also agree with the Bank’s description of his evi dence as \nevasive when he was asked about w hich of the relevant authorities on the point he had \nconsidered before his reports were prepared.  I n the event , in the closing submission s \nprepared on behalf of Mr Kolomoisky , it was  said that he accepted the Bank’s argument \nthat, like the similar issue I discussed in paragraph 850 above, the issue was only an  \neviden tial one, and t herefore conceded that  any Ukrainian rules in this regard would not \napply in English proceedings.  \n980. This concession meant that the point was not pursued as a matter of substance in \nclosing , but it was still asserted on behalf  of Mr Kolomoisky  that there was  unfairness \nin the fact that he has been deprived of the opportunity even to argue th e point as a \nresult of the  Bank’s decision to engage in what he described as  an extreme form of \nforum -shopping.   In the light of that commen t, I should say that, even if that concession \nhad not been made, I would still have preferred Mr Beketov’s evidence to the effect \nthat Mr Alyoshin’s description of what he said was the general practice of the Ukrainian \ncourt was not an accurate reflection of Ukrainian law, and that no criminal prosecution \nor verdict is required.   I can explain why quite shortly . \n981. In my view the resolution s of the Grand Chamber in MTIBU  and Agrofirma  Slavutych  \nsupport th e proposition  that no criminal prosecution or verdict is required , and the \napproach has  recently been followed in Tigerfish and Prezenta  Premium  at [4.1] , \namongst others.  Mr Alyoshin relied on the resolutions of the Supreme Court dated 8 \nAugust 2019 in  case No. 2a-12868/12/2670 , State Tax Inspectorate  v. Ant Yapi LLC \nand 17 August 2023 in case No. 904/3100/21,  State Innovative Financi al and Credit \nInstitution  v. JSC Commercial Bank Concord , which on one view contain statements \nwhich appear to go the other way .  Howeve r, I agree with the Bank’s conclusion , based \nas it is on Mr Beketov’s evidence , that they are explicable on the grounds that the \nclaimant relied on the very existence of a criminal investigation to est ablish a violation \nof public policy.  In that context, and in the absence of a n allegation of civil \nunlawfulness, it is not surprising that the Supreme Court held that a conviction was \nrequired . \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n244 \n 982. I also think that Mr Beketov was right to conclude that Chornomornaftogaz  establishes \nthat there is no requirement for an impugned transaction to involve the state or other \npublic entity, or for it to threaten the social and economic foundations of the state, in \norder for it to be contrary to public policy within the meaning of Article  228(1).  I accept \nthat he is right in his conclusion that a sufficient public or state interest will arise when \nthe transaction involves an infringement of property rights.  As the Supreme Court \nexplained in  case No. 0907/17918/2012 , Bank Zoloti Vorota  PJSC  v. Person 1 , a case \nconcerned with a fraudulent extraction of funds for the benefit of its former employees:  \n“Taking into account the above circumstances, the loan agreement dated 7 May \n2008 was concluded for the purpose of taking illegal possession of bank funds  \n[…] \nIn view of the foregoing, loan agreement No. 02/355, dated 7 May 2008, and made \nbetween Zoloti Vorota Bank (a commercial bank "}

The Bank also relied on Article 52 in support of its case on invalidity.  This article \nprovides  that, with effect from 8 March 2015  “agreements concluded by the bank with \nrelated parties on terms that are not current market terms shall be declared invalid from \nthe moment of their conclusion”.  Before that date  the language was slightly different \nand provided that “agreements concluded by the bank with related parties on terms \nmore favourable than usual are declared by the court as invalid from the moment of \ntheir conclusion ”. \n984. It was common ground that the earlier version of Article 52  provided for agreements in \nbreach of its provisions to be voidable but not void.  The issue between the experts was \nwhether the amended version changed the law and rendered such agreements void \nwithout any need for intervention by a court.  Mr Beketov said that this was what the \namendment achieved  by the removal of any reference to the court .  Mr Alyoshin said \nthat it did not , because the language still required a declaration . \n985. There was no case law on this point, but Mr Beketov’s opinion was supported by \nMary na Sayenko  in an article published in Yuryst & Zakon Issue No 12 in which the \nauthor said:  \n“The lawmakers changed slightly the approach to the evaluation of transactions \nand agreements carried out by related parties. Although the pre -amended version \nof the Ukrainian Law on Banks and Banking specified that transactions entered \ninto between the ban k and related parties on the terms, which are more favourable \nthan ordinary terms, could have been invalidated by the court ab initio , meaning \nthat they could be challenged, the new wording of Article 52 of the Law says that \ntransactions entered into by t he bank and related parties on the terms, which are not \ncurrent market terms, are invalidated ab initio . Thus, the above wording can be \nconstrued by the regulator as voidance of such agreements as provided by the Law, \nresulting in a new wave of actions brought by interested parties .” \n986. Mr Alyoshin  said that the retention of the  phrase  “shall be declared invalid” in the new \nversion of Article 52 demonstrated that Mr Beketov was wrong on this point, because \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n245 \n “the court  is the only organ that can declare a transaction invalid”.  In his opinion , this \nwas made clear by Article 215 (3) which  provides  that “where invalidity of a transaction \nis not expressly  established  by law, but the parties thereto or third party challenges its \nvalidity on the grounds prescribed by law, a court may declare such transaction invalid \n(voidable transaction)”.  \n987. I do not accept this part of  Mr Alyoshin ’s analysis .  In my view , his opinion fails to \ngive sufficient we ight to the use of the word “shall”  which removes the new version of \nArticle 52 from the ambit of Article 215(3)  which by using the word “may” is plainly \ndealing with situations in which the court has a discretion to grant a declaration of \ninvalidity .  I also do not consider it is particularly surprising that the legislature \ndetermined that t ransactions between a  bank and its related parties should be void ab \ninitio  unless they are on current market terms.  \n988.

I also do not consider it is particularly surprising that the legislature \ndetermined that t ransactions between a  bank and its related parties should be void ab \ninitio  unless they are on current market terms.  \n988. I therefore prefer  Mr Beketov ’s evidence  that the removal of the reference to the court \nis a significant amendment  and, combined with the use of the word “shall ”, reflected \nan intention by the legislature to change the status of related party transactions on non -\nmarket terms from voidable to void.   In my view  Mr Beketov is correct in his opinion \nthat the effect of the amended version of Article 52 is that a transaction to which it \napplies  is declared invalid by the statute,  a result which is consistent with the legislative \nintent as explained in his supplemental report , which is  to strengthen the liability of \npersons related to a bank for making decisions that affect its financial standing.  \n989. It was also submitted by the Bank that Mr Beketov’s  construction was confirmed by \nthe language of  Article 38 (3) of the DGF Law .  Th is makes  provision for a series of \nreasons for the  invalidity of related party transactions  when the DGF  is taking steps to \nensure the preservation of a bank’s assets.  It opens with the phrase “Transactions, \nincluding those concluded with the persons related to the bank, in which the Fund \ncarries out temporary administration and / or liquidation procedure, are void for the \nfollowing reasons ”.  It then goes on to describe ten circumstances in which related -\nparty transa ctions are treated as void , number (8) of which is:  \n“the bank entered into a transaction with a person related to the bank or in the \ninterests of a person related to the bank, or in favour of a person related to the bank \nin violation of the requirements of the law, including the invalidity of which is \nestablished by Article 52 (6) of the Ukrainian law “On Banks and Banking Activity ” \nhad referred to transactions, the invalidity of which is established by Article 52(6) ”. \n990. This is consistent with Mr Beketov’s opinion , but is not determinative that it is correct.  \nIt is also possible that the  phrase “the invalidity of which is established by Article 52(6)” \nis itself a reference to what occurs when the court grants a declaration of invalidity .  \nNonetheless, I think it gives some support for Mr Beketov’s view which I prefer to Mr \nAlyoshin’s on this point.   I find that with effect from 8 March 2015 , agreements \nbetween a bank and a related party “on terms that are not current mark et terms” will be \nvoid pursuant to Article 52 . \n991. As to the meaning of “terms more favourable than usual ” and “terms that are not current \nmarket terms” , the two different versions of Article 52  both include a list of  the \ncircumstances in which an agreement  will include terms that fall foul of these \nprovisions.  Mr Hunter submitted that the key question when considering these lists is \nwhether the terms are more advantageous to the related party than the terms offered by \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n246 \n the bank to the market generally  or possibly by other banks to the market generally.   \nAlthough the detail of the law changed in March  2015 , I agree with that submission.  \n992. Prior to 8 March 2015 a related party transaction was deemed to be on preferential terms \nand voidable if less security was accepted than that required from other clients  or if the \nproperty acquired was of a low quality or at an inflated price .

It was also voidable if \ninvestment was made in the securities of the related party that would not be made in \nanother enterprise or if payments were made for goods or services at a higher  price  than \nthe ordinary price or in circumstances where such goods or services would not be \nacquired from another party.  \n993. After 8 March 2015  the categories of preferential transaction, now described as “not on \ncurrent market terms” was expanded to include the following additional categories: the \nsale of property to a related party at a price lower than that which the bank would receive \nfrom se lling the property to another, the accrual of interest or commission services \nprovided by the bank to a related party at a lower than ordinary rate and the accrual of \ninterest on deposits received from a related party at a higher than ord inary rate.  \n994. As to the identity of a related party, Mr Beketov explained that the effect of Article 52 \nwas as follows until March 2015 : \n“….if a person ‘A’ held, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of a bank’s shares or \nvoting rights, or was otherwise able to exercise significant influence over that \nbank’s management or activities, then that bank’s related parties would include any \nother compa ny in which A also held, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of that \ncompany’s shares or voting  rights, or was otherwise able to exercise significant \ninfluence over that company’s management or activities. Such companies would \nbe ‘horizontal affiliates ’ of the bank .” \n995. After that date the  first category of related parties are the bank ’s controllers .  Article 2 \nof the Law on Banks  (“Article 2”)  contained the following definition of “controller”, \nwhich was in force at the material times:  \n“an individual or legal entity that is not under the control of individuals and that is \nable to exercise decisive influence on the management or business of a legal entity \nthrough the direct and/or indirect ownership (whether alone or jointly with others) \nof a shareholding in such legal entity that is equivalent to 50 per cent or more of \nthe authorised capital and/or votes in such legal entity or that is able to exercise \nsuch influence contractually or otherwise, regardless of formal ownership”.  \n996. It was Mr Beketov’s unchallenged evidence , which I accept , that the key characteristic \nof a person being a controller is their ability to exercise “decisive influence” on the \nmanagement or business of the entity concerned.   One way in which the law \ncontemplates that decisive influence may be exercised is through the ownership \n(whether alone or jointly with others) of 50% or more of the entity’s authorised capital.  \nAnother way is through the ability of a person to exercise de cisive influence, regardless \nof formal ownership of the bank ’s authorised capital, either through a contractual right \nto do so or as a result of any other circumstances.   It was Mr Beketov’s evidence that \nthe use of the word “otherwise” encompassed, amongst other circumstances, a situation \nin which a person, when acting together with one or more other persons, is able to \nexercise decisive influence over a bank’s management or business.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n247 \n 997.

They also include \nexecutives of the bank and the bank’s committees, the banks horizontal and vertical \naffiliates, and persons with a significant participation in those affiliates and their \nexecutives .  They also extended to associated parties of such people , legal entities in \nwhich any such individuals indicated are executives or in which they hold a significant \nparticipation  and: \n“any person though whom an operation is carried out in the interests of the person \nindicated herein, and upon whom persons indicated herein exercise influence when \nconducting such operations, whether through employment, civil or other relations .” \n998. A further provision relating to avoidance and voidability on which the Bank relied was \nArticle 70  of the JSC Law  (“Article 70”) .  This Article is concerned with significant \ntransactions, being one the value of which exceeds 10% of the value of a company’s \nassets according to its most recent annual financial statements.  It was c ommon ground \nthat a separate resolution of the corporate body concerned must approve any significant \ntransaction , and that body will be the supervisory board.  \n999. Article 70(5)  contains what Mr Beketov called a n anti-circumvention rule , prohibiting \nthe division of a transaction into smaller parts with the aim of circumventing the \nrelevant approval procedure for significant transactions.   Mr Alyoshin  accepted that this \nmeant that , if there is a single transaction in the form of a loan , it is not permitted to \ndivide that single transaction into a smaller number of component parts  in order  to avoid \nthe requirements  for the transaction to be approved by the supervisory b oard.   The \nlanguage of Article 70(5) is : “It is prohibited to divide the subject of the transaction in \norder to evade the procedure for making decisions on conducting a significant \ntransaction ”.  He also accepted that the rules for which Article 70  provided could not \nbe avoided  by splitting what in substance was (e.g.) a loan to a single enterprise into a \nnumber of smaller loans  to a number of different nominees  acting  for the same concern.   \nIn other words, the court will look at the substance of the transaction taken as a whole.  \n1000.  It was also common ground that , until 1 May 2 016, the consequences of non-\ncompliance with  Article 7 0 was that the relevant significant transaction was voidable .  \nIt was also common ground that it is open to a company to  ratify a significant \ntransaction made in breach of these provisions at a later date .  However, there was a \ndisagreement between the experts as to whethe r significant transactions entered into in \nbreach of Article 70 after a change in the law which came into effect on 1 May 2016 \nare merely vo idable or are of no legal effect at all and are therefore void.   Mr Beketov \nsaid that, in the absence of later ratification by the company, they are void.  Mr Alyoshin \nsaid that they are only voidable , as was the case prior to the amendments.   This issue \ntherefore relates only to the New Loans because the Relevant Loans and the \nIntermediary Loans were all concluded before the  date on which the change of law \ncame into effect . \n1001.  The answer to this question depends on the meaning and effect  of the amended Article \n72, the relevant parts of which are as  follows : \n“1. Significant transaction  … concluded in violation of the procedure for making a \ndecision on granting consent to its execution creates, changes, terminates the civil \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower"}

Subsequent approval of the transaction by the company in the manner established \nfor making a decision to grant consent to its conclusion, creates, changes, \nterminates the civil rights and obligations of the joint stock company from the \nmoment this trans action is completed. ” \n1002.  Mr Alyoshin  relied on a resolut ion of the Supreme Court in case No. 911/3039/1 , NPP \nASU LLC  v. Fakel PJSC  (“Fakel ”) in support of his opinion that, where the execution \nof a contract is subject to compliance with corporate procedures (such as obtaining the \nsupervisory board’s approval under Article 70 ), a failure to follow the procedures may \nmake the contract voidabl e, but not void.   He also said that a company seeking to \ninvalidate a contract on this ground must prove that  its agent acted  in breach of the \ncompany’s internal procedures and therefore exceeded his or her powers , and that the \ncounterparty had actual or constructive knowledge of the limitations on those  powers.  \n1003.  Mr Beketov’s response was that Fakel  was not a case which established that the original \ntransaction was only voidable.  The Supreme Court’s decision was that, in the particular \ncircumstances of that case , the supervisory board did not subsequently approve a \ntransaction so as to validate the transaction when it should  have done so.  It analysed \nthe case as one about abuse of rights  (Article 13 , which I have already considered when \nexplaining  what is capable of constituting unlawful conduct for the purposes of Article \n1166) .  It sa id: \n“62. The Supreme Court finds reasonable the appellant's allegations concerning the \nneed to apply the principle of prohibition of contradictory conduct to the disputed \nlegal relations, which is based on the fact that no one can act contrary to their \nprevious  conduct, as well as Art. 13 of the Civil Code on the prohibition of abuse \nof rights.  \n63. The Supervisory Board has the right to approve transactions, but disapproval \nof the transaction by this body must have a reasonable explanation, motives. The \nfailure to approve an executed and partially performed transaction without any \nreason is an abuse of the claimant's right, which was intended to cause harm to the \ncounterparty. The Court considers that the only motive for such a disapproval is a \nrefusal to discharge the obligations arising under the agreement at issue. ” \n1004.  The effect of Mr Beketov’s evidence is that the Supreme Court has held  that the starting \npoint is that  a significant  transaction is void if in breach of Article 72.  Stage two is to \nask whether the transaction has later been ratified by the appropriate corporate body.   If \nit has  not, it will still be void  because it has not been ratified , unless the court is satisfied \nthat the transaction should have been ratified .

I prefer Mr Beketov’s evidence on this point, because it is more consistent with the \nlanguage which the legislature has used.   In my view , Mr Beketov was correct to say \nthat the structure of the wording is that a transaction  in breach of Article 70 only creates, \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n249 \n changes or terminates a company’s civil rights and obligations if there is a further \napproval by the company  which complies with  the applicable rules for granting consent .  \nThis means that , absent any abuse of rights such as that held to have occurred in Fakel , \nthe transaction is of no effect unless that approval is given  by a compliant consent which \ncan be later than the time at which the company purported to conclude  the tran saction.  \nIf no such approval is given any purported creation, change or terminat ion of the \ncompany’s civil rights and obligations is of no effect , and is therefore void.  \n \nWere the Relevant Loans, RSAs , Intermediary Loans and New Loans void?  \n1006.  The Banks submitted that all of the Relevant Loans, the RSAs, the Intermediary Loans \nand the New Loans were transactions contrary to public policy pursuant to Article \n228(2), in that they were concluded for the purpose and with the aim of \n“misappropriating any property of a company”  as that phrase is used in Article \n228(1) (ii).  In assessing that case, the court is required by Article 235 to focus on the \ntrue nature of the transaction , if the words of the relevant agreement do not reflect the \nparties’ true intent .  I am satisfied that they do not.  The  Relevant Loans were not loans \nat all; they were simply a paper exercise purporting to  record what was in fact the \ntransfer of money by t he Bank to the Borrowers pursuant to the Relevant Drawdowns \nfor a worthless consideration and without any genuine security .  As Mr Hunter put it in \nclosing submissions, t he promise to repay was illusory . \n1007.  He made the same submission in relation to the Intermediary Loans and the New Loans .  \nThe Intermediary Loans  and the New Loans represented further illegitimate sham \nlending, which was part of the process of covering up the original Misappropriation that \nhad occurred at the time of the Relevant Drawdowns .  It follows that for the same \nreasons as those advanced in relation to the Relevant Loans , the loan agreements for \nthe Intermediary Loans and the New Loans were simply sha ms recording what was in \nfact the t ransfer of money by the Bank to the Intermediary Borrowers and the New \nBorrowers for a worthless consideration and without any genuine security . \n1008.  It was submitted that the same conclusion can be reached in relation to the RSAs. The \nway it was put in Mr Hunter's oral closing submissions was that  they were shams, \nbecause the true transaction was simply the payment of US$ for no consideration from \none shell company in Ukraine (one of the Borrowers) to another shell company out of \nUkraine (one of the Corporate Defendants ) in order to launder money and cover up the \nMisappropriation .  It was never intended by either the Borrowers or the Corporate \nDefendant s that their terms would be complied with  – they were not real supply \nagreements at all .  He submitted that it is clear that this was the true nature of the \ntransactions once unmasked, which is what Article 235 requires to be done . \n1009.

Having identified the true nature of the transaction, the next step in the analysis was for \nthe Bank to establish that the aim of the Relevant Loans  and RSAs , as revealed , was \nthe misappropriati on of the B ank’s property .  It was submitted by Mr Kolomoisky’s \ncounsel in their written closing submissions t hat it was not , broadly  for two reasons .  \nThe first reason was that the focus of the inquiry must be on the Bank’s intention, not \nonly on that of the Borrowers.  It was said that if a bank intends a loan to be repaid, it \nwould be surprising if it could be held void simply on the basis that the Borrower did \nnot intend  to return the money .  It was said that t he Ukrainian cases applying Article \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n250 \n 228 involve collusive agreements to defraud a third party (frequently a tax authority), \nnot agreements which one party simply intends not to perform . \n1010.  In the light of the conclusions I reached as to Tigerfish  and Prezenta Premium  (see \nparagraph 975 above) , I think that the argument that  if only one party to the transaction \nlacks the requisite intention then the transaction cannot be void under Article 228, is \nnot well -founded  as a matter of Ukrainian law.   It is also difficult to square with the \nagreed position of the Ukrainian law experts that “it is also necessary for one or more  \nof the parties to have known (actually or constructively) that the transaction was \ncontrary to public policy and to have intended or willingly accepted those harmful \neffects ” [emphasis added].  The words I have emphasised do at least imply that the  \nintention and willing acceptance of one only of the parties is sufficient to satisfy the \ntest. \n1011.  But, even if that were not to be the case, the Bank contended that , in the context of the \npresent case , the argument  fails on the facts . This leads into Mr Kolomoisky’s second \nreason for contending that the aim of the Relevant Loans  and RSAs  as revealed was not \nthe misappropriation of the Bank’s property.  In some respects this is one of the central  \naspects of th is par t of the  case, because it illuminates the nature of the underlying \nscheme.  For this purpose, the parties on which the court must concentrate are the Bank \non the one hand and the Borrowers , Intermediary Borrowers and New Borrowers on \nthe other.   They were all controlled by the Individual Defendan ts and it was said by the \nBank  that the evidence shows that  everyone involved  both intended and knew that the \npurpose of the Relevant Loans and the RSAs was to extract money from the Bank and \ntransfer it  outside Ukraine to other  entiti es conducting other aspects of the Individual \nDefendants ’ businesses , leaving the Bank with a worthless claim for recovery against \nshell companie s. \n1012.  The position was said to be similar in relation to  the Intermediary Loans , where the \npurpose was to keep the wheels of the fraud turning , while in the case o f the New Loans, \nthey were entered into with the apparent aims of deferring the repayment of the existing \nloans by 8  to 10 years and releasing the existing security (inadequate though it was) \nover shares in their companies.  Like the Borrowers , the Intermediary Borrowers and \nthe New Borrowers , who received the monies drawn down , were entities owned and \ncontrolled by the Individual Defendants  and parti cipated in the loan recycling scheme \n(in the case of the Intermediary Borr owers) and the Transformation (in the case of the \nNew Borrowers) as part of the process of and with the aim of mi"}

The Defendants  submitted that this was not established on the evidence.  It was said  by \nMr Kolo moisky , relying on Ms Montgomery’ s cross -examination of Ms Pakhachuk , \nthat the Relevant Loans were part of a loan recycling scheme , which appeared to have \nstarted in 2009  and had been in place for many years.   It was then submitted that the \ncontemporaneous evidence demonstrated that the purpose of advancing Relevant \nDrawdowns was to enable funds to move from the Bank and to repay existing loans, \nvia the process of  prepayments and returns of prepayments  I described in the section of \nthis judgment which deals with Relevant Drawdowns . \n1014.  The way that Mr Kolomoisky described what was happening was that the Bank issued \nwhat he referred to a s “technical loans”  (of which he accepted that the Relevant Loans \nformed part ) to what he called service companies (including e.g., the Borrowers) in \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n251 \n order effectively to extend loans and circumvent foreign currency controls imposed by \nthe NBU.   The critical point , which was then made , was that a ny suggestion that it can \nsimply be inferred that there was a preconceived plan not to return the Unreturned \nPrepayments is inconsistent with the  evidence as to why th ey could not be returned.   It \nwas submitted  that the reason for this was  the NBU’s resolution 540 dated 29 August \n2014 (see paragraph 401 above), as a consequence of which those operating the loan \nrecycling scheme within the Bank realised that it would not be possible to allow \nborrowers to draw down money to make prepayments to Suppliers because they  would \ncome under increased scrutiny from the NBU and would be prohibited  from doing so . \n1015.  It was submitted  that this  then led to letters from the Corporate Defendants  to each of \nthe Borrowers explaining that they were unable to supply the goods and promising to \nrepay the Unreturned Prepayments.  When the Unreturned Prepayments  were  not \nreturned, the Borrowers issued claims against the Corporate  Defendants in the form of \nthe 201 4 Ukrainian Proceedings .  It was then s ubmitted  that the NBU’s intervention \nprevented any further advances being made as prepayments under Supply Agreements , \nand that it was apparent from communications at the time that this turn of event s had \nnot been anticipated.  \n1016.  The consequence was said to be  that this way of advancing funds to Suppliers to enable \nthem to make  returns of prepayment s could no longer be used  and that this  explain ed \nthe occurrence of Unreturned Prepayments .  It followed that the court  should not \nconclude that there was any pre-ordained  scheme to siphon the money  in the form of \nthe Relevant Drawdowns  that had been used to fund the Unreturned Prepayment s away \nfrom the Bank at any earlier stage (viz. three months , or in some cases longer , ago). \n1017.  The Bank’s answer to this submission is relevant  both to this issue and  to quantification \nof the compensation to which it claim s to be entitled for the harm it says was caused to \nit by the Defendants’ unlawful acts.

The Bank’s answer to this submission is relevant  both to this issue and  to quantification \nof the compensation to which it claim s to be entitled for the harm it says was caused to \nit by the Defendants’ unlawful acts.  It was said that t he fact that the Borrowers may \nhave taken  the Bank’s money with the intention to use it to pay off some other liability  \nfrom a previous round of loan recycling , designed to avoid foreign currency controls \nimposed by the NBU , does not exonerate those responsible (including the Defendants) \nfor authorising, consent ing to and participating in the transaction s.  It will still be  a \nmisappropriation of the Bank’s  property if is taken for no valid considerat ion because \nthe covenant to repay pursuant to which it was take n is of n o value  and it was still the \naim of those involved that this should occur . \n1018.  I agree with this submission .  I accept  that the transactions which took place pursuant \nto the Relevant Loans were all aimed at taking the Bank’s property and then laundering \nthe money through the RSA s.  They did not constitute genuine o r proper lending an d \nthe covenants to repay were always known to be worthless.   As I have already \nexplained , the Borrowers lacked substance, they were all owned and controlled by the \nIndividual Defendants (as were the Corporate Defendants) , all but the loans to the \nCypriot Borrowers and Prominmet originated from within BOK, there was no genuine \napproval process  and the  security was either worthless or illusor y. \n1019.  Similarly, the RSAs  were not genuine contracts and  neither the relevant Borrower nor \nthe relevant Corporate Defendant  ever had any intention that they would deliver the \nspecified goods, nor could they ever have done so given the vast and unrealistic \nquantities of commodities they purportedly agreed to provide.   In my judgment, the  \nRSAs, like the Relevant Loans, Intermediary Loans and New Loans , amounted to \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n252 \n transactions aimed at misappropriation of the Bank’s property within the meaning of \nArticle 228 (1) and, as a matter of Ukrainian law, are therefore void . \n1020.  The Bank also submitted that those of  the Intermediary Loans which were granted after \n8 March 20 15 and all of the New Loans were void as contrary to Art icle 52, because \nthey were transactions with related parties on non -market terms .  This was said to be \nthe case because the terms in the relevant agreements were more advantageous to the \nIntermediary and New Borrowers than those offered by the Bank to unrelated parties \nand/or the terms offered by other banks to equivalent customers.   The basis for this \nsubmission was that the relevant Intermediary Borrowers and the New Borrowers were \nall shell entities with no assets and no incomes , but the Bank was still prepa red to grant \nthem billions of US$ in loans without any valid security at rates of interest which were  \nsubstantially below those prevailing in Ukraine in 2015 -16.  The interest payable to the \nBank under the New Loans was a fixed r ate of 10.5% per annum, which was \nsubstantially below prevailing market rates.  \n1021.  In my judgment the Bank has established this way of putting  its case as well .  The \nIndividual Defendant were together controllers of the Bank, within the definition  I have  \nexplained in paragraphs 994ff above .  When they acted together they held in excess of \n90% of the Bank’s equity and both separately and together they were a ble to exercise a \ndecisive influence on the Bank’s management  and business .  They were also person s \nwith a significant participation in the Bank and were both member s of the Supervisory \nBoard.

It also meant that the control they exercised over and the relationship \nthey had with the Borrowers , the Intermediary Borrowers and the New Borrowers  \nconfirmed  that, through horizontal affiliation , those entities  were rel ated parties to the \nBank as well . \n1022.  It follows that the post -March 2015 Intermediary Loans an d the New Loans were void  \nas well , because they were plainly “not on current market terms” within the meaning of \nArticle 52 .  They were on terms more advantageous to the relevant I ntermediary \nBorrower s and the New Borrower s than the terms offered by the Bank to the market \ngenerally  because  the Bank was still prepared to grant them very large  loans without \nany valid security at rates of  interest which were  substantially below those prevailing \nin Ukraine in 2015 -16. \n1023.  The final issue relating to those of the Bank’s loans said to be void arose out of Article \n70.  This issue applies only to the New Loans which were granted as part of the \nTransformation .  It is said by the Bank that they were part of a coordinated scheme for \nreplacing the existing indebtedness of Borrowers with new loans to the New Borrowers , \nwhich were also companies  owned and controlled by the Individual Defendants.  In \nOctober and November 2016, the Bank issued New Loans with a total face value of \nUAH 12 6.9 billion, at a time when its latest financial statements , for the year ending 31 \nDecember 2015 , showed total assets of UAH 274  billion.  The New Loans, assessed in \naggregate , therefore exceeded 10% of the value of the Bank’s assets, and if aggregation \nis required for these purposes would therefore be “significant  transactions” subject to \nthe authorisation regime set out in Art icle 70.  Aggregation is required if the  anti-\ncircumvention provision in Art icle 70(5) is engaged , which it will be  if there is a single \ntransaction which is divided  into a smaller number of component parts in order to avoid \nthe requirements for the transaction to be approved by the Supervisory Board.  It will \nalso be engaged if the making of the New Loans also involved the splitting of what in \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n253 \n substance was a loan to a single enterprise into a number of smaller loans to a number \nof different nominees acting for the same concern , or if what occurred can be \ncharacterised as a single transaction  because the individual loans were , in reality, part \nof a single scheme . \n1024.  I am satisfied that , if the anti -circumvention provision  applies , the New Loans  were not \nthe subject of formal approval by the shareholders or the Supervisory Board as required \nby Article 70 , and the New Borrowers (as entit ies owned and controlled by  the \nIndividual Defendants ) will have known that that was the case . On that hypothesis, t he \nNew Loans would therefore be void pursuant to Article 72(1) .  The issue which remains \nis whether Ukrainian law would indeed treat the New Loans  on an aggregated basis by \nreason of Article 70(5) , because the  Bank does  not suggest  that any of the individual \nNew Loans exceeded 10% of the value of the Bank’s assets so as engag e the avoidance . \n1025.  This point was not addressed in the Individual Defendants’  closing submissions and Mr \nKolomoisky submitted that  it did not arise .

This point was not addressed in the Individual Defendants’  closing submissions and Mr \nKolomoisky submitted that  it did not arise .  But in any event, I do not think that the \nBank has proved its case on th is particular  point.  Although there is no doubt that the \nTransformation and the issue of the New Loans w ere part of the same process for \nreplacing with the New Borrowers, the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers the n \nrecorded as debtors in the Bank’s books , the test  which must be applied is whether what \nwould otherwise have been a single transaction  was divided in order to evade the \nprocedure for making decisions on conducting a significant transaction  (i.e., the \napproval processes required by the Charter or otherwise in accordance with Article \n70(1)).  The Bank did not identify any evidence to justi fy a conclusion that this was the \nreason that the New Loans were divided in the way they were . \n1026.  Indeed the evidence points to the contrary .  It is the Bank’s case, which I have already \naccept ed, that the T ransformation plan was never agreed with the  NBU and that the \nway in which the whole exercise was carried out amounted to an attempt to present the \nNBU with  a fait accompli  (see paragraph 556 above) .  In my view this supports a \nconclusion that the  issue  of the New Loans in the way that they were divided was more \nlikely to have been driven by  the Individual Defendants’ intention to pres ent the NBU \nwith something which they might have  been persuaded  to accept,  artificial and deficient \nthough it was,  than it was by any desire to avoid having to comply with Article 70 . \n \nThe Repayment Defence : Outline  \n1027.  Mr Kolomoisky made the running on the  Repayment Defence.  In essence it was a \ndefence that any harm caused by the Defendants ’ unlawful conduct was no longer harm \nfor which the Bank was entitle d to compensation under Article 1166, because the loan \nor drawdown which caused the original loss was repaid.  The way in which it was \npleaded on his behalf was that , save for a loan to Tamersa in the amount of US$19.2 \nmillion  and a  loan to Prominmet  in the amount of US$ 55.7 million , the Ukrainian \nBorrowers’ obliga tions under all of the Relevant Loans were discharged by three \ndifferent categories of repayment .  His case was pleaded as one of automatic extinction \nof the Bank’s loss by reason of the repayment of the Relevant Loans, whether or not \nthey were void.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n254 \n 1028.  The first way in which  this was said to have been  done was that , during the period when \nRelevant Drawdowns were being made , and thereafter until February 2016, Cash \nRepayments totalling UAH 10.9 billion (UAH 7.125 billion before 10 September 2014 \nand UAH 3. 755 billion thereafter) and US$1.2 billion (US$1.15 billion before 10 \nSeptember 2014 and US $45 million thereafter) were made.   I have already made this \npoint but, a lthough called Cash Repayments , these amounts  were in fact the proceeds \nof loans derived fr om other Relevant Loans and Intermediary Loans transferred by way \nof accounting entry in the Bank’s books.   Mr Kolomoisky then contende d that , once \nthose Cash Repayment s had been taken into account, t he outstanding balance on \nRelevant Loans was UAH 4.39 billion and US$976 million.  \n1029.  The second category of repayment for which Mr Kolomoisky  then contended was that \nUAH 1.296 billion and US$5 38 million outstanding under the Relevant Loans was \nrepaid between March and September 2016 by way of the Asset Transfer s.  This was \nachieved by the transfer of assets by third -party transfer ors under mortgage agreements, \nafter which the Bank applied the value of the Transferred Assets (which were subject \nto n"}
{"start": 952000, "text": "ce on \nRelevant Loans was UAH 4.39 billion and US$976 million.  \n1029.  The second category of repayment for which Mr Kolomoisky  then contended was that \nUAH 1.296 billion and US$5 38 million outstanding under the Relevant Loans was \nrepaid between March and September 2016 by way of the Asset Transfer s.  This was \nachieved by the transfer of assets by third -party transfer ors under mortgage agreements, \nafter which the Bank applied the value of the Transferred Assets (which were subject \nto negotiation with the NBU) in reduction of  the outstanding balance on loans including \nRelevant Loans and Intermediary Loans.  He also contended that the amounts \noutstanding under Intermediary Loans which were not also Relevant Loans was reduced \nby UAH 1.2 76 billion and US$123 million as part of the same process . \n1030.  After completion of the Asset Transfer s, the remaining outstanding balances on the \nRelevant Loans totall ed UAH 3,075.4 million and US$4 05.6 million.   These amounts \nwere then said to have been discharged by the third category of Cash R epayment:  the \nproceeds of New Loans to New Borrowers advanced between October and November \n2016 as part of the Transformation.  \n1031.  So far as the Relevant Loan to Tamersa is concerned, it is said that, since \nnationalisation, the Bank has treated it as valid and in full force and effect.  It did so by \nobtaining judgment on 8 January 2019 from the Commercial Court for the \nDnipropetrovsk Region enforcing its right to accelerate the date for repayment and \ndeclaring that the sum of US$24,063,107.03 (UAH 627,353,209.73) including accrued \ninterest and penalties for late payment was then due.   As to the Cyprio t Borrowers, Mr \nKolomoisky pleaded that the Relevant Loans (which in those instances gave rise to \nRelevant Drawdowns totalling US$118 million) were repaid on 5 March 2014 which \nwas only two days after the drawdowns had been made.  \n1032.  The consequence of these categories of repayment was said by Mr Kolomoisky to be \nthat, save for an admitted shortfall of between US$19 million  and US $25 million (the \ndifference is immaterial for present purposes) , all of the Relevant Loans , including the \namounts advanced pursuant to the Relevant Drawdowns , were  repaid in full .  Mr \nKolomoisky then pleaded that the Bank cannot ignore repayments funded by \nIntermediary Loans or New Loans and that any loss caused by the Relevant Drawdowns \nwas extinguished to the  extent that it was repaid.  It was also said that the Bank was no t \nentitled to ignore th e credits granted to Borrowers in return for the Asset Transfer s, \nhaving taken no steps to set aside the transa ction by which they were given effect .  \nThere was therefore no compensation payable under Article 1166.   \n1033.  This continued to be the Defendants’ case in circumstances in which the Relevant Loans \nwere held to be valid .  However, i n his closing submissions, it was alleged by Mr \nKolomoisky for the first time that  the position was different if the Relevant Loans were \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n255 \n void.  It was said that the  effect of the expert evidence (including most particular ly that \nfrom Mr Beketov ) was that the  Bank has suffered no loss in respect of the Relevant \nLoans , if and to the extent that it  chose  to accept payments as discharging the relevant \nBorrowers ’ liabilities to return the sums drawn down under the Relevant Loans , which \non the basis that the Relevant Loan was void would be a liability in restitution , as \nopposed to other liabilities in respect of later loans.  In making this argument, Mr \nKolomoisky  relied not on the fact that the Bank initially credited the Borrowers with \nrepayment while it was owned and c ontrolled by the Individual Defendants, but on what \nwas said to have been  a decision made by  the Bank’s new management when they \nsigned off the Bank’s f inancial statements for 2016 on 25 "}

The Bank contended that this case was unplea ded and cannot be substantiated , either as \na matter of fact or as a matter of Ukrainian law .  It depends on establishing  that decisions \nand acts made and committed by the Bank were choices which have relevant legal \nconsequences , which the Bank argued they did not .  I shall come back to the detail of \nthe way the Defendants’ case is now put and to the Bank’s answer to it.  Before doing \nso, I think it is necessary to explain the way the Repayment Defence  was originally \npleaded and argued, and the Bank’s answer to it, because it helps to put the Defendants’ \ncurrent case in its proper context.   \n \nThe original Repayment Defence  and the Bank’s answer to it  \n1035.  The starting point was that the unlawful conduct in which the Defendants are said to \nhave participated, was the agreements to make the Relevant Loans together with the \nconsequence of permitting and authorising the Relevant Drawdowns to be made.  I have \nalready made findings on these points, but it is worth reiterating that the Bank’s case in \nits pleading and its opening, which I have concluded is correct, was that it then sustained \nimmediate economic harm when each of the Relevant Drawdowns was made.  As it  \nexplained, the concept of harm “encompasses the transfer of a claimant’s funds to third \nparties”, i.e., in this case the Borrowers.  \n1036.  The reason the Bank suffered harm at the time that each Relevant Drawdown was made, \nrather than at any later date, was that this was the time that it was deprived of its \nproperty.  It did not matter that the deprivation was accompanied by the execution of \nan agreement for a Relevant Loan, because each of those further loan agreements was \na sham, intended to misappropriate funds from the Bank and therefore was void under \nUkrainian law.  It followed that the Bank did not receive the benefit of a genuine \npromi se in return for the transfer of its funds and, even if it had, the promise would have \nbeen worthless because it was given by a shell company as part of a fraudulent scheme.  \nThe Bank’s submission in opening, which continued to be its case throughout, was that \n“that harm was not reduced by the Borrowers’ purported promises to repay the Relevant \nLoans … because those promises were legally void and/or factually worthless.”  \n1037.  Against that background, the essence of the Bank’s answer to the Repayment Defence \nas originally pleaded in the various versions of the Defendants’ Defences was that no \ngenuine repayment of principal or interest was made in relation to any of the Relevant \nLoans, including those made to the Cypriot Borrowers (para 18(c)(iii) and 18A(b) of \nits Re -Re-Re-Re-Amended Particulars of Claim).

I shall come back to this in a little more detail, but it follows that I do not accept the \nsubmission which underpinned much of what Mr Howard had to say in his closing \nsubmissions on the Repayment Defence, that what has never been in dispute is the \nquesti on of whether the Borrowers ’ obligations to repay the Relevant Drawdowns have \nin fact been discharged.  It is not in issue that the Bank recorded in its books that the \nRelevant Loans had been repaid, and it is also clear that the Bank challenged the \nquesti on of whether or not the Relevant Loans had been repaid (it was careful to use \nthe concept of “purported” repayment throughout) in the context of what it treated as \nthe separate question of the loss it sustained as a result of the Defendants ’ tortious \nconduct.  Nonetheless, it is plain to me that the Bank has never accepted that the impact \nof payment being made from monies drawn down under further loans is properly to be \ncharacterised as repayments extinguishing the Borrowers ’ liabilities to the Bank.  \n1039.  After a number of amendments, the final version of the Bank’s pleaded case was that \n“there has been no repayment of any of the funds transferred out of the Bank’s control \npursuant to the Misappropriation”, which was then particularised by reference to what  \nthe Bank called the “purported” repayments relied on by Mr Kolomoisky as follows:  \n“Such purported loans and repayments were made for the purposes of disguising \nthe Misappropriation. They do not amount to legitimate lending or the repayment \nof capital and stand to be ignored. To the extent necessary, the Bank will contend \nthat such furth er purported loans are (i) shams and/or (ii) transactions that are \ncontrary to Ukrainian public policy and/or (iii) (insofar as Intermediary Loans were \npurportedly entered into on or after 8 March 2015) they constitute void related -\nparty lending on non -market terms (contrary to Article 52) 16 and/or (iv) (insofar \nas Intermediary Loans were purportedly entered into on or after 1 May 2016) they \ntogether constitute an unauthorised (and therefore ineffective) significant \ntransaction contrary to Article 70 of th e JSC Law.”  \n1040.  The way that the Bank pleaded its case in the various iterations of its Particulars of \nClaim was then confirmed in its Reply.  It expressly denied that the Relevant Loans \nwere the subject of genuine repayment.  It then pleaded that the “so called” Cash \nRepayments were made using funds derived from Intermediary Loans, being defined \nas “purported” repayments of the capital advanced under the Relevant Loans, made for \nthe purposes of disguising the Misappropriation.  It also pleaded that “the purported \nrepaymen ts fall to be disregarded and, in any event, did not in fact reduce the Bank’s \nloss”.   In my judgment the form of words used to plead the Bank’s case in its Reply \nmade quite clear that the so called repayments could not properly be characterised as \nsuch a nd did not in any event reduce the Bank’s loss.  The two points are separately \npleaded and the Bank’s case to that effect is clearly articulated.  \n1041.  In dealing with the Repayment Defence in opening, the Bank’s position was consistent \nwith its pleading.  It said that the “so -called ‘cash repayments’ were all sourced from \nfurther fraudulent lending”, and then went on to say that its position was that purported  \n‘cash repayments’ do not constitute a genuine recovery for the Bank so as to reduce the \nBank’s loss.  The Bank’s case as to the Repayment Defence continued to be clear.

The Bank then continued its analysis by submitting that it would be remarkable if, in a \nsituation in which the Intermediary Drawdowns, the Intermediary Loans and the New \nLoans were found to be fraudulent, they could nevertheless amount to a recovery by the  \nBank which extinguished liability in respect of the Misappropriation.  This submission \nwas focused on liability in respect of the loss sustained as a result of the tortious act, \nbut it was clear that the Bank was also submitting that it took issue with th e way in \nwhich the Defendants characterised the recovery which the Bank was said by them to \nhave made.  It is clear that it continued to challenge their characterisation as genuine \nrepayments of a genuine loan, and it concluded this part of its written ope ning by \nsummarising its position as follows:  \n“For these reasons, as a matter of first principle and Ukrainian law, the Repayment \nDefence (insofar as it relies on Intermediary and New Loans) is wrong in principle: \nthere were no genuine repayments and, in any event, purported repayments using \nfurther f raudulently obtained sham loans do not reduce the Bank’s loss.”  \n1043.  Mr Kolomoisky’s pleaded case was that this was wrong.  His argument started from the \npropositions that the Relevant Drawdowns involved actual transfers of money by the \nBank, and that the liabilities under the Relevant Loans pursuant to which those Relevant \nDrawdowns were made were extinguished by actual transfers of money back to the \nBank, whatever the source f rom which those transfers were funded.  He said that this \nwas the case irrespective of whether the Relevant Loans were valid or void, because, in \nthe event they were valid, any contractual obligation was discharged by repayment and, \nin the event they were void, any restitutionary obligation was discharged when the Bank \nchose to treat the Borrowers as having repaid all they owed.  \n1044.  It was a central part of Mr Kolomoisky’s argument that the origin of the funds used to \ndischarge the original liability in respect of the Relevant Loans was irrelevant.  If and \nto the extent that the Intermediary Loans or the New Loans were unlawfully obta ined, \nthe Bank might have a separate claim in respect of that wrongdoing, but that fact did \nnot affect the discharge of the Borrowers’ original liabilities.  It was said in his closing \nsubmissions that this appeared to be common ground.  \n1045.  The analysis was that the return to the Bank of the funds advanced under the Relevant \nDrawdowns meant that the Borrowers no longer had any liabilities in respect of them, \nbecause their obligation to repay had been fully performed.  It was said that, in tho se \ncircumstances, the tortious loss arising from the Relevant Loans (as opposed to any \nseparate wrongdoing) was extinguished.  It was said that it was fallacious for the Bank \nto contend that its loss had not been extinguished.  When it made that argument, it can \nonly have been referring to its overall or net loss arising from a series of torts rather \nthan the loss it sustained as a result of the Relevant Drawdowns.  In short the only loss \nthat it claimed had been extinguished by repayment, even if the circu mstances of the \nrepayment were themselves tortious and caused the Bank a further loss which is not the \nsubject of the claim.   \n1046.

This argument reflects the way in which Mr Kolomoisky’s case had always been \nadvanced, and in particular that the Relevant Loans were themselves actually repaid by \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n258 \n the Cash Repayments, the Asset Transfers and the Transformation.  As his current \npleading makes plain, the consequence is said to be that, for that reason, it can now be \nseen that the making of the Relevant Drawdowns caused the Bank no loss.  Mr \nBogolyubov  also adopted this position, pleading that the Relevant Loans were actually \nrepaid and were recognised by the Bank as having been repaid in its transactional data \nand financial statements and denies that in those (amongst other) circumstances the \nalleged M isappropriation caused any loss to the Bank.  \n1047.  Mr Howard also submitted in closing that the Bank’s pleading only operated at what he \ndescribed as a second level, by which he meant that the Bank was simply alleging that \nthe repayment of the capital advanced under the Relevant Loans stood to be ignored f or \nthe purposes of the Bank’s allegation that it had suffered loss as a result of the unlawful \nacts constitut ing the Misappropriation.  He said that it did not extend to an allegation \nthat, as between the Bank and the Borrowers, repayments were made which discharged \ntheir liabilities to the Bank.  I do not agree.  A proper reading of paragraphs 18(c)(iii), \n18A(b) and 62 of the Bank’s pleading does not limit it in that way.  The Bank was \ncareful to plead that what occurred was not a genuine repayment without  limiting the \ncontext in which the plea was made.  \n1048.  Nor do I think that Mr Howard gets the assistance on this point that he sought from the \nList of Issues.  There is agreement between the parties that the Bank’s transactional \ndata recorded repayment of the Relevant Loans in a particular form, i.e., by the C ash \nRepayments, the Asset Transfers and the Transformation.  But the phrase “Cash \nRepayments” was defined by reference only to what was recorded (Issue 32) rather than \nby reference to their agreed nature, and is explicitly said in Issue 37 to be a phrase wh ich \ndescribes (on the Bank’s case) only purported  repayments.  Indeed, throughout the \nrelevant section of the List of Issues, the references to repayments are all references to \nwhat was recorded in the Bank’s transactional data, and it is clear that the Bank’s case \nwas that their characterisation as such  was not accepted.  \n1049.  Mr Howard also submitted that, because Issue 36 asked whether “the (on the Bank’s \ncase, purported) repayments stand to be ignored in assessing the Bank’s loss?” that \nshows that the Bank somehow accepts that the repayments had in fact been made but \nstood to  be ignored for loss purposes and those purposes alone.  Mr Howard said that \nthe wording of Issue 39.3 also supported this reading, because it provided for something \n(i.e., repayment), which everyone accepted had happened, to be ignored:  \n“Were the Intermediary Loans shams and/or transactions contrary to Ukrainian \npublic policy and/or void related party lending contrary to Article 52 of the Law on \nBanks? If so, do the repayments of Relevant Drawdowns by Intermediary \nDrawdowns stand to be ig nored?”  \n1050.  I do not agree with this submission.

I think it is clear from a fair reading of the List of \nIssues that the Bank only ever accepted that the repayments that were recorded in its \nbooks were “purported” repayments and were not properly to be characterised a s such.  \nOn a proper reading of the Bank’s case, the treatment of the Cash Repayments as \nrepayments was to be ignored, not because the starting point was that, although they \nwere repayments they should be ignored for a particular purpose (i.e., loss in the  context \nof the tort claim against the Defendants), but because they were not properly to be \ntreated as repayments at all.  In short, the List of Issues does not provide that they are \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n259 \n to be ignored only for the limited purpose of assessing the Bank’s claim to have suffered \nloss in consequence of the Defendants’ tortious conduct.  \n1051.  The Corporate Defendants approached the Repayment Defence from a slightly different \nperspective.  They said that, if and in so far as the Individual Defendants succeed in \nshowing that all or any part of the Relevant Loans were repaid (and therefore that th e \nBank has suffered no loss), the Bank cannot succeed in its claim in unjust enrichment \nagainst them without proving that the source of any Unreturned Prepayment received \nby any one of the Corporate Defendants was not a Relevant Drawdown made under a \nRelev ant Loan that was in fact repaid.  \n1052.  The evidential basis for the Bank’s argument that, notwithstanding what was recorded \nin its own books and records, there were no genuine repayments and, in any event, that \npurported repayments using further fraudulently obtained sham loans did not reduce t he \nBank’s loss, can be traced back to the statement given by Mr Beketov for the purposes \nof the Defendants’ jurisdiction challenges in 2019: JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank  \nv. Kolomoisky and others  [2019] EWCA Civ 1708, [2020] Ch 783.  In its judgment at \n[230], the Court of Appeal explained the point as follows:  \n“An important strand in the Bank’s contentions on this point is the proposition that, \nas a matter of Ukrainian law, a purported repayment of a Relevant Loan can be \ndisregarded if the repayment was made with funds derived from another fraudulent \nloan. In th is respect, the Bank relies on evidence from Mr Beketov, who expressed \nthe opinion in his report of 6 July 2018 that, “where monies purportedly used to \nrepay an unlawful loan are themselves referable to other, unlawful lending, as a \nmatter of Ukrainian law  the repayment would not be considered to operate to \nreduce the Bank’s loss ([15]).”  \n1053.  This evidence was reiterated for the purposes of the trial in [137] of Mr Beketov’s main \nreport.  He explained that, where monies purportedly used to repay an unlawful loan, \nwhich he called “loan 1” (in this case the Relevant Loans) are themselves referrab le to \nother unlawful lending, which he called “loan 2” (in this case the Intermediary Loans \nor the New Loans), the purported repayment of loan 1 would not operate to reduce the \nlender’s loss caused by loan 1 for which the lender would remain entitled to be  fully \ncompensated.  \n1054.  In expressing this opinion, Mr Beketov relied on his earlier evidence that, if loan 2 was \nunlawful and for that reason void, it would be void ab initio  and would have no legal \nconsequences save for those associated with its invalidity (such as restitution or \ndamages pursuant to Article 216).  In his view, it followed that a Ukrainian court would \nnot uphold its purported effect in discharging the liabilit y"}

In his view, it followed that a Ukrainian court would \nnot uphold its purported effect in discharging the liabilit y in tort arising from the making \nof loan 1.  He further said as follows:  \n“Putting the point another way, in my view where a tortfeasor causes harm to a \nvictim, the tortfeasor cannot be allowed to eliminate that harm by stealing money \nfrom the victim at a later date then returning it to the victim in purported \ncompensation for t he earlier tort. Whilst, perhaps unsurprisingly, I have not found \nany caselaw on this point, I am confident that a Ukrainian court would reject any \nsuch suggestion. It would create a perverse incentive for the tortfeasor (who could, \nfor example, eliminate liability for a discovered tort by committing a further tort \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n260 \n that might not be discovered) and in my view would be contrary to principles of \njustice, reasonableness and fairness (Article 3(6) of the Civil Code).”  \n1055.  It was also Mr Beketov’s evidence that the loss from each of loan 1 and loan 2 would \nbe (for each tort) the amount of that loan less any genuine compensation received in \nrelation to that tortious loss, from which he explicitly excluded purported loan \nrepay ments referable to other unlawful loans.  He said that there was no rule of \nUkrainian law that would oblige the victim to sue the wrongdoer in relation to one \ninstance of misappropriation rather than the other, and the victim could choose which \ninstance of  misappropriation to sue upon (but would not be entitled to make double \nrecovery).  \n1056.  In his supplemental trial report, Mr Beketov confirmed that he would reach the same \nconclusion in a situation in which the court determines that the Relevant Loans were \nnot void, but nevertheless found that they were the product of the Defendants’ unlawful  \nand tortious conduct causing harm to the Bank. He said that, in this scenario, there \nwould be an earlier misappropriation and a later misappropriation, both of which \ninvolved unlawful and tortious conduct and both of which caused loss in the amount of \nthe funds misappropriated less any genuine recovery by the victim.  The victim could \nthen sue in respect of either misappropriation, but would not be permitted to recover in \nrespect of both.  \n1057.  He accepted that in the case of repayments, the payment itself was not void, but said \nthat the transaction pursuant to which the payment was made was void and that a \nUkrainian court would not permit a void transaction, in the form of loan 2 to have the \nlegal consequence of reducing a person’s liability to pay compensation for a prior tort.  \nHe reached this conclusion, having first said that he was doing so on the basis that the \npurported repayment of the Relevant Loans using funds from the Intermediary Loan s \nand the New Loans did not discharge any contractual repayment obligations because, \nif the original Relevant Loans were void as alleged by the Bank, then they created no \ncontractual obligations which could be discharged.  \n1058.  The difference between Mr Beketov and Mr Alyoshin on this central point was \nsummarised in paragraph 46 of the experts’ joint statement as follows:  \n“46.1  OB’s view is that, on an application of first principles, where monies \npurportedly used to repay an unlawful loan are themselves referable to other, \nunlawful loans, then the purported repayment of the earlier loan would not operate \nto reduce the Ban k's tortious loss caused by that loan.

In OB’s further view, the victim in such a scenario can choose which \nunlawful loan (i.e., which tort) to sue upon, with the loss caused by each tort being \nequal to the amount of the unlawful loan less any genuine compensation received \nin relation to that t ortious loss; however, the victim would not be permitted to \ndouble recover.  \n“46.2  OA disagrees: in his view, the effect of the repayment of the first loan  is that \nany loss arising from the first loan is extinguished together with any tortious claim \nin respect of the making of that loan. OA believes that the contention that the lender \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n261 \n can \"disregard\" or \"ignore\" the repayment of the first loan lacks any sound support \nin law, court practice or sound policy.”  \n1059.  In his cross -examination, Mr Howard explored Mr Beketov’s evidence as summarised \nin paragraph 46.1 of the joint statement.  He did so by putting to him a number of \nhypotheses, based on whether each of the first loan and the later loan used to repay the \nfirst loan was (a) valid, (b) valid but unlawful or (c) void.   In closing argument on behalf \nof Mr Kolomoisky it was submitted that Mr Beketov’s answers in cross -examination \nestablished that, if the Relevant Loans were valid, and they were repaid by the proce eds \nof later valid lending, each Borrower’s liability to repay a Relevant Drawdown was \ndischarged and any third party’s tortious liability for procuring the Relevant Drawdown \nwas extinguished.  I agree that, in that situation, Mr Beketov’s answers in cross -\nexamination were that, there was no distinction to be drawn between the effect of the \nrepayment on the Borrowers’ contractual liability under the Relevant Loan and its effect \non the harm caused by the loss of the proceeds of the Relevant Drawdown which wo uld \notherwise be recoverable in tort: both are extinguished.  \n1060.  However, the evidence that Mr Beketov gave orally was not explicitly qualified in the \nway that he had expressed matters in his reports .  In his reports he had said that, where \nthere were two unlawful but valid loans, both caused by the unlawful conduct of a third \nparty, the latter of which was used to repay the former, the lending bank could choose \nto sue in respect of either so long as it did not make a do uble recovery.  He had also \nsaid that there needed to be a genuine recovery by the victim, not sourced  from his own \nresources, for the tortious loss in respect of loan 1 to be extinguished.  \n1061.  The same line of reasoning as that referred to in paragraph 1059  above was then put to \nMr Beketov where the Relevant Loans were void.  In that situation, Ukrainian law does \nnot regard the transferee of the monies received from the Bank as a borrower with a \ncontractual obligation to repay, but treats it as a recipient of monies under a  \nrestitutionary obligation (pursuant to Article 216) to return them or their value as \ndamage suffered in connection with the execution of the invalid transaction.

In that \nsituation, Mr Beketov accepted that, if the recipient pays back the amount transferr ed \nunder the void transaction, his liability to make restitution to the original payer (in this \ncase the Bank) will then be extinguished.  \n1062.  Mr Beketov was then asked about the impact of this restitution on the Bank’s claim in \ntort against a third party who procured the original transfer.  Initially he explained \n(correctly) that the tortious harm may exceed the amount of the restored transfer \nbecause (e.g.,) the transferor may have sustained a loss of profit or incurred expense.  \nHowever, when he was asked to leave aside those types of harm, he accepted that, “The \nclaim would not be extinguished but the loss under the claim” would be.  This appe ared \nto be an unqualified answer and as such seemed to be inconsistent with the position \nespoused by Mr Beketov and summarised by the evidence he gave in paragraph 46.1 of \nthe joint statement.  \n1063.  However, when Mr Howard sought to summarise the effect of Mr Beketov’s evidence, \nit became clear that his answer to the question of whether the transferor’s loss was \nextinguished by the mere receipt of monies in discharge of the restitutionary obligation \nto repay, was affected by the question of whether or not what he called the victim’s \n“own resources ” were the source of repayment.  This became apparent during the \nfollowing exchange on the question of whether a tortious loss that would otherwise be \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n262 \n claimed against a third party arising out of both a valid and an invalid loan was \nextinguished both by repayment  if the  original loan was valid and by restitution of the \nmonies transferred if the original loan was  invalid:  \n“Q.  So I think where we get to, the position actually of  whether the loan that is \nbeing repaid is valid or void is actually the same, but the question is - or if ther e is \nin fact repayment of the loan, if it is a valid loan, or restitution of the monies taken, \nthe bank's loss in  respect of the taking of the monies pursuant to the loan, whether \nvalid or void, would be extinguished and  so any liability or any loss that could be \nclaimed against the tortfeasor will also be correspondingl y extinguished?  \nA. It would be right if again this extinguishing took place  with not, I would say, \nvictim’s own resources.  \nQ.  Well, the whole of the questions, Mr Beketov - every single question that I've \nasked you about this - and you know that - has been based upon the source of  \nrepayment being another unlawful loan from the bank.   Every single question has \nbeen on that basis and I’ve made that clear.  \nA.  Mr Howard, but in your proposed scenario -- actually you  did not.  When you \nput me those questions about  discharge by restitution of loss, actually you did not \nsay that  this is because money were taken from the  victim of tort to do so.  \nQ.  I did, and the transcript will show that and I ’m not,  Mr Beketov, going to go \nback over ground that we hav e trodden.  \nA.

Mr Beketov continued to maintain that position during the next part of his cross -\nexamination, protesting that Mr Howard had not made clear that his earlier questioning \nwas based on the hypothesis that , even if the subsequent loan used to repay the earlier \nloan was wrongful , it was not put on the basis that the source of the monies used to \nmake the subsequent loan was the Bank’s own monies.  He said:  \n“ … some questions which yo u put to me, I should say, were on a narrow \nproposition and I repeated several times that’s in a narrow sense.  I took it as we \nare not discussing the situation of where discharge of restitutional obligation under \nthe loan 1 was  via money obtained under fraudulent loan 2 as you put it with Mr \nHunter.  I thought that this situation were actually money were obtained from other  \nsource and I thought it is a matter of principle.  And  as a matter of principle, if you \ncan repay money from  another source and this is only damage which you suffer - I \nmean victim suffer with those monies, the n it is r ight, these were right answers.  \nBut, you know,  a very different answer would be if money come from victim's own \nresource. ” \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n263 \n 1065.  In that situation, Mr Beketov’s evidence  was that there would be no genuine repayment \nand the ban k can elect whether to bring a claim in respect of the loss caused by loan 1 \nor loan 2.   Mr Alyoshin disagreed in the sense that he asserted that, if void loan 2 is \nused to repay void loan 1, then the tortious liability of the individual who procured void \nloan 1 is extinguished  and he insisted that the re was a “consistent practice of Ukrainian \ncourts that sources of the funds [for repayment] practically doesn’t matter” .  However, \nhe did not refer to any cases which concern ed void lending  and his position on the point \nseemed to  me to be unprincipled , not least because  its premise was that the Bank’s loss \nfor the purpose of a claim under Article 1166 is coterminous with the contractual \nliability under the valid loan, an opinion which I agree is wr ong because the contractual \nliability of the borrower may be extinguished without the lender receiving full \ncompensation for the tortious loss.   I preferred the evidence of  Mr Beketov on the point . \n1066.  It follows that Mr Beketov’s evidence continued to be consistent with what the Bank \nhas always submitted was  the essential fallacy in the Repayment  Defence .  That defence  \npresents a series of further fraudulent loans, purportedly made out of what Mr \nBeketov’s called  the Bank’s own resources  under which no assets were contributed to \nthe Bank, as a genuine repayment  and/or the  full compensation  to which it is entitled \nunder Article 1166 .  I agree that, i n advancing that case, the Individ ual Defendants have \nnot established th at what they cha racterise as repayment s were anything other than steps \nto cover up what had been done before , nor that the Bank has received  any genuine \nvalue by way of compensation.  \n1067.  I also think that the Bank is correct to submit that the Defendant s’ cases  on this point \nconfuse full compensation for the purposes of the Bank’s claim under Article 1166 , \nwith the quite different question of what is recorded by book entries  made to cover up \nwhat occurred, including , in relation to all of the Relevant Loans, the Intermediary \nLoans and the New Loans , the absence of any real value .  I also agree that the \nRepayment Defence can only succeed if and to the extent that the so called repayment s \nwere in truth what they purported to be.   I am satisfied that they were not.  Unli"}

I also agree that the \nRepayment Defence can only succeed if and to the extent that the so called repayment s \nwere in truth what they purported to be.   I am satisfied that they were not.  Unlike a \ngenuine repayment of a loan, what occurred did not in any meaningful sense constitute \na repayment nor did it provide compensation for the harm which had been caused to the \nBank by the Defendants’ unlawful acts.  \n1068.  As Mr Hunter put it in his oral closing submissions for the Bank : “The Intermediary \nand New L oans provided no benefit to the Bank. … They cannot possibly be regarded \nas compensation. … If one looks at the substance of these, nothing comes in and all you \nend up with is one set of purpor ted but void loans being replaced with another .”  I agree \nand I also agree that t he true position can be  summarised as follows:   \ni) The Relevant Drawdowns were recorded as repaid in the Bank’s books by a \ncombination of other  Relevant Drawdowns (which have been taken into account \nin reducing the Bank’s right to compensation i n order to avoid double recovery) , \nthe Intermediary Drawdowns, New Loans and the attributed value of \nTransferred Assets . \nii) The Intermediary Drawdowns under the Relevant and Intermediary Loans \nconstituted void transactions because they were authorised and procured by  the \nIndividual Defendants  for the purpose of concealing the harm which had been \ncaused to the Bank  by unlawful act s in the form of the authorising and procuring \nof the Relevant Drawdowns . The Intermediary Borrowers were worthless shell \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n264 \n companies controlled by the Individual Defendants with no assets and no \nprospects of repaying the Intermediary Drawdowns. A promise from an \nIntermediary Borrower to repay a loan or a restitutionary obligation owed by an \nIntermediary Borrower was worthless.  \niii) The New Loans also constituted void transactions because they were authorised \nand procured by the Individual Defendants for the purpose of concealing the \nharm which had been caused to the Bank by unlawful acts  in the form of the \nauthorising and procuring of the Relevant Drawdowns .  The New Borrowers \nwere also shell companies controlled by the Individual Defendants with no \nassets and no prospects of repaying the New Loans .  Indeed the experts were \nagreed that  only around US$2.2m of principal has ever been pa id in respect of \nthe New Loans .  The New Loans are  now fully impaired in the Bank’s financial \nstatements and the experts are agreed that the New Loans were and are \nworthless . \niv) As I shall explain in more detail later in this judgment , the Individual Defendants \nprocured the transfer of the Transferred Assets to the Bank at inflated values.  \nThis was done for the purpose of disguising the true nat ure of what had occurred.  \n1069.  In my judgment, even where the contractual debts purportedly created by the Relevant \nDrawdowns are recorded  as repaid by Intermediary Drawdowns, Transferred Assets or \nNew Loans , Ukrainian law does not automatically reduce the amount for which the \nBank is entitled to be compensated for the harm it was caused by the unlawful conduct \nin permitting or procuring the Relevant Drawdowns. In other words, t he fact that the \nIndividual Defendants authorised and  procured the Intermediary Drawdowns , the New \nLoans  and the transfer of the Transferred Assets  at inflated values , and the fact that they \nthen authorised and procure d the Bank to record those transaction s as reducing or \nextinguishing  the amounts payable as a result of the Relevant Drawdowns , does not \nreduc"}

Part of the reason for this is that I do not accept that the Borrowers’ liability in debt or \nrestitution is co -extensive with Individual Defendant s’ liability in tort.   This is one of \nthe cons equences of Mr Beketov’s evidence, which I accept, that , if the source of the \nso-called repayment is the Bank itself , the elimination of the former will not of itself \neliminate the later.  As a matter of Ukrainian law, an individual who procures a \nfraudulent loan has a liability in tort which subsists even if the borrower has settled its \ncontractual (or restitutionary) liability to the lender, unless that settlement provides full \ncompensation for the tortious harm , which it will not do if th e source of the settle ment \nis the lender’s own funds .  It was submitted by the Bank, and I agree , that t he fact that \nthe tortfeasor’s liability is initially measured as the same sum as that extracted under \nthe fraudulent loan is nothing  to the point . \n1071.  The fact that Ukrainian law does not treat the two liabilities as co -extensive is also \nconsistent with Ukoopspilka , the relevant aspects of which  I have already identified  in \nparagraph  951 above .  The Grand Chamber found that, on the facts of th at case, there \nwould have been no point in the DGF pursuing claims against the sellers of the bonds  \nand that, even if such claims had been made , they would not  have mitigate d the loss.  It \nis difficult to see why the same reasoning would not be applicable if the DGF had \npursued restitutionary claims but had failed to make a recovery or had settled for a small \namount for pragmatic reasons .  I agree with the Bank’s submission that w hat is clear \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n265 \n from the decision is that the right to compen sation  under  Article 1166 is treated as \ndifferent from the restitutionary claims, and falls to be assessed as a matter of fact.  \n1072.  I also do not accept the Defendants’ submission  that this articulation of the Bank’s \nclaim confuses what might be cha racterised as the Bank’s ‘overall’ loss ( i.e., that which \nwas caused  by the net effect of the Relevant Drawdowns , the Intermediary Drawdowns \nand the New Loans) with  the particular loss caused to the Bank by the Relevant \nDrawdowns  alone .  This has some significan ce because the Defendants all claimed that \nthe Bank had quite deliberately structured its claim to sue for the harm it was caused by \nthe Relevant Drawdowns (and only the Relevant Drawdowns) in order to bolster its \ncase for English jurisdiction based on the role of the English Defendants , a point to \nwhich I have already alluded and to which I will revert .  I agree that there is no such \nconfusion.  The Bank’s claim is for the loss caused by the Relevant Drawdown s, while \nit says that the Intermediary Drawdowns and the New Loans were no more than a means \nof disguising that misappropriation.   In those circumstances, I accept that it cannot be  \nsaid that the Intermediary Drawdowns and the New Loans extinguished th e Bank’s loss \nfor the harm it suffered from the Relevant Drawdowns because they provided no new \nmoney and no real compensation.  \n1073.

The Defendants also submitted that the Intermediary Loans and the New Loans cannot \nbe treated as if they never existed because funds were in fact advanced under them and \nin the case of the New Loans they resulted in the repayment of US $ loans with UAH \nloans .  I do not think that this submission is correct , because, as  I have already \nexplained , the Intermediary Loans and the New Loan s were always void .  Of course on \none view it is not possible to airbrush them out of history  (as Mr Howard put it) , but a s \na matter of Ukrainian law, the consequence  is that they  are to treated  as if th ey had \nnever existed  (subject only to the legal consequences associated with the ir invalidity, \nsuch as restitution and liability in damages pursuant to Article 216(2): see paragraph \n970 above ). \n1074.  The Defendants also submitted that , if the Bank is right, it would cause a problem with \ndouble recovery, because the Bank could claim against the Individual Defendants for \nthe tortious loss caused by the Relevant Drawdowns, but it could also then sue the \nIntermediary Borrowers or New Borrow ers on their restitutionary (or if not void \ncontractual) obligations  under the New Loans.   Mr Beketov ’s answer to this , which I \naccept , is that a Ukrainian  court would  deal with this by ensuring that a claimant does \nnot double -recover:  \n“There is no rule of Ukrainian law that would oblige the victim in such \ncircumstances  to sue the wrongdoer in relation to one instance of misappropriation \nrather than the other; the victim could choose which instance of misappropriation \nto sue upon, but would not be permitted to double recover. ” \n1075.  He later explained that  “the mere existence of a risk of double recovery will not operate \nas a bar to a claimant pursuing multiple claims” but that  Ukrainian law adopts a number \nof different techniques to ensure that double recovery does not occur.  This is a coherent \nresponse to a common problem where a claimant  has right to sue multiple wrongdoers \non multiple causes of action and I am satisfied that Mr Beketov’s view represents the \nlaw of Ukraine.   In any event, as the Bank pointed ou t, it is fanciful to suppose that the \nBank will make any meaningful recover y from the Intermediary Borrowers or the New \nBorrowers  (see paragraph 1068.iii)  above) .  They are shell entities owned and \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n266 \n controlled by the Individual De fendants, and n o claims have been brought against them \nin any event . \n \nThe Repayment Defence: genesis of the Defendants’ case on choice  \n1076.  A little later in his cross -examination of Mr Beketov, Mr Howard tried a slightly \ndifferent tack.  He posited two void “loans” of US$1 million each (loan A and loan B) \nand a payment back to the lending bank of US$1 million.  In that situation, Mr Beketov \nagreed that the hypothetical lending bank was then entitled to choose whether to treat \nthe US$1 million which came back as repaying the restitutionary liability that arose in \nrespect of loan A or the restitutionary liability that arose in respect of loan B.   He also \nagreed that, in the situation  where the bank cho osee to treat the US$1  million as  \nrepaying the res titutionary liability  in respect of loan A , the bank would then no longer \nhave any rights to restitution in respect of loan A because it has recovered the monies \nwhich were originally transferred pursuant to loan A.  \n1077.  It was then put to him that it must follow that , in this example, the lending b ank would \nno longer have any claim in tort against the person responsible for procuring loan A, \nbecause it no longer had any "}

It was then put to him that it must follow that , in this example, the lending b ank would \nno longer have any claim in tort against the person responsible for procuring loan A, \nbecause it no longer had any  loss in respect of loan A. This can now be seen to be the \nsource of the Defendants ’ new case on free -choice.  Mr Beketov’s answer to this was as \nfollows:  \n“ … if it may be taken as a true fact that in such way bank decided that it  has to be \ncompensated,  in other words that the bank is fine that it is repaid  with its own \nmoney for this tort and there is evidence  that that in fact happened, there was the \nwill of the  bank to do so, then I believe any lender in such  situation would have \ndifficulty to claim this loss.  I ’m saying that the bank would have difficulty to claim \nsuch loss.” \n1078.  In giving this answer, Mr Beketov appeared to be saying that the hypothetical lending \nbank needed to have consciously chosen to discharge the liability in tort with its own \nmoney in order for the repayment to have that effect.  There continued to be some \nconfusion in the answers as to whether the bank needed to have intended to treat the \nrepayment of loan A not just as discharging the liability of the borrower but also as \nextinguishing the liability of any third party against whom the bank had a claim in to rt.  \nEven the final exchange on this point resulted in answers which did not produce a very \nclear  answer, because it did not clearly distinguish between the bank’s restitutionary \nclaim against the borrower and the bank’s claim in tort against the third party for \nprocuring the original payment or loan to be made .  That exchange  took the following \nform:  \n“Q. If the facts show that the creditor has in fact made its  choice, so it has chosen \nin fact that, on my example,  the US$1 million that came in should be treated as  \ncrediting against the liability of borrower A for  instance - if it does that, it can't \nthen ignore that and say, “Well, actually, although I credited borrower A's liability, \nI now want to sue the tortfeasor in respect of loan A ”, because it's too late, isn ’t it?  \nOnce you've made that choice, any loss in respect of  loan A has been extinguished?  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n267 \n A.  Mr Howard, I believe it's a matter of fact to decide,  but, you know, as we \ndiscussed before, if the borrower A  made it explicit that it was his intention to treat \nrepayment for the fraudulent loan A in such way, I believe it would be difficult for \nhim to sue for the  same loan in the court, if he accepts on some factual patterns that \nthis is actually discharge of his claim in  tort which he had.  \nQ.  The bank - you mean if the bank has done that, so if  the bank has treated the \npayment as discharging the  liability of a borrower in respect of loan A, he couldn't \nthen come along and either sue that borrower in  respect of loan A or sue a party \nwho procured it,  claiming the loss, because there is no loss; correct?  \nA.  Again, you know, if you please be more clear what you  refer to the loss because, \nyou know, I said we have three items of loss.  \nQ.  Yes, the loss in category one.  \nA.  The loss in category one, yes. ” \n1079.  This last exchange opened up the Defendants’  new case on choice .  It seems to me that, \ntaken in isolation, Mr Beketov’s very last answer might be thought to have accepted \nthat the choice by the bank to treat the US$1 million repayment as a discharge of the \nborrower’s restitutionary liability in relation to loan A, in and of itself extinguished the \nbank’s claim in tort against the third party for the loss s"}

The reason is that he  accepted Mr Howard’s proposition that, in that  situation, the \nbank could not then sue a party who procured loan A, “claiming the loss”, because \n(ignoring any compensation for loss of profit or expenses incurred) there is no loss.  \n1080.  However, I do not think that  this was in fact the case, because in the preceding answer \nhe seems to have said that what the bank chose to do must relate to the discharge of the \nactual claim which the bank had, by which it is clear that he meant the claim in tort \nagainst the third party.  In my view, M r Beketov’s opinion continued to be that the \nevidence must show that a payment  in discharge of a borrower’s liability to the bank \n(whether in contract if loan A was valid, or in restitution if it was not) was a ccepted by \nthe bank in repayment or discharge of that liability to the borrower in what he called a \n“factual pattern” which also amounted to an acceptance that it actually discharged the \nbank’s  claim in  tort against the third party.   In many cases that will amount to the same \nthing, but I do not think that he accepted that that would always be the case and in my \njudgment it is not . \n1081.  In my judgment , the essential substance of Mr Beketov’s evidence  on the effect of the \nrepayments on the  Bank’s claim under Article 1166 in circumstances in which the \nRelevant Loans were (as I have held them to be) void , was as follows .  In each instance, \nI accept that this evidence reflects the law of Ukraine : \ni) Whether the source of what was said to be a repayment was an Intermediary \nDrawdown made under a Relevant Loan or an  Intermediary Loan , or the value \nof a Transferred  Asset , or one of the  New Loans issued as part of the \nTransformation , it will not serve to reduce o r extinguish the Bank’s claim in tort \nif it was improperly paid out of the Bank’s own resources . \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n268 \n ii) The mere choice by the Bank to treat what is said to be a repayment of a void \nloan as a discharge of the borrower’s restitutionary liability in relation to that \nloan, does not in and of itself extinguis h the Bank’s claim in tort against the third \nparty for the loss sustained in the amount of the loan.  \niii) The position may be different if the Bank chooses or consents to the use of what \nis said to be a repayment as a discharge of its claim in tort . \n1082.  It is important to note that what would be required to establish choice or consent by the \nBank was never explored in the evidence either by way of application to the facts of the \npresent case or by  reference to general principles of Ukrainian law.  \n \nThe Repayment Defence: the Defendants’ case on choice  \n1083.  As a starting point, it is now clear that there  has been a material shift in the way in \nwhich the Defendants approached the Repayment Defence during the course of the trial, \nalthough the extent of the shift and its potential significance was not fully apparent until \nthe service of the Defendants’ written closings.  As I have already explained, i t was Mr \nKolomoisky’s case in opening that, whatever the harm or loss that the Bank may have \nsustained in respect of the Relevant Drawdowns, it is extinguished to th e extent of any \nrepayment of a Relevant Loan.

As I have already explained, i t was Mr \nKolomoisky’s case in opening that, whatever the harm or loss that the Bank may have \nsustained in respect of the Relevant Drawdowns, it is extinguished to th e extent of any \nrepayment of a Relevant Loan.  He relied on the Bank’s transactional data to prove the \nrepayments for which he contended that credit is to be given.  This disclosed (as the \nforensic experts all agreed) that all but two of the Relevant Loans  and all of the \nIntermediary Loans were recorded as having been repaid  by the various means I have \njust described .  His case was that these repayments had the effect of both discharging \nthe Borrowers ’ liabilities to the Bank and extinguishing any tortious liability the \nDefendants’ may have had in relation to the making of the Relevant Loans in the first \nplace.  If any of the Defendants had any tortious liability to the Bank flowing from the \nharm caused by the making of the Relevant Loans, that liability was  extinguished by \nperformance of the Borrowers’ obligation to repay the Relevant Drawdowns.  \n1084.  The way that the Repayment Defence was articulated in the various iterations of Mr \nKolomoisky’s Defence and his opening submissions was that, when a Relevant \nDrawdown was repaid (by whatever means that was achieved), any loss caused by it \nwas reduced or extinguished.  It did not matter whether the Relevant Loan was valid, \nvoidable or void.  That simply went to the q uestion of whether the Relevant Drawdown \ngave rise to a debt which was repaid or a restitutionary obligation which was then \nperformed on repayme nt.  In both instances, the cause of action in tort for harm caused \nby the Relevant Drawdown was automatically extinguished by the repayment because \nthe loss constituting an essential element of the claim under Article 1166 was also \nextinguished.  \n1085.  It was submitted on Mr Kolomoisky ’s behalf in opening that it did not matter if the \nsource of the repayment was an Intermediary Loan or a New Loan itself obtained \nunlawfully and procured in breach of duty by a third party.  If that were to have been \nthe case, the Bank may have a claim against that third party in tort for procuring the \nIntermediary Loan or the New Loan to be made, but that would be for the loss it \nsustained caused by the making of the Intermediary Loan or the New Loan, not the loss \nit sustai ned by the making of the Relevant Loan because that loss would have been \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n269 \n extinguished by the repayment. Mr Kolomoisky has always said that the reason the \nBank has never put its case on the basis that it sustained any loss from the making of \nthe Intermediary Loan s or the New Loan s is because the Bank would have run into \njurisdictional difficulties in suing in England if it had done so.  It has therefore both \nelected to confine its claims to loss caused by the Relevant Drawdowns, which on the \nDefendants’ case have been repaid, and e schewed any claim in relation to the \ntransactions  which were the source of the repayments.  \n1086.  In opening its case, the Bank made clear that its answer to this fundamental point was \nthat recorded repayments of the Relevant Loans by Intermediary Drawdowns and New \nLoans did not reduce the Bank’s loss and did not constitute a genuine recovery because \nthey involved unlawful extractions of the Bank’s mo ney and therefore no credit was to \nbe given for what are described as “such purported repayments”.  The reason that there \nwas no genuine recovery was that there was no genuine repayment in the form of \nexternal funds paid back into the Bank;  they were to b e disregarded, because they were \nmade with funds derived from another fraudulent loan.  It said that, as a matter of fact, \nit has not received anything of "}
{"start": 1008000, "text": "te a genuine recovery because \nthey involved unlawful extractions of the Bank’s mo ney and therefore no credit was to \nbe given for what are described as “such purported repayments”.  The reason that there \nwas no genuine recovery was that there was no genuine repayment in the form of \nexternal funds paid back into the Bank;  they were to b e disregarded, because they were \nmade with funds derived from another fraudulent loan.  It said that, as a matter of fact, \nit has not received anything of real value which would make it whole.  It still has a \nworthless fraudulent loan on its books.   In my judgment, that answer was plainly a good \none as a matter of Ukrainian law.  It reflects the reality of the position which is that the \nBank never received full compensation for the harm which it suffered at the time the \nRelevant Drawdown was made.  \n1087.  In Mr Kolomoisky’s closing submissions, there was a substantial change in the way he \nsought to put his case.  Choice entered into the equation for the first time.  It was said \nin a part of his written closing submissions that was specifically adopted by Mr \nBogolyubov and the Corporate Defendants that, where a Relevant Loan was void with \nthe conseque nce that the Bank’s claim for recovery was in restitution, the creditor can \nchoose whether to apply a repayment in discharge of the relevant Borrower’s \nrestituti onary liability or some other liability.  The way it was put was that: \n“such a liability is not automatically extinguished by a repayment: instead the \ncreditor can choose whether to account for the payment as a discharge of the \nrestitutionary liability, or of some other liability. It is a question of fact what choice \nthe cred itor has made.”  \n1088.  This made clear that it was no longer Mr Kolomoisky’s case that where the loan was \nvoid, repayment automatically extinguish ed any liability in tort for harm caused by the \noriginal transfer .   It is then said that, if that choice is made, not only is the liability of \nthe Borrower discharged but also any tortious loss caused by third parties such as the \nDefendants, is extinguished.   This was  said to be justified by Mr Beketov’s evidence \nwhich was said to be to the effect that if the creditor makes a choice to accept a \nrepayment as discharging the liability of a borrower in respect of the earlier of two void \nloans, it cannot later make a claim in tort against a third party who procured the void \nloan.  \n1089.  Therefore, the  ultimate significance of the Bank’s choice when applying a payment in \ndischarge of the Borrower’s restitutionary liability, together with the relevance of that \nchoice to the extinction of any tortious loss, was only explicitly introduced into Mr \nKolomoisk y’s case in his written closing.  The importance of this point from the \nperspective of Mr Kolomoisky was summarised in his written closing submissions as \nfollows:  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n270 \n “If the Relevant Loans are void th en the effect of Mr Beketov’s evidence is that the \nBank has suffered no loss in respect of the Relevant Loans if and to the extent that \nit has chosen to accept payments as discharging the Relevant Borrower’s liabilities \nto return the sums drawn down under t he Relevant Loans, as opposed to other \nliabilities in respect of the later loans.  \n“The key question on this analysis is therefore a factual one, namely whether the \nBank has indeed made that choice. The answer to that that is self -evidently ‘Yes’: \n…” \n1090.  Mr Kolomoisky then went on to make clear that he did not rely for the purposes of \nestablishing the Bank’s choice as a matter of fact on the initial credit of the relevant \nBorrower’s account with repayment while the Bank was owned and controlled by him.  \nRather he relied on the fact that the Bank had an opportunity, when new management \nwas appointed following nationalisation at the end of 2016, to decide which loans to"}

Mr Kolomoisky then went on to make clear that he did not rely for the purposes of \nestablishing the Bank’s choice as a matter of fact on the initial credit of the relevant \nBorrower’s account with repayment while the Bank was owned and controlled by him.  \nRather he relied on the fact that the Bank had an opportunity, when new management \nwas appointed following nationalisation at the end of 2016, to decide which loans to \ntreat as valid and repaid.  It was said that, at that stage, the Bank consciously decided \nto treat the New Loans as valid and outstanding and the Relevant Loans to the original \nBorrowers as having been repaid.  It did so at the latest when its new management \nsigned off the Bank’s 2016 financial statements on 25 May 2017.  \n1091.  The Bank strongly objected to this way of putting the Defendants’ case.  It said that no \nsuch case was pleaded and no application to amend had been made by the Defendants.  \nMr Hunter took me through the pleadings with some care and I agree that the case wa s \nalways pleaded on the basis that purported repayments of Relevant Loans funded by \nIntermediary Loans, New Loans and Asset Transfers automatically extinguished any \nloss caused by the Relevant Transfers for which the Defendants would otherwise have \nbeen li able in tort.  The very fact of what the Defendants said were repayments, effected \nby the cash funded by the Intermediary Loans, the Asset Transfers and the \nTransformation, was all that was relied on.  There was no mention of a post -\nnationalisation consent .  The Bank is also correct to submit that the List of Issues for \nthe trial (of which there were many) made no mention of a post -nationalisation free -\nchoice argument.  \n1092.  I also agree that, although the Defendants pleaded some post -nationalisation conduct \nby the Bank, this pleading was advanced for the quite different purpose of articulating \nwhat was then their case on preclusion.  Those pleas were made in order to explain the \nDefendants’ case on abuse of rights and venire contra factum proprium  in the context \nof the Bank ’s case that the Relevant Loans, the Intermediary Loans and the New Loans \nwere all void , a plea  for which proof of bad faith by the Bank and detrimental rel iance \nwould have been required.   The allegation was that because, as against the relevant \ncounterparties, the Bank had treated the Relevant Loans, the Intermediary Loans and \nthe New Loans as valid and had treated them as having been wholly or partially repaid, \nit was precluded from asse rting that they were in fact void.  I agree that this is a quite \ndifferent argument from the free -choice argument, not least because the free -choice \nargument takes as its premise that the loans are void and that the Bank is not precluded \nfrom making a case to that effect.  \n1093.  It was also said that, in making that submission, the Bank was not relying on a mere \ntechnicality.  The Bank submitted that, if the Defendants had sought permission to \namend, they should and would have been required to plead out (a) the Ukrainian law \nbasis for what it called the Defendants’ new free -choice extinction of loss case, (b) the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n271 \n conduct on which they relied as amounting to a free choice by reference to the \nknowledge required for the choice to be free, (c) how unequivocal the choice would \nhave to be and (d) who would have been authorised to choose (given the evidence \nalready adduced as to the restrictions on authority contained in t he Charter and the Law \non Banks).  The Defendants would also have been required to plead who at the Bank \nthey say made the choice  freely  and when, what knowledge such persons had of the \ntrue facts and wha t acts are said to amount to the free  choice or the manifestation of it.  \n1094.

The consequence of the Defendants’ case not being pleaded, or even articulated in this \nway in its opening submissions, is that the Bank did not adduce any expert evidence as \nto what a free -choice might be in the circumstances, what knowledge the persons \nresponsible for making the choice would need to have had and what formalities in \nrelation to that choice would need to be fulfilled.  Mr Hunter also submitted that, if the \ncase had been plead ed in this way, he would have explored the Ukrainian law points \nwhich arose in cross -examination of Mr Alyoshin and his clients would have adduced \nevidence from the individuals who are said to have made the choice on behalf of the \nBank.   I accept this submission.  If the Defendants’ case on the significance of post -\nnationalisation conduct now sought to be advanced had been pleaded, it is inevitable \nthat the Bank would have wanted to put in expert evidence on the point and the court \nwould not have been faced with the unsatisfactory extraction of somewhat ambiguous \nevidence from Mr Beketov .  In my judgment, even if an application to amend had been \nmade , which it was not, it would have been refused on the grounds that to allow the \nDefendants to advance this unpleaded and unheralded argument at a very late stage \nwould have caused real  prejudic e to the Bank . \n1095.  The Bank also submitted that such evidence as there was as to what in fact happened \nwas that nobody at the Bank exercised a free choice to give up the claims it had started \nto investigate arising out of the Misappropriation.  This would have required a fully \ninformed decision by the Bank to accept wholly impaired loans to shell companies as \ncompensation in pla ce of the compensation to which it would otherwise have been \nentitled as a result of the claims it was then investigating.  This is a wholly improbabl e \nscenario , so that , even if permission to amend had been sought, which it was not, it \nwould not have been granted.   In my judgment these are all powerful reasons why the \nDefendants should not be permitted to argue the Repayment Defence in the way that \nthey now seek to d o.   \n \nFacts on which the Defendants rely to establish the Bank’s choice  \n1096.  One of the many problems with the Defendants’ submissions on the facts is that they \nwere made in a context which required , but did not have , a proper focus on the \napplicable underlying legal principles.  The whole thesis was founded on what was said \nto have been critical evidence from Mr Beketov, the difficulties with which I have \nalready explained in paragraphs 1077 ff, and as I have also already explained there was \nno evidence as to what a free -choice might look like  in the circumstances, how it needs \nto be manifested and to whom, whether there are any requirements for reliance and so \non.  These kinds of question are well -illustrated by the parties’ submissions (now no \nlonger relied on for this purpose) on the issue o f whether an application of the Ukrainian \nlaw doctrine of venire contra factum proprium , and the equivalent English principle \nthat a party cannot approbate and reprobate , means that the Bank is prevented from \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n272 \n contending that the Relevant Loans, the Intermediary Loans and the New Loans were \nall void.  \n1097.

In that context, the Bank accepted that there are principles of English law which limit \na party’s ability to pursue inconsistent conduct, including (i) election between mutually \ninconsistent rights (e.g. the doctrines of waiver and election); (ii) election  after \njudgment between inconsistent remedies (e.g. the choice between damages and an \naccount of profits); and (iii) the equitable doctrine of election which prevents a person \nfrom taking the benefit of a disposition under an instrument while rejecting oth er \nconditions contained in the instrument (as described in Snell’s Equity, at [6 -015ff]). \nHowever, these all have different requirements and it is submitted with some force that \nMr Kolomoisky has not pleaded or particularised his reliance on any of those principles \nand they could not sensibly be invoked to preclude the Bank from bringing it s claim \nagainst the Individual Defendants in these proceedings.  The fact that the Bank (and the \ncourt) have been put in this position by the manner in which the Defendan ts have sought \nto change their defence, combined with the absence of any application to amend their \nDefences in order to do so, is of course a very good reason for the court to conclude \nthat they should not be allowed to run the point in this way at this stage.  \n1098.  Nonetheless , counsel for Mr Kolomoisky made a number of submissions on the point \nduring the course of their writte n and oral closing argument s and  I think it is still \nappropriate to make a number of findings about the submissions that were made .  In \nparticular, I should explain why I agree that the factual basis for the allegation that the \nBank made the choice alleged is not established by them on the evidence, which is a \nfurther reason why it is not open to Mr Kolomoisky  to pursue the point in the manner \nhe has . \n1099.  In support of their unpleaded claim that  the Bank consciously decided to treat the New \nLoans as valid and outstanding and the loans  to the 193 Borrowers as having been \nrepaid , the Defendants relied on evidence relating to the Bank’s post -nationalisation \nconduct , and in particular the extent of the new management’s knowledge of the \nallegation that had been made in relation to the loan recycling scheme and the \nMisappropriation .  Some  of this evidence was also said to be relevant to part of the \nLimitation Defence, but for present purposes the focus is on how what occurred is  said \nto support  the Defendants’ case that the Bank made the conscious post -nationalisation \nchoice  alleged.   It falls into two parts: the information of which the Bank’s post -\nnation alisation management was aware and  the steps taken by them which are said to \nhave amounted to a choice .  \n1100.  The first document on which the Defe ndants  relied for that purpose  was the EY \nNovember 2016  report , which  concluded , amongst other things , that some of the assets \ntransferred to the Bank to repay outstanding loans had been  overvalued  and that, b y the \nend of 2016 , almost all of the Borrowers  and Intermediary Borrowers had been \ncategorised by the NBU as companies used to “transit funds ” on behalf of the Individual \nDefendants .  This had been reported  to the Bank  in the NBU’s 14 December 2016 r eport \non related parties  (see paragraph 581 above) .  It was then said that , by the end of January \n2017, the Bank’s new management had been briefed on these matters by the NBU , with \nreference amongst other things to  the claim s which appeared to be available to the Bank .   \n1101.

In support of their submission that all of this information was available to the Bank’s \nnew management, the  Defe ndant s relied on Ms Rozhkova ’s evidence to the effect that , \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n273 \n at the time of nation alisation, it was very important for the new management to be \ninformed of the NBU’s conclusion that the allegation s originally made  in the Glavcom \nArticle were true .  She also said in her evidence that she believed that the new \nmanagement of the Bank did understand the real situation , because of the materials \nwhich had been submitted by the NBU to the Bank  (including the EY November 2016 \nReport, the Restructuring Plan and the NBU’s stress testing results) , all of which were \navailable fo r their review.   The availability  of this material  was confirmed by Mr \nOleksiyenko and Ms Pakhachuk in cross -examination . \n1102.  Furthermore , it was clear from the evidence given by  Mr Oleksiyenko that one of the \nfirst things the Bank’s new management was told was  that the Bank's management had \nbeen making management decisions which were designed to benefit the Individual \nDefendants as the Bank's shareholders , and that  the documents available to them \nincluded  the NBU’s two July 2016 audit report s, one of which included a finding that \n“the Bank [had been] an instrument for raising funds for lending to a wide range of \nparties related t o the Bank. Most of the corporate loan portfolio is scheme -based and \nsham”.  \n1103.  From or immediately after the time of their appointment, the extent of the understanding \nof the Bank’s new management  of the allegations made in these proceedings was \nestablished by the following exchange s during the course of Mr Oleksiyenko’s cross -\nexamination : \nQ. … Stage one, we agree, you probably saw the [NashiGroshi]  articles in February \n2015; correct?  \nA. Yes.  \nQ. Stage two -- let's see whether we agree with this –those articles made allegations  \nthat Mr Kolomoisky had misappropriated $1.8 billion -odd from the Bank via \narrangements with borrowers and suppliers who he controlled with sham supply \ncontracts; correct?  \nA. Correct.  \nQ. Those were allegations which I imagine you, as somebody at that stage  in \nFebruary 2015 who wasn't -- you weren't involved in Privat, but they were \nallegations which I imagine you would have found of interest, bearing in mind that \nPrivatBank was a bank of systemic importance and so on.  \nA. That's correct.  \nQ. Yes. So this is not something that -- when you come to November/December \n2016 and you're being invited to join this board, the supervisory board, you hadn't \nforgotten about that, had you?  \nA. With the -- I didn't remember details of the legal entities, size of the contracts \nand details of the individual loan and supply agreements, but in general the scheme \nwas in the recollection and I remembered it.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n274 \n Q. Yes. Perfectly understandable that you would not remember the specific details \nof the companies and the agreement numbers and so on, but the thrust of what had \nbeen said, namely that Mr Kolomoisky had misappropriated or procured the \nmisappropriation of 1.8 billion via this scheme, you had that well in mind; right?  \nA. Yes.  \nQ. Yes. So you also knew -- even if you couldn't remember the detail, you knew \nthat the detail was set out in that [NashiGroshi]  article?  \nA.

The Defendants also referred to the NBU’s Audit Report dated 27 January 2017,  which \nwas theref ore available to the Bank’s management from shortly after their appointment.  \nIt addressed a number of matters relating to the means by which loans to the 193 \nBorrowers (including as they did some Relevant and Intermediary Loans) had been \nrepaid including  concerns about  the overvaluation of Transferred Assets , concerns \nabout the Bank’s title to the Transferred Assets , specific concerns relating t o Hotel \nZirka, Hotel Mir  and the terms o n which aircraft had been transferred to a Cypriot \ncompany called Dilorsano Consulting Limited (“Dilorsano”), concerns about the \nsecurity for the New Loans , consisting as they did  of the pledge of rights to the supply \nof goods  and concerns that the New Loans had only artificially improved the Bank’s \nposition.  The Defendants relied on the fact that this audit report also recited that:  \n“the main achievement of the transformation is the currency restructuring and \nelimination of groupings of counterparties that are associated both with one another \nand with the Bank. However, the nature of the transactions performed and the \ninadequacy of th e scope of activity of new borrowers, which are generally newly \ncreated companies, testify to the artificiality of the above and the fact that the \ntransformation does not actually reduce the Bank’s risks”.  \n1105.  The Defendants also pointed out that Ms Pa khachuk had accepted in cross -examination \nthat, f rom 16 January  2017 , she had  fully appreciated that the New Borrowers could \nnot be relied on to repay the  New Loans, because they were not creditworthy , they had \nno recognisable business and no recognisable means, as fa r as she  understood it, of \nrepaying the m.  The Defendants then submitted that, in the light of what the Bank’s \nnew management knew about the Relevant Loans, the operation of the scheme  and what \nwas called the artificiality of the Transformation and the issue of the New Loans, the \nBank had what was described as an entirely free  choice .  The Bank  could simply have \ntreated the New Loans as null and void and left the 1 93 Borrowers’ loans (including \nRelevant Loans  and Intermediary Loans) as outstanding , or it could have reversed them . \n1106.  The Defendants the n submitted that, armed with the knowledge I have summarised \nabove,  the Bank  made a decision to treat the New Loans as creating liabilities which \nwere  outstanding but impaired, and to continue to treat the 193 Borrowers’ liabilities as \ndischarged .  This decision was made at the latest when the Bank’s 2016 f inancial \nstatements were signed on 25 May 2017.   It was submitted that this was probably done \nbecause there were commercial benefits to be obtained by the Bank from the \nTransformation , which it did not wish to relinquish.  The suggestion was made that  \nthese benefits were that  the Bank was now dealing with a smaller number of debtors \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n275 \n (36 rather than 193) and that all the New Loans were in UAH which, as Ms Rozhkova \nconfirmed  in oral evidence, protected the Bank from any further depreciation in the \ncurrency.  \n1107.

I should sa y straightaway that I have already addressed and rejected the Defendants ’ \nsuggestion that there were currency -related commercial benefits to be obtained by the \nBank from the Transformation in paragraphs 579 and 580 above.   I am equally sceptical \nthat there was any material commercial  benefit to the Bank in having a smaller number \nof debtors , particularly given the obvious issues as to the New Borrowers’ \ncreditworthiness that I have already described .  In the context of a case such as the \npresent , that seem s to me to be a largely irrelevant consideration . \n1108.  In any event, and leaving aside what might be the test under Ukrainian law, there was \nno proper analysis of how it was said that the Bank’s 2016 financial statements \nevidenced a n irrevocable free choice to treat obligations arising in relation to the \nRelevant Loans as wholly discharged, let alone to extinguish the tort claims against \nthose involved .  The notes simply recited the fact that  in October and November 2016, \npart of the loan portfolio to the value of UAH 137,082 million was r estructured , leading \nto a change in currency , a lower ing of the interest rates , an exten sion of maturity dates, \na conver sion of  some of the loans into finance lease s and a chang e in the collateral \npledged under the loans.   It was also recorded that , as at 31 December 2016, an \nallowance for impairment of the overwhelming face value  of this portfolio  was \nrecognised.  This was no more than an accounting recognition of what the \nTransformation had purported to achieve and its financial consequences.  In my view \nnone of this comes anywhere near an election , anyway as that concept applies as a \nmatter of English law,  to take any particular steps going forward  or a choice to treat \nanything done in respect of the New Loans as discharging the Borrowers’ liabilit y to \nreturn sums drawn down under the Relevant Drawdowns, let alone extinguish ing any \nliability in tort arising out of the circumstances in which they were drawn down.  \n1109.  However i t was said that the Bank has continued to maintain its position on the New \nLoans  by its continuing conduct throughout 2017 up until the commencement of these \nproceedings.  Thus, i t has sought to enforce the New Borrowers’ liabilities while \nseeking to negotiate the provision of security by the Individual Defe ndants , it has been \naccepting small repayments and it has been charging interest to the New Borrowers \nsince the date of the drawdown of funds under the New Loans. Furthermore, th e Bank \nhas issue d notices to the New Borrowers , relying on events of default to accelera te debts \nowed under the New Loan s. \n1110.  Particular reliance was placed on the fact that the Bank had begun to issue proceedings \nagainst New Borrowers in late 2017 before the Bank’s l egal department was told to stop \ndoing so  (see paragraph 609 above) ; the Defendants said that this stop instruction was \nlikely to have been  given because of  concerns about establishing English jurisdiction \nfor the claims which the Bank had by then de termined to pursue against the Defendants .  \nThe Defendants also said that, in disputes with New Borrowers which have reached the \nUkrainian Courts, the Bank has continued to treat the New Borrowers as liable under \nthe New Loans , and referred to a number of reported decisions of the Ukrainian \nCommercial  Court in which that has been done .

However,  it is worthy of  note that  the specific \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n276 \n proceedings actually relied on in Mr Kolomoisky’s closing submissions all reached the \nUkrainian courts long after the commencement of these proceedings, and all but one of \nthem (proceedings against Tamersa in relation to the validity of its Relevant Loan) were \nthemselves commenced after December 2017.  \n1111.  The Defendants also drew attention to the fact that, c onsistently with its decision to \ntreat the New Loans as creating actionable liabilities , the Bank has treated (largely by \ninaction) the liabilities of the Borrowers and the Intermediary Borrowers as fully \ndischarged , whether by the Asset Transfer s or the Transformation .  They said that n o \nclaims have been made against the Borrowers or the Intermediary  Borrowers in \nconnection with the Relevant Loans or the Intermediary Loans  as the case may be .  They \nalso asserted that the  Bank has n ever contended that the Borrowers or the Intermediary \nBorrowers continue to owe it money (either in contract or in restitution)  and has taken \nno steps to bring any claims against Mr Kolomoisky or any third party in relation to the \nover-valuation of the Transferred Assets.  They also said it is significant that the Bank \nhas been content to acknowledge in full the credits granted to  the Borrowers and the \nIntermediary Borrowers in return for Transferred Assets.  \n1112.  The position on this aspect of the case was said by the Defendants to have been \naccurately summarised in the following evidence given by Mr Oleksiyenko:  \n“Q. Generally -- is this  right? -- save insofar as there is some mistake about  \ncollateral or something like that having been  misapplied, the position is -- I think \nthis must be   right -- the Bank has not sought repayment from the  193 borrowers \nand has accepted that their liabilities  were entirely extinguished by the repayments \nthat were  made out of the proceeds of the loans to the new 36  borrowers; correct?  \nA. That's correct.  Furthermore, the new borrowers, before nationalisation and \nimmediately  after nationalisatio n started to service the new loan agreement.  \nQ. Yes.  And insofar as they serviced the new loan  agreement, the Bank, as it were, \nhas accepted any money  that they have paid and credited it to the account of  that \nborrower; correct?  \nA. That is correct.  It is not to the account of the  borrower but as a service vis -a-vis \nthe obligation of  the borrower. ” \n1113.  The Defendants then submitted, relying on all of the factors I have just summarised, \nthat there could be no doubt that the Bank has made its choice as a matter of fact to treat \nall repayments of Relevant Loans as effective in full, whether the source of those \nrepayments w as void Intermediary Loans, overvalued Transferred Assets or void New \nLoans.   It was said that it is only in these proceedings that the Bank is forced to adopt \nwhat was said to be an  inconsistent and  incoherent position that the repayments of the \nRelevant Drawdowns were somehow invalid  or could  be disregarded, in order to \ncontend that the loss in respect of which it has chosen to bring claims against the \nIndividual Defendants has not been extinguished.  \n1114.

The Defendants further submitted that t he choice to sue for that loss  on the false basis \nthat it had not been extinguished as a matter of Ukrainian law was  dictated by the \nBank’s desire to sue the Individual Defendants in England , rather than Ukraine.   But, \nas a matter of fact, repayments did take place and the Bank has accepted  them as \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n277 \n discharging the liability of the Borrowers in respect of the advances made to them, \nwhether that liability was in contract or in restitution , with the consequence that, in \nUkrainian law as in English law, any tortious loss in respect of those advances has also \nbeen fully and conclusively extinguished, and they are not therefore liable to the Bank \nin respect of it.  \n1115.  There was no challenge to the general description given by the Defendants of the \ninformation which was available to the Bank’s  new management at and shortly after \nnationalisation.  However, the Bank  did challenge the Defendants’ submission that the \nsteps which were taken by the Bank with the benefit of that information amounted to \nany form of free -choice election (whatever the correct formulation under Ukrainian law \nmight be) to treat the claims it had against the Defendants as extinguished or to choose \na claim against the New Borrowers as its sole remedy for compensation for the harm it \nsuffered as a result of the Defendants’ unlawful acts.  \n1116.  The Bank’s starting point was that, in both English and Ukrainian law, a party which \nhas sued on an agreement in order to recover debts (or has in fact recovered money \nunder a loan) is not thereby precluded from seeking to protect their rights by \nsubsequen tly invalidating the loan agreement and suing wrongdoers for loss.  I agree \nthat this is correct:  \ni) In Ukrainian law this is apparent from Chor nomornaftogaz  at [5.4.2] in which \nthe Supreme Court explained that the “existence of a court judgment recovering \ndebts from the Respondent under the Agreement does not restrict their right to \nsue for the invalidation of the Agreement and does not preclude the possibili ty \nof litigation in such a case, but on the contrary, indicates the need for this as the \nonly possible way for the Claimant to defend their rights and interest, which \nthey consider to have been violated”.  \nii) In English law the same principle was explained by Nourse LJ in Jyske Bank \n(Gibraltar) Ltd v . Spjeldnaes  (CA, 29 July 1999 at p.24 of the transcript) when \nhe said that “the suggestion that a bank, which, suspecting or even knowing that \nits moneys have, with the connivance of the borrowers, been fraudulently \nmisapplied in the guise of a loan, calls it in or t akes steps to preserve or enforce \nits security, thereby curtails its rights to recover its moneys, is absurd. It is \nentitled, without risk of nonsuiting  itself, to take every step available in order to \nachieve that end .” \n1117.  The Bank then submitted that the overriding answer to the Defendants ’ case on this area \nwas that, as a victim of a fraud, it had been doing all it could to mitigate the losses it \nwas caused by the Defendants’ unlawful conduct.  All the events relied on by the \nDefendants were simply short -term attempts to make recovery from the New Borrowers \nand nothing came close to manifesting an election or an unequivocal decision to waive \nclaims, which, on the unchallenged evidence of Ms Hryn and Mr Bondarenko ended \nshortly before these proceedings were issued.

It was said in the Bank’s closing \nsubmission that this “stop instruction” was given at that stage because  by then the \nEnglish solicitors instructed by the Bank, Hogan Lovells, had beg un to fully understand \nthe subject of the claims , which may or may not (as the Defendants suggested) have \ninclude d concerns about jurisdiction ; an inference which it is appropriate to draw.   \nNothing which occurred amounted to an unequivocal election to do anything.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n278 \n 1118.  I accept that it might have been possible (anyway theoretically) for the Bank to have \nelected to pursue the New Borrowers on the New Loans in a manner which meant that, \nas a matter of fact, it can be seen to have chosen to treat the Relevant Loans and the \nIntermediary Loans as discharged and/or the loss caused by the unlawful conduct of the \nDefendants in procuring or participating in the making of the Relevant Drawdowns as \nextinguished.

However, whatever the \nlegal principles to be applied to establish irrevocable choice or consent (and as I have \nsaid the Defendants have been very vague as to what they are said to have been), I am \nsatisfied that nothing done by the Bank in its pursuit of the New Loans comes anywhere \nnear establishing that that is what occurred.  \n1119.  A similar issue was examined  in the parties’ written submissions in some detail in the \nslightly different context of the Defendants ’ original argument that the Ukrainian law \ndoctrine of venire contra factum proprium  applied with the consequence that the Bank \nwas prevented from contending that the Relevant Loans, the Intermediary Loans and \nthe New Loans were all void.   There was an issue on the expert evidence as to whether \nor not this doctrine applied to void transactions at all, but it was plain that it co uld not \nhave been applied in that context in any event, because at least one of the essential \nelements of the defence was not present.  Thus, there was no evidence that any of the \nDefendants reasonably relied to their detriment on any of the statements mad e by the \nBank in the Ukrainian proceedings.  But I  also consider that the evidence adduced in \nthat context shows that, even if the Bank had treated the loans or mortgages as valid in \nthose Ukrainian proceedings, in pursuing them  it acted reasonably and in good faith \nwith a view to mitigating the harm for which it was entitled to compensation from the \nIndividual Defendants.   This is consistent with my conclusion that it is not possible to \nspell any form of consent of the type alleged by the De fendants out of the way  in which  \nthose proceedings have been pursued by the Bank.  \n1120.  As to  the proceedings actually relied on in Mr Kolomoisky’s closing submissions , the \nfacts that all but one of them dated from after the commencement of these proceedings \nand that  they all reached the Ukrainian courts long after that date, means that , on the \ncurrent issue , the Defe ndants’ argument is  a particularly weak one.  W hatever the \nprinciples that may apply in relation to  the venire contra factum proprium  defence, it is \nparticularly difficult to see how the timing of the commencement and progress  of those \nUkrainian proceedings  can point to any form of freely given consent to abando n or \n"}

In any event , there was very detailed evidence in Mr Beketov’s 11th report which dealt \nwith why the venire contra factum proprium  defence was not engaged by the Bank’s \nconduct of  any of th ose proceedings .  This only goes so far, because the issues were \nslightly different , relating as they did to the Bank’s ability to pursue its claim that the \nRelevant Loans were void , but it was not challenged  and demonstrates that Ukrainian \nlaw treats  any questio n relating to whether conduct may have the effect of causing an \notherwise available claim to be abandoned, extinguished or discharged, whether \nthrough some form of doctrine of election, waiver, inconsistent  conduct , consent , free \nchoice  or otherwise , is highly fact specific .  It also requires proof of bad faith by the \nBank, and (despite Mr Alyoshin’s view to the contrary) reliance by the Defendants  on \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n279 \n what was said to be the conduct  having preclusive effect , neither of wh ich are alleged \nfor this purpose . \n1122.  Against this background, a simple reliance on what Mr Beketov said is in my view a \nwholly inadequate basis for explaining  precisely how what actually occurred in any of \nthe Ukrainian  proceedings gave rise to  the making of a  free choice by the Bank with \nthe legal effects for which the  Defendants  contend.   It does not seem to me that their \nmere pursuit can have had that effec t, a point which also applies  to the proceedings in \nrespect of which Ms Hryn gave her evidence .  The same can be said about the other \ncircumstances on which the Defendants relied.  In my judgment, and looking purely at \nthe factual question, unsatisfactorily divorced as it is from a pleading or proper analysis \nof the legal context, I think that what occurred  falls well short of the Bank making the \nchoice for which the Defendants appear to contend.   In short, the Bank was doing no \nmore than that which the courts in both  Chornomornaftogaz and Jyske Bank  \ncontemplated as being steps which were available to it in order maximise its recovery \nof the compensation to which it claims to be entitled.  \n1123.  It follows from these conclusions that, even if it had been appropriate to permit the \nDefendants to advance an unpleaded case on free choice at this stage, I am satisfied that \nthey have not proved that anything done by the Bank post -nationalisation  amounted to \na choice by the Bank to accept payments as discharging the Borrowers ’ liabilities to \nreturn the sums drawn down under the Relevant Loans , so as to preclude it from \ncontinuing to allege that it suffered the loss claimed in these proceedings .  I therefo re \nconclude that , in so far as it relies on what were called the Cash Repayments,  the \nDefendants’ Repayment Defence fails . \n \nThe Use of Funds  Defence  and the bigger fraud argument  \n1124.

The way that the Individual Defendants pleaded this defence was that the \nBank suffered no loss to the extent that funds advanced were transferred back to the \nBank.  \n1125.  The nature of the Use of Funds D efence and the Ukrainian law principles which apply \nto it are described in the experts ’ joint statement as follows:  \n“[Mr Beketov]  and [Mr Alyoshin]  disagree as to whether it makes any difference \nto the Bank’s claim if the funds received by a particular Borrower under a particular \nRelevant Loan were circulated back to the Bank to repay earlier loans:  \n[Mr Beketov’s] view is that, on an application of first principles (in particular the \nprinciples of full compensation for tortious loss, justice fairness and \nreasonableness, and consistent with the approach of the English courts in National \nBank Trust v . Yurov  [2020] EWHC 100) the Bank’s claim for tortious loss caused \nby the Relevant Loan should be unaffected by such repayment. It would be \nobviously wrong if a fraudster could steal from a bank to repay his own \nindebtedness and then claim the bank suffered n o loss as a result of his theft . \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n280 \n [Mr Alyoshin]  agrees that, in principle, the Bank’s loss caused by non -repayment \nof Relevant Loans would not be reduced in these circumstances. However, if \n(contrary to his view) a claim in tort arises in respect of a Relevant Loan which has \nbeen repaid then the use to  which the Relevant Loan has been put would also need \nto be taken into account in assessing the Bank’s loss.”  \n1126.  Mr Alyoshin also agree d that, as a matter of principle, the use to which stolen money is \nput does not reduce the Bank’s loss caused by the theft. He also accept ed that the \nanalysis in Yurov  is compelling and “supports Mr Beketov’s opinion (which I agree \nwith) that the use to which any Relevant Loans were put is not relevant when \ndetermining the amount of loss caused by the Relevant Loans” .  The essential point \nwhich was agreed by all experts was that the use of th e proceeds  of a misappropriation  \nby a wrongd oer is collateral to the wrongdoing and falls to be ignored as a matter of \nprinciple . \n1127.  As Mr Beketov and Mr Alyoshin have both accepted that the position described in \nYurov  at [1193] is both logical and reasonable and would be likely to be followed  in \nUkraine , it is worth citing the relevant passage in full : \n“As the Bank points out, the Shareholders’ argument involves the acceptance of \nthe proposition that a fraudster could steal from the Bank to repay his own \nindebtedness and then claim that the Bank has suffered no loss as a result of his \ntheft – such an arg ument is obviously (and demonstrably) wrong as can be \nillustrated by adapting the Shareholders’ own examples. In this regard, assume that \nthat the Bank has a non -performing loan to Borrower A of £1,000; and that A is an \nindividual who is entirely and irret rievably unable to pay, so that the Bank has  \nprovisioned the loan as to 100%. On the Shareholders’ premises, this represents an \nactual, incurred loss to the Bank of £1,000.  Now assume that A successfully \ndeceives the Bank into handing over to him £1,000 in cash, which A uses (as he \nplanned all along) to settle his original debt. When the Bank discovers the fraud \nand sues him, A’s defence (like the Shareholders’ in this case) is that the Bank has \nsuffered no loss because it had already lost £1,000; and its l oss remains the same \nafter the fraud. That cannot be right. The position would be no different if the \nfraudster was a different individual, B, who dishonestly obtained the money and \npassed it to A (whether as a "}

The position would be no different if the \nfraudster was a different individual, B, who dishonestly obtained the money and \npassed it to A (whether as a conspirator or a benevolent bystander) so tha t he could \nrepay his debt.”  \n1128.  To similar effect was what Toulson J said in Komercni at [171] , as cited by Bryan J in \nYurov  at [1195] : \n“Consider next the position if the fraudster decides to use the proceeds of his fraud \nto discharge a liability owed to the bank by a third party. I reject the argument that \nhe would be entitled to have that matter taken into account as a relevant benefit to  \nthe bank when calculating the loss resulting from his fraud. As before, his use of \nthe funds would be the result of his independent choice how to use the opportunity \ncreated by his fraud. Just as it would be wrong that a customer who could not repay \nhis overdraft should be able to pay off the overdraft with funds obtained from the \nbank by deceit, and then defeat the bank’s claim for deceit by saying that there had \nbeen no loss from his deceit (since the money obtained from it had been used to \nrepay a debt  that he could not have otherwise have paid), so also it would be wrong \nthat a similar result should be achieved by a customer and an accomplice - as would \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n281 \n be the case if the accomplice were able to obtain money from the bank by fraud, \nuse it to discharge the customer’s indebtedness and then defeat the bank’s action in \ndeceit by the plea that there had been no loss. ” \n1129.  However, Mr Kolomoisky ’s answer to this point was  qualified by  Mr Alyoshin ’s \nevidence to the effect that the position would be different if the court were to analyse \nthe case as one in which a claim in tort arise s in respect of a Relevant Loan which has \nbeen repai d (i.e., if the repayment of the Relevant Drawdown did not extinguish the \nBank’s loss  to the extent that Relevant Loans have themselves been repaid using the  \nproceeds of another unlawful loan ).  He said that in this situation , the court should \nconsider the net financial position of the Bank when assessing its loss.  He said that “i t \nwould be necessary to have regard to the use to which the proceeds of Relevant Loans \nhad been put, otherwise there would be sc ope for problems of double recovery and/or \nunjust enrichment to arise .” \n1130.  Connected to this point was the second of two consequences said to flow from an \nargument  made by counsel for Mr Bogolyubov that the Bank had been engaged over \nan unspecified  period  in loan recycling of which the Relevant Drawdowns formed part.   \nThe firs t consequence was said to be that there was no misappropriation  as a result of \nthe Relevant Drawdowns , because it can be seen that they went back to the Bank.  The \nsecond was  that the Bank sustained no compensa ble loss b ecause there was no overall \nincrease in  the Bank’s loan book  as a result of the Misappropriation.    These two \nconsequences are intimately interlinked and the evidence which was said to support \nthem was essentially the same . \n1131.  The position was summarised in Mr Bogolyubov’s  closing submissions where it was \nsubmitted  that R elevant Drawdowns  that are simply recycled to repay other loans have \na neutral effect on the Bank and can cause no loss.   A drawdown recycled to repay a \ndebt under the same loan has a neutral effect on the Bank , whether the drawdown is \nrecycled to repay the same loan , or a different loan of the same Borrower or a loan to a \ndifferent borrower .

A drawdown recycled to repay a \ndebt under the same loan has a neutral effect on the Bank , whether the drawdown is \nrecycled to repay the same loan , or a different loan of the same Borrower or a loan to a \ndifferent borrower .  Example s were given of situations in which,  on a funds flow basis , \na Relevant Drawdown by AEF was ‘round -tripped’, leading to the repayment of the \nsame amount on the same loan account by the end of the same day  and Relevant \nDrawdowns by Tseris  LLC (“Tseris”)  were recycled to repay a different loan of the \nsame Borrower were repaid by Tseris later the same month .  Reliance was also placed \non Mr Thompson’s acceptance in cross examination that , adopting a funds flow basis,  \nwhere a drawdown by one borrower was recycled to repay a loan of a different borrower \nthe recycling taken as  a whole had a neutral effect on the Bank:  \n“Q. So the net position of the Bank in terms of its ledgers remains the same. There’s \nsimply a change in the name of the borrow er. \nA. Yes”  \n1132.  In support of this proposition , Mr Bogolyubov relied on Mr Steadman’s evidence on \nthe issue of whether Relevant Drawdowns contributed to an increase in the size of the \nBank’s lending compared to the position prior to the period in which Relevant \nDrawdown s were being made.  He concluded t hat, ignoring the increase in the lending \nto the Borrowers, there was no increase in the value of lending to 466 of the Bank’s \ncustomers  during the active period of the Misappropriation .  He did so having  looked \nat the relative size of the Bank’s loan po rtfolio for the borrowers  he looked at the day \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n282 \n before the first  Relevant Drawdown was made  and on the day of the last  Relevant \nDrawdown.  He determined that there was an overall net increase in outstanding \nprincipal on the loan book of only US $72 million  and that the remainder of the increase \nrepresented accrued interest of US $618.3  million . \n1133.  It was submitted that this was consistent with the Relevant Drawdowns being a series \nof ledger entries and corroborate d the findings from the funds flow e xact matching and \nbridging loan methodologies, which showed  the Relevant Drawdowns being looped \naround in the Bank.   It was submitted that it followed that the increase in the size of the \nBank’s loan book during the period in which Relevant Drawdowns were  being made \nwas almost entirely driven by the accrual of interest, rather than an  increase in the level  \nof lending.   This was said to be inconsistent with the occurrence of a misappropriation \nduring this time period.  The data which he analysed was therefore said to be indicative \nof a loan recycling scheme with no loss caused to the Bank.  \n1134.  The Bank said  that there were a number of  problems with the exercise carried out by \nMr Steadman .  As a matter of pure mathematics based on the ledgers he had looked a t, \nhis analysis was not wrong, but the loan books he analysed were composed of entities \nwhich had been identified for another purpose .  As he explained he was not selective in \nhis choice of the relevant customers, but had understood they were selected by the \nparties and the court for disclosure, and that it was the “widest list of parties that are \nconnected in some way to the events”. They therefore comprised not just  Borrowers, \nbut also  the Intermediary Borrowers, the New  Borrowers, and a significant number of \nother entities identified as being customers  through whose accounts funds from the \nRelevant Drawdowns allegedly passed, as well as other customers whose loan balances \nwere repaid through the Transformation, Share Pledgors  and comp"}

They totall ed 446 in all .  Mr \nSteadman  said that t he data : \n“depicts the movement of Relevant Loan Drawdowns, the Intermediary Loans, the \nrepayment of the Relevant and Intermediary Loans, including the Asset Transfer \nand the Transformation, as well as the destination of the Relevant Loan \nDrawdowns”:  \n1135.  However,  the problem with his evidence was that taking th e selective approach that he \ndid does not he lp in establishing the Bank’s net loss ; it was ultimately based on an \narbitrary custo mer selection methodology which meant that it was both too narrow and \ntoo broad to support any meaningful conclusions on th is issue.  It is too narrow because \nit is far from clear that it covers a complete universe of all entities related to the \nIndividual Defendants ; there is no way of saying that it takes proper account of ledger \nentries in respect of all companies through which payments funded by the Relevant \nDrawdowns might have passed.  But it  is also too broad , because it does not even help \non the net loss on  the loan books of just the Borrowers and the loans associated with \nthem; if it had , Mr Steadman accep ted that it would have shown a substantial increase \non that net loss  during the period in which the Relevant Drawdowns were being made . \n1136.  Another way of looking at the problem is  that, considering only the net change in the \nportfolio does not tell you how Relevant D rawdowns were used or how Relevant L oans \nwere repaid .  Mr Steadman explained  that tracing the use of Relevant Drawdowns was \nnot the purpose of this particu lar exercise.   It was simply to  provide a different way of \nlooking at the question of whether there has been  a misappropriation .  As Mr Steadman \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n283 \n said in his 3rd report: “if the Bank’s loan portfolio had increased during this period by \nan amount equivalent in size of the R elevant Drawdowns , then it would follow that \nthese amounts may have been misappropriated, rather than used to repay other loans of \nthe Bank” .  Mr Bogolyubov submitted that t his also explains why looking at a wider \npopulation than just, say, Borrowers or Intermediary Borrowers was appropriate.  \n1137.  That may be the case, but the difficulty with this answer is that it does not address  the \nmore substantial aspect of the Bank’s case , which was  that some of the Relevant \nDrawdowns were in fact used to repay loans made by the Bank to or for the ultimate \nbenefit of the Individual Defe ndants’ operating companies.   Mr Bogolyubov ’s response \nto this  argument was that it was inconsistent with the Bank’s own m ethodology  and that \nthe Bank has not pleaded any case that it suffered loss on the basis that bad loans wer e \nused to repay good loans.   He also relied on the fact that the essence of the Bank’s case \nwas that the R elevant Drawdown s were stolen and ha d disclaimed any claim that its \nloss was caused by loan impairment.   For reasons I shall come on to, I do not think that \nthis answers the Bank’s point.  \n1138.  Also o n this theme , Mr Steadman carried out another analysis, which was said to show \nthat no sums from the Relevant Drawdowns were transferred by the Borrowers or \nIntermediary Borrowers to accounts outside the Bank.

It was therefore said on behalf \nof Mr Bogolyubov that that they did not leave what Mr Steadman had called “the \nBank’s eco -system” and were just ledger entries on the Bank’s balance sheet.   It was \nsaid that , for the Bank to have parted with any money, this would require a transfer to \na third -party bank or an extra ction in cash.  Mr Bogolyubov then relied on Mr \nSteadman ’s oral evidence that:  \n“[…] if one is looking for misappropriation, the first question should be to ask, \n\"What happened to the money?\". The quickest way to look at that is to say, \"Has \nany of the money left PrivatBank directly?\", and by \"directly\", from the borrowers \nand the int ermediary borrowers. ” \n1139.  It was also submitted t hat there was no analogy with the situation posited in Mr Hunter’s \noral opening submissions in which a thief  goes into a bank vault and com es out with \nthe mone y.  The  reality  of what occurred was  that a series of ledger entries  were made  \nrecording the notional creation and  discharge of debt obligations between the Bank and \nthe Borrowers. The only effect of this exercise was to change the identities of the \npersons owing money to the Bank ( i.e., from other borrowers to Borrowers to \nIntermediary Borrowers to New Borrowers) and the  instruments under which the debts  \nwere recorded as owing.   In short , the core of the submission was that t here was no \nmovement of value outside the Bank, no ‘appropriation’ and, so far as can be \nestablished, no net loss to the Bank during t he relevant period.   It was then positively \nsubmitted on behalf of Mr Bogolyubov that t he lack of any extraction of value from the \nBank, taken together with Mr Steadman’s analysis  of the Bank’s loan book, \nstrengthe ned the in evitable conclusion that what was really going on was loan \nrecycling.   On one level that is common ground . \n1140.  It was also said that this exercise went hand in hand with the assessment of whether the \nUnreturned Prepayments in fact left the Bank with the consequence  that both points at \nwhich the Bank has variously said money was “stolen” or “extracted” have been \nconsidered. As Mr Steadman explained:  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n284 \n “To my mind there's two important groups of customers to look at. One are the \nborrowers and the intermediary borrowers and the other one are the defendant \nsuppliers. Now, Mr Thompson has done the analysis of payments out of the \ndefendant suppliers and I hav e done the analysis of payments out of the borrowers. \nThe exercise involving all 466, however many it is, relevant customers it seemed \nto me is best covered by the tracing exercise which is following the actual funds. ” \n1141.  The evidence which was said to justify Mr Bogolyubov’s submission that there was no \nMisappropriation because nothing left the Bank’s eco -system  was contained in Mr \nSteadman’s report under the heading “Absence of indications of misappropriation”.  \nThe limitations on what this evidence would be able to prove was apparent at the outset \nbecause Mr Steadman recognised (and explained) that he was only giving evidence in \nrelation to what he called the “available information in relation to the alleged \nMisappropriat ion”.  The Bank called this an extraordinarily partial exercise, although I  \nthink that a more appropriate description of it is that it was incomplete and fell far short \nof proving this aspect of Mr Bogolyubov’s case.  \n1142.

Mr Steadman’s  work was accurate so far as it went but it was very limited .  It \ndemonstrated that the Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers made no more than de \nminimis  direct transfers to accounts outside the Bank, but for reasons which are wholly \nunclear (and inconsistently with the other ex ercise he carried out in relation to loan \nbook ledgers) it ignored the thousands of transfers made to accounts outside the Bank \nby the remaining c.400 customers from the cadre he had chosen.  As Mr Thompson \nexplained, th is left four categories of payment which Mr Steadman exclude d from his \nanalysis and which therefore rendered it incomplete.  They were: a) payments from \naccounts other than those of Borrowers and Intermediary Borrowers; b) payments to \naccounts which have ‘PrivatBank’ or the Ukrainian equivalent in their name; c) \npayments to trading companies the Bank alleges were owned or controlled by the \nIndividual Defendants; and d) a large number of additional payments made by Named \nCustomers to accounts outside the Ban k. \n1143.  The Bank submitted that only looking at direct payments out of the Borrowers’ and \nIntermediary Borrowers’ accounts was a pointless exercise given the way money \ncirculated within the Bank.   I think that there i s real substance in this submission, which \nwas well-illustrated by the following exchange during the course of Mr Thompson’s \ncross -examination by Ms Montgomery , which demonstrates that the exercise came \nnowhere near establishing that  Relevant Drawdowns did not fund or enable payments \nmade ou tside what he called the “Bank ’s eco -system” : \nQ.  The other thing that Mr Steadman says is that there are  no signs of payments \ngoing outside -- I think he likes  to call it the \"Bank ecosystem\" -- but outside the \nBank.  That's right, isn't it?  \nA.  Well, I write at length about this.  It depends how you  look at it.  I would say \nthat Mr Steadman has missed  quite a large number of payments that leave the \nbanking  system in a number of ways.  So he's looking at the 1500  and 1600 \naccounts.  He doesn't consider other PrivatBank  entities and he doesn't consider \nMFOs, which is  basically sort codes of external banks.  So I would say  that if you \nare going to go down that route, there are  actually a large number of additional \npayments outside  the Bank that h e hasn't considered.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n285 \n Q.  Right.  If you're not going to go down that route, if  you're just going to look at \nthe borrowers, as you want  to in relation to the loan book, you can confirm that  \nthere are no payments to accounts outside the Bank i n relation to the borrowers?  \nA.  Yes. ” \n1144.  On this point I accept Mr Thompson’s view of the limitations on the work done by Mr \nSteadman.  In my judgment, and despite the very detailed work carried out by him, it \ncomes nowhere near establishing on the facts that the Relevant Drawdowns were not \nused as part of the process of funding the repay ment of  loans made by the Bank to the \nIndividual Defendants’ operating companies  or indeed the making of other payments \nto them.   The evidence simply does not establish that no (or only de minimis ) payments \nfunded  by the Relevant Drawdowns went outside the Bank’s eco -system.   \n1145.

He said that , even if it is right \nto use the label loan recycling , it was important to recognise that that the very act of \nreplacing one shell company loan with another to avoid default by the first is itself a \nfraudulent and dishonest practise .  I agree with that observation , which is also reflected \nin the views of Bryan J when describing in Yurov  at [738] what in that case was called \n“the balance sheet management exercise ”, which was intended to and did mislead the \nrelevant regulator . \n1146.  Furthermore, Bryan J goes  on to explain at [770] why the loan recycling explanation \nmay not  help Mr Bogolyubov on the issue of loss either.  He said the following, the \nessential elements of which are equally applicable to the present case:  \n“The second example … is the Bank providing funds to companies in the off -\nbalance sheet structure by making a loan to company X which has fallen due for \nrepayment and the Bank lends money to company Y, which transfers the money to \ncompany X, which then repays its loan. It is s aid that the Bank has suffered no \nfinancial loss as the money will have returned to the Bank and the debtor has simply \nbeen changed from one off -balance sheet company to another. Quite apart from the  \nShareholders having been unable to prove all the links within the chain (the reality \nis far more complicated than this simplistic example), this example ignores all the \nother reasons that have already been addressed as to why “balance sheet \nmanagement” is inappropriate, why each of the loan s should not have been made \nand why it was not in the interests of the Bank to do so, the fact that more and more \n(larger loans) are needed to service interest and principal (in each case to companies \nwhere lending was neither justifiable nor justified), a nd the fact that at some point \n(as occurred) the music stops and the Bank faces a mass of defaulted loans. … I am \nsatisfied that this is another reason why “balance sheet management” is not \nreasonable, or in the best interests of the Bank, and is in fact not in good faith and \ndishonest, as it not only exposes the Bank to the risk of financial loss, but actually \nresults in financial loss to the Bank. ” \n1147.  Mr Hunter's second submiss ion was that it is not right to use the label loan recycling, \nat least for the purported loans used in the Misappropriation , including those which \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n286 \n were said to document the entitlement of Borrowers to make  the Relevant Drawdowns .  \nHe characterised it more as “theft recycling ” on the basis that misappropriated money \n(i.e., some of the Relevant Drawdowns ) were used to pay back  other misappropriated \nmoney in circumstances in which  the Relevant Loans themselves were void , and \ntherefore did not give rise to the normal relationship of lender and borrower.  He also \npointed out that it was unclear whether Mr Bogolyubov’s  case was that this form of \nrecycling wa s going on before the making of the Relevant Loans, or whether  it was a \nform of recycling that could more accurately be called loan recycling similar to that \nwhich was described in Yurov , on the grounds that the loans themselves were not void . \n1148.

Thirdly, Mr. Hunter made what he described as the most fundamental of his three \npoints , which was that it is no answer for a wrongdoer to say  that he should have been \nsued on a bigger fraud of which the particular wrongs relied on are only part, unless \nthat wrongdoer takes on the task both of proving the bigger fraud and  of demonstrating \nthat the loss from the bigger fraud  is lower than that  which flows from the specific \nwrongs on which he has been sued .  Put another way, it is necessary for the wrongdoer \nin that context to demonstrate that the election which t he victim of the fraud is entitled \nto make  to choose the act of wrongdoing on which it sues, is likely to have led to an \nover-recovery . \n1149.  In my judgment, this last submissi on is an accurate statement  of the approach which \nwould be taken by an English court.   It is well illustrated  by Re JD Group Ltd, Bhatia \nv. Purkiss  [2023] EWHC 775 (Ch) , an appeal from an ICC judge in  a  case brought by  \nthe liquidator of a company in the mobile phone business against its director  for losses \nsustained by the company as a result of a missing trader fraud .  The claim focused on a \nsingle VAT quarter and 12 fraudulent transactions , even though the background \nincluded 530 transactions over a longer period extending both sides of the chosen \nquarter .  The grounds of appeal included one on quantum  to the effect that  the judge \nshould have assessed damages on the basis of the difference between the actual position \nof the company and the position it would have been i n if it had decided not to e nter into \nthe mobile phone business at all .  The argument was based on what was said to be the \njudge’s finding that the whole of the business was illegitimate.  \n1150.  Sir Anthony Mann  dismissed the appeal on two bases.  The first was th at he was not \nsatisfied that the ICC judge had really  made the finding of illegitimacy on which the \nsubmission was made  and the second, which is the one which matters for present \npurposes, was that the point failed as a matter of principle in any event.  He explained \nthe position at [67] of his judgment as follows:  \n“For the purposes of the misfeasance claim each transaction which was entered into \nwhich was done as part of a fraudulent scheme was a separate breach of duty. They \nare each capable of supporting a separate damages claim, and can be aggregated, \nas here, to  see what damages have accrued in a particular period. Unless the \ndefendant somehow seeks to say that it is artificial to do that because the \ntransactions were part of a much bigger fraud which has yielded some overall \nprofit, so loss was not caused by the se individual transactions (an argument which \nwould be very difficult to run in any event), then it is appropriate to take the \nfraudulent and wrongful transactions in this case and to see what damages flow \nfrom them. Of course,  the defendant in this case is not alleging some wider fraud \nwhich protects him from the consequences of the narrower one, so the point does \nnot arise.”  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n287 \n 1151.  I agree with this statement of principle and am satisfied that Ukrainian law is to the \nsame effect.

I agree with this statement of principle and am satisfied that Ukrainian law is to the \nsame effect.   As Mr Beketov explained , where there are two separate tortious acts, such \nas the making of two separate purported loans, t here is no rule of Ukrainian law that \nwould oblige the victim to sue the wrongdoer in relation to one instance of \nmisappropriation rather than the other .  The correct approach is that t he victim c an \nchoose which instance of misappropriation to sue upon, but would not be permitted to \ndouble recover .  This is consistent with Mr Beketov’s view that , under Ukrainian law, \nwhere tortfeasors jointly cause harm to a victim, he may elect to sue either of them \nseparately or both of them for the full amount , provided that they do not ultimately \ndouble recover .  He says that this i s clear from Article 543 of the Civil Code and I a gree \nwith the opinion he has expressed.  \n1152.  This is entirely consistent with English law’s approach to election as between different \ncauses of action arising out of the same events , which itself underpins the principle \nexpressed in  Sir Anthony Mann’s decision in the JD Group  case.  Th us, wher e goods \nare misappropriated from a victim and pass through the hands of multiple parties, each \nof the intervening recipients of the goods is liable in conversion for the value of the \ngoods (i.e. the loss suffered by the victim) even if such a person has not  cause d any \nadditional loss over and above that caused by the original thief ( Kuwait Airways v . Iraqi \nAirways (No 4 & 5)  [2002] 2 AC 883 at [81] -[82])  and, as Bryan J explained in \nLakatamia  at [938], where there are successive torts:  \n“So far as causation is concerned, as a general principle of tort law, it is no answer \nfor the defendant to say that, but for his wrongdoing which has in fact resulted in \nloss, the same loss would have been suffered because of some other tort or legal \nwrong was or would have been committed at a later point in time whether by the \ndefendant or someone else .  The princi ple in summarised in McGregor on \nDamages, 21st ed., at paragraph 8 -007 as follows:  \n“the “but for” test is usually applied by asking whether but for the \nwrongdoing the loss would have been lawfully  suffered. This qualification \nensures that a victim is not made worse off by further wrongdoing”  (original \nemphasis)”  \n1153.  The Bank then submitted that , even if it were true that the Relevant Drawdowns were \nall part of a much larger fraud, involving  fraudulent extractions from the Bank all \ncommitted  in breach of duty  and all causing the Bank harm, it is entitled to take only \nthe R elevant Drawdowns and sue for full compensation for  the harm they caused .  I \nagree with that submission.  I also agree  with the Bank’s further submission that , if the \nDefendants wish to advance the argument  that the election to sue on those breaches of  \nduty is artificial  as it would lead to over recovery on the basis that it was part of some \nwider fraud  and looking at matters as a whole there  is a lesser loss or profit, that is a \nmatter which the Defendants themselves must prove .  In JD Group , Sir Anthony Mann \nrightly described that as a very difficult argument, because it would require the \nDefendants to demonstrate with proper particularity what the bigger fraud was from \nstart to finish , and show that the loss from that bigger fraud was less than the part on \nwhich that the victim has elected to sue . \n1154.  It is also an answer to Mr Steadman’s suggestion that  the court should consider the net \nfinancial position of the Bank when assessing its loss , and for that reason should  have \nregard to the use to which the proceeds of Relevant Loans had been put ; his concern \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commerci"}

For the reasons I have already explained, any question of double \nrecovery is quite separate from the question of the Bank ’s entitlement to elect to sue for \ncompensation for some but not all of the harm that it might have sustained by the \nDefendants’ unlawful conduct.  If the Defendants had wished  to allege that the \ncompensation should be limited to some form of net loss, or reduced because some \nother t ort or legal wrong was or would have been committed at a later point in time \nwhether by the defendant or someone else , and no such case of a bigger or more \nextensive fraud is pleaded,  it will run into the difficulties of principle explained and \napplied by Bryan J in the Lakatamia .  \n1155.  The evidential difficulties which any such defence would face is readily apparent from \nthe fact that the Bank did, in any event, collapse with a huge accounting loss , which \nwas far bigger than the compensation for which the Bank sues  in the present case . It \nfollows, so the Bank submitted and I agree , that the Use of Funds Defence does not \nwork as a matter of principle b ecause it requires  the Defendant to plead and prove that \nthe Relevant Drawdowns on which the Bank has elected to sue a re all part of a bigger \nfraud  which caused a total loss which was lower than the loss for which compensation \nis claimed as a result of their unlawful acts .  Not only was this not pleaded, but the \nevidence on which Mr Bogolyubov sought to rely in the form of Mr Steadman’s report \nwas both selective and limited in its reach.  Indeed, it does not really even  purport to \nsupport th e width of the case required to be p roved in order to get such a n argument off \nthe ground.  \n1156.  In my judgment, this argument is wrong as a matter of Ukrainian law , which can be \nsummarised by reference to two principles which were agreed by the experts:  \ni) The unlawful taking of the Bank’s money pursuant to  a Relevant Drawdown \nunder a void Relevant Loan is harm in the form of the  taking of the Bank’s \nproperty , which occur red when the Relevant Drawdowns w ere made .  That is \nproperly to be characterised as a misappropriation under the law of Ukraine \nbecause  an unlawful act  has caused  the Bank’s property to be taken by another \n(the Borrower) . \nii) The use of the funds  by a wrongdoer (the Borrower ) to repay other liabilities , if \nand to the extent that this occurred,  cannot as a matter of Ukrainian law have \nreduced the prim a facie loss for which the Bank is entitled to compensation \nunder Article 1166 .  To the extent that Mr Alyoshin ’s agreement  was qualified \non the basis that  what was said in Yurov  at [1193] (see paragraph  1127  above ) \ndoes not represent  the law of Ukraine where  the repayment of the  Relevant \nLoans have themselves been repaid using the proceeds of another unlawful loan , \nI have already explained why that is not an answer , anyway on the facts of this \ncase. \n1157.  The Bank also submitted  that one of the problems with the analysis put forward on \nbehalf of Mr Bogolyubov  was that it proceeded  on the erroneous basis that Relevant \nDrawdowns were just ledger entries , involving nothing more tha n a simple change in \nthe name of the borrower , and that for that reason there was no the ft from the Bank  and \nnothing has been appropriated.

The way the point was put by Ms Montgomery was that \nthe Relevant Drawdowns did not amount to  a deprivation of the Bank's property giving \nrise to harm under Article 1166 .  They were said just to be  ledger entries whi ch created \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n289 \n new money in the hands of the Borrowers  but without depriving the Bank of any of its \nmoney .  This was essentially the same point as Mr Bogolyubov’s answer to the thief -\nin-a-bank -vault analogy to which I have already referred . \n1158.  I agree that this argument cannot be sustained in the light of the agreed expert evidence .  \nWhile what occurred was undoubtedly the making of a series of ledger entries , the \nexperts agreed that the movement of money (recorded by ledger entries ) from the Bank \nto the bank account of a customer is a deprivation of the Bank’s funds . This was the \nagreed position because, as the experts said in their joint statement, money, whether in \nthe form of cash or in a bank account, is a form of property and in appropriate \ncircumstances (and provided that all other elements are present) loss of money is \nactionable under the Ukrainian law of tort.  They confirmed that “it makes no difference \nto the Bank's claim that at all times the monies involved in the Misappropriation \nremained in accounts held at the Bank”.  \n1159.  Mr Beketov’s crisp explanation of the position , with which I agree , was that “an \nelectronic transfer of funds from one person to another is thus capable of constituting \nharm to the transferor.”   He then went on to explain , by reference to Article 1066 of the \nCivil Code , that the funds so transferred became  the funds of the customer  with the \nconsequence that “The Bank has no right to determine or control use of funds of the \nclient and to establish  other than prescribed by the agreement or the law, limitation s of \nits [client’s] right to use  funds in its own discretion” .  This is also the case where a \nbank’s money has been transferred to a customer’s account pursuant to a void \ntransaction (such as a fraudulent loan agreement). He said that, u nless the customer  \nagrees that it may do so, the bank cannot at its discretion transfer those funds out of that \ncustomer’s account, without  first obtain a court judgment entitling it to do so . \n1160.  It was also suggested on behalf of Mr Bogolyubov that  there was therefore no loss .  In \nmy view this too is a submission which does not work as a matter of Ukrainian law .  \nWhat matters for the Bank’s claim is the amount of compensation required to effect \nrestitutio in integrum  for the harm caused by the unlawful conduct in the form of the \nRelevant Drawdowns .  Even if the re was no accounting loss b ecause, in accounting \nterms, the position is what might be characterised as flat in the sense  that the Bank has \nlost by a misappropriation , but has then gained through the  repayment of an impaired \ndebt is irrelevant .  This is because,  the use of funds principle means tha t the use to \nwhich misappropriated money is put  is ignored in assessing the loss caused to the Bank \nby the breach of duty or other unlawful act committed in effecting the misappropriation \nin the first place . \n \nThe Repayment Defence: Asset Transfer s \n1161.

The Asset Transfers were  also advanced by the Defendants as part  of the Repayment \nDefence , although the analysis was slightly different  from the way in which the case \nwas put in relation to the making of the Intermediary Loans and the New Loans .  The \nDefendants contended that , between March 2016 and September 2016, a credit value \nattributable to each of the Transferred Assets was applied in the Bank’s books to reduce \nthe balances outstanding on the Relevant Loans.   I have summarise d what happened \nduring that period , and how it related to the Bank’s Restructuring Plan , together with \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n290 \n the actual mechanics of the Asset Transfers in those sections of the judgment which \nstart at paragraphs 485 and 528 above.  \n1162.  Against that background, t he Defendants  also submitte d that the Bank had always \naccepted that the amount outstanding under the Relevant Loans was reduced or \ndischarged to the extent of the applied credit value of the Transferred Assets.   This last \nsubmiss ion was wrong.  As with the Cash Repayments, it was always  the Bank ’s \npleaded case that the Asset Transfers only reduced the loss claimed against the \nDefendants arising out of their unlawful conduct in procuring the Relevant Drawdowns , \nand only reduced the balances on the Relevant Loans , to the extent of the true value of \nthe Transferred Assets .  It was always its case that the applied credit value was to be \nignored, and that for the purposes of assessing both the amount outstanding under the \nRelevant Loans and the extent of the loss sustained as a result of the unlawful conduct, \nUkrainia n law only required a reduction to the extent of the true value of the Transferred \nAssets . \n1163.  Thus , it appears from paragraph 28K of  the Bank ’s Reply that  its case is that the \npurported reduction of the outstanding balances under the Relevant  Drawdowns  were \nonly “purported” and , to the extent that Transferred Assets were improperly overvalued , \ntheir receipt by the Bank  had no effect either on the amount outstanding under the \nRelevant Loan s or on the loss which the Bank sustained as a result of the unlawful \nconduct which procured a Relevant Drawdown.   To this extent , the Bank’s case in \nanswer to the Repayme nt Defence as i t applies to  the Asset Transfers is the same as the \nRepay ment Defence as it applies to the Cash Repaym ents. \n1164.  However , the Bank does accept that, according to its own transactional data, between \nMarch 2016 and September 2016, the Original 2016 Values attributed to each of the \nTransferred Assets was applied to reduce the balances outstanding on Relevant Loans \n(to the extent of US$538 mil lion and UAH 1.296 billion) and Intermediary Loans which \nwere not also Relevant Loans (to the extent of US$123 million and UAH 1.276 billion).  \nIts case is  that it is only required to reduce the loss for which it claims in these \nproceedings by the true val ue of a Transferred Asset, and only to the extent that the true \nvalue is properly attributable to the repayment of a Relevant Drawdown.  \n1165.  The Individual Defendants dispute  this approach.  It was Mr Kolomoisky’s case that \nthe Bank is required to give full credit for the value of each Transferred Asset, either as \nstated in the mortgage agreement under which it was transferred or as stated in its \naccounts with each Relevant Bo rrower or Intermediary Borrower , if different.

He \ndenied that the Bank was entitled under Ukrainian law to give credit by reference to \nany smaller sum which it may now regard as the true value of a Transferred Asset.  The \nway the point was put in argument by Mr Howard was that , if the assets were \novervalued and that caused the Bank to give too much credit to the Borrowers, then the \nBank would have a claim in tort against whoever was responsible , but that would be a \ndifferent claim in respect of a different wrongful act and a different loss . \n1166.  It was also submitted on his behalf that this was the case even if the mortgage was void \nbecause, in those circumstances, the Bank was under a duty to give restitution of the \nassets transferred under what was an invalid transaction pursuant to Article 216 (as to \nwhich see above).  Not having done so, it was not now open to the Bank to assert the \ninvalidity of the Asset Transfers or the terms on which they were made.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n291 \n 1167.  In his evidence, Mr Beketov accepted that , as a matter of Ukrainian law, in the case of \na valid loan, once a mortgagee enforces the mortgage and credits the borrower’s account \nwith the value of the asset as set out in the mortgage document, the loan is discharged \n(anyway pro tanto ) by virtue of the bank having exercised its rights as mortgagee.  He \nalso accepted that any liability of a third party in tort for procuring that loan will be \nextinguished because (and to the extent that) the loss caused by his to rtious conduct is \ncoextensive with the liability of the borrower.  \n1168.  It was also essentially common ground that the position under Ukrainian law is different \nwhere the loan is void.  It was agreed between the Ukrainian law experts that, in that \nsituation, a mortgage agreement securing, or rather purporting to secure, the in valid \nloan is also invalid and any terms, including valuations within it, are not binding on the \nparties.  This view was justified by Article 548(2) of the Civil Code.  Mr Beketov’s \nview was that this also applied to  any inflated values recorded in the Ban k’s \ntransactional data , both because the agreement, being void, is of no effect, and because \nany reduction to the Bank’s loss by such inflated value would result in the Bank not \nbeing fully compensated for its loss.  \n1169.  Anyway by the conclusion of the trial, it was not suggested by the Defendants that, \nwhere the loan was invalid, the mortgagee  was bound by the valuations in the mortgage \nagreements.   However, t he issue which did not appear to be  agreed between the experts \nwas the consequence of the Bank’s decision to credit the Borrowers with the amounts \nthat it did.  In this context the Bank’s failure to give restitution was said by the \nDefendants to prevent the Bank from denying that the amount s recorded in the Bank’s \nbooks continued to bind the Bank to those credit values for the purposes of assessing \nthe amount of the Bank’s claim for compensation for the losses it says that it suffered \nfrom the Individual Defendants’ unlawful acts.  \n1170.  As to this, Mr Beketov accepted that, where the Relevant Loan and any mortgage \ngranted as security for it are void, the starting point is that the parties (and in the current \ncontext the party which matters is the Bank) are prima facie  under an obligation to give \nrestitution of any property transferred under it.

As to this, Mr Beketov accepted that, where the Relevant Loan and any mortgage \ngranted as security for it are void, the starting point is that the parties (and in the current \ncontext the party which matters is the Bank) are prima facie  under an obligation to give \nrestitution of any property transferred under it.  It is not in issue that the Bank has not \ntaken any steps to give restitution of the Transferred Assets, but Mr Beketov gave \nevidence that this did not have the consequence for which the Defendants contended.  \nHe said that, if the Individual Defendants were acting in bad faith or seeking to cause \nharm to the transferee by reason of the transaction of transfer, the restitution to which \nthey would otherwise be entitled would be refused as an abuse of r ight contrary to \nArticle 13(2) and (3)  (a prov ision which I have considered earlier in this judgment) . \n1171.  In Mr Beketov’s opinion, a sufficient abuse would be established if the Bank were to \nprove that the Relevant Loans and Intermediary Loans were purportedly secured by \npledges of no (or insufficient and/or overstated) value, and that the pledgors acted in \nbad faith or did so in order to give a false impression that valuable security had been \nprovided in order to facilitate the Misappropriation or to conceal the harm caused to the \nBank by the Misappropriation.  The Bank accepted that, for this argument to prev ail, it \ncould not both deny restitution and retain the benefit of the relevant Transferred Asset.  \nIt must therefore credit those assets at their true value in partial discharge of both the \nBorrowers’ liability under the Relevant Loans and the Defendants’ liability as \ntortfeasors for procuring those loans.   I do not think that Mr Alyoshin had a credible \nanswer to this evidence.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n292 \n 1172.  Mr Beketov also agreed that , as a matter of Ukrainian law , it is still open to a mortgagee \nto choose to accept a mortgaged asset in discharge of the borrower’s liability secured \nby the mortgage, even where the mortgage and the loan agreement in relation to which \nthe mortgage was granted are both void.  Put anothe r way, he accepted that, if the \nmortgagee bank chooses to accept an asset which had been valued in the mortgage , and \ncredits the agreed value of that asset to the borrower’s account, this will have the effect \nof discharging the borrower’s liability to make restitution, anyway to the extent of the \nvalue attributed to that asset in the mortgage document.  \n1173.  Thus, where a bank has made a choice to take that course, and credits the account of \nthe borrower to which a void loan has been made with the value of the asset charged by \nthe void mortgage, the liability of the relevant borrower will be discharged pro tan to \nand the liability of the third party tortfeasor who procured the arrangement of the \nrelevant loan and any loss will have been eliminated.   The evidence did not address the \nquestion of how that choice might be made , but as I understood it, the argument w as \nsimply that the entry of the c redit value  of a Transferred Asset in the books of the Bank \nby way of reduction in the outstanding balance on the Borrowers ’ loans was sufficient \nfor this purpose.  \n1174.  That seem to me to be an ambitious submission .  There was no assistance from the \nexperts on the way it needed to put as a  matter of Ukrainian  law and, even looked at \nthrough English eyes, the circumstances would have to be such that the Bank thereby \ncommitted to not reversing the entry in due course  if and when it becam e apparent that \nthe asset was overvalued .  That will all depend on the surrounding circumstances .

In \nthis case, I  have real difficulty in seeing how, on the facts, there is any basis for all eging \nan irrevocable commitment to accept the credit value (and only the credit value ) figure \nin discharge of all or any part of the amount outstanding from the Borrower.  There was \nno real explanation  as to why an irrevocable election of that sort might apply , whether \nas against the Borrower or as against the De fendants as tortfeasors.  I n any event , the \npoint  is inconsistent with the fact that , from the start of the process of making the Asset \nTransfers, the NBU had always made clear that the values the Bank was seeking to \nattribute to the Transferred Assets seemed to them to be grossly ov erinflated : see the \ndescription of what occurred  in paragraphs  485 to 532 above  and my conclu sion that  \nthe evidence does not support a conclusion that what are described as “NBU verified \nvalues” were in fact accepted by the NBU as correct for capital adequacy purposes . \n1175.  In their closing submissions , counsel for Mr Kolomoisky  also submitted that, if there \nwere to be any scope (which t hey said t here is not) for the Bank to ignore the credits it \ngave to the Borrowers in respect of the Transferred Assets so as to claim damages from \nthe Individual Defendants  on the basis that the Borrowers ’ liabilities somehow \nremained outstanding, this would be a clear case for the application of the  principle  of \nvenire contra factum proprium .  I have already considered this doctrine in paragraph s \n1119  to 1121  above,  from which it can be seen that there are a number of requirements \nfor its application.  \n1176.  But, quite apart from  the fact that the Defendants did not formulate a case of unfairness \nor bad faith  on the part of the Bank , the point which requires emphasis in this particular \ncontext is one of reliance .  I think that Mr Beketov’s evidence that reasonable reliance \nto the detriment of the Defendants is required for the venire contra factum proprium  to \napply (supported as it is by  the resolution of the Supreme Court in case No. 390/34/17  \nPerson 2 v . Satori -S LLC ) is more compelling than Mr Alyoshin’s opinion that it is not.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n293 \n 1177.  It was then said in Mr Kolomoisky’s  closing submissions that : \n“… even if there is a need for det rimental reliance  it is clearly satisfied in this case \nto the extent that [Mr Kolomoisky] allowed assets to be transferred to the Bank on \nthe understanding that the Relevant Loans would be repaid to the extent of the \nvaluations in the Bank’s books, at any rate insofar as [Mr Kolomoisky] did not \ndishonestly cause the assets to be overvalued. ” \n1178.  In the light of what occurred, I do not accept that it would have been reasonable for the \nIndividual Defendants to rely on any such credit in the outstanding balance on the \nBorrower s’ account  in that manner .  In the absence of evidence to the contrary,  as to \nwhich there is none,  it is not possible to make any finding that  Mr Kolomoisky (or \nindeed  the other Defendants ) had the understanding alleged, or  relied to their detriment \nin the manner suggested.  Even if there were to be such evidence, it is far from clear \nthat, in light of the Individual Defendants’ knowledge that they were not fully \ncompl ying with the NBU’s requirements for recapitalising the Bank  while the Asset \nTransfers were taking place , it would have been reasonable for them to rely on the credit \nvalue applications in the manner alleged .

In my view, the way that the process \nproceeded is inconsistent with any suggestion that  the offer of further security as part \nof the capitalisation process had anything to do wi th the  suggested understanding . \n1179.  It follows from this, that I have concluded that the loss for which the Individual \nDefendants are liable is only capable of being reduced or discharged to the extent of the \ntrue value of the Transferred Assets.  It was only to that extent that the claims m ade \nagainst the Borrowers in respect of the Relevant Drawdowns were reduced or \nextinguished.  \n1180.  I also consider that this argument fails for another reason.  It was  Mr Beketov’s evidence  \nthat the defence would not be available if the Individual Defendants w ere not \nthemselves acting in good faith by being a party to some form of fraudulent \noverinflation of the security in which  the overstatements were made  to give a false \nimpression that valuable security had been provided in order to facilitate the \nMisappropriation or to conceal the harm caused to the Bank by the Misappropriation . \n1181.  This was not seriously challenged by the Defendants, although Mr Howard said that , as \na matter of evidence,  that could only be the case in relation to the particular assets where \nsignificant overinflation  had occurred because otherwise , an inference as to bad faith \ncould not properly be drawn.  I do not agree with this last submission.  In my view , \ninferences of dishonesty, bad faith and overinflation may well be appropriate when \nlooking at the Asset Transfers as a whole, even though some parts of the over-inflation  \nwere significantly more egregious  than others . In my judgment, that is the situation in \nthe present case . \n1182.  Before considering the expert valuation evidence on the Transferred Assets , there are \ntwo preliminary points of substance which go to the bad faith of the Individual \nDefendants in the context of the Asset Transfers.  The first is the evidence which deals \nwith the ownership of the Transferred Assets.   If established it would be important \ncorroboration of the Bank’s case that the Individual Defendants were themselves \ninvolved in the Asset Transfers .  This would both further undermine the Repayment \nDefence for  the reasons I have just considered .  As will appear I have reached the \nconclusion that neither of them have been truthful or straightforward in relation to this \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n294 \n aspect of the case , a conclusion which is also capable of further evidencing the \nIndividual Defendants’ likely role in the Misappropriation.   The second relates to the \nvaluation  of the Share Pledges , which was an issue in the proceedings but no longer is.  \nHowever , what occurred in that context has affect ed my assessment of the likelihood \nof a deliberate manipulation of the values of the Transferred Assets and to that extent \nis relevant to an overall assessment of the Defendants ’ approach to the implementat ion \nand subsequent attempts t o evade the consequences of the Misappropriation.  \n \nThe ownership of the Transferred Assets  \n1183.  It was at the heart of the Bank’s case that  all of the Transferred Assets belonged to one \nor other of the Individual Defendants or were assets in which one or both of them had \na significant direct o r indirect ownership interest .

It was at the heart of the Bank’s case that  all of the Transferred Assets belonged to one \nor other of the Individual Defendants or were assets in which one or both of them had \na significant direct o r indirect ownership interest .  I cannot rule out the possibility  that \nneither of the Individual Defendants had any interest  in a small number of the \nTransferred Assets , but the evidence points to that being improbable .  There are a \nnumber of reasons why, applying  the balance of probabilities,  I am satisfied that the \nBank has est ablished that, whatever the identity of the Asset Transferor, all of the \nTransferred Assets were in the ultimate beneficial ownership of both of them, and in \nlarge part their ultimat e beneficial ownership was held in equal shares . \n1184.  The first reason is the extent of the Transferred Assets in respect of  which the Individual \nDefendants have  admitted a n interes t.  They made these admissions in an annex to Mr \nKolomoisky’s  response dated  30 July 2021 to a request for further information served \nby the Bank .  On 22 June 2022, Mr Bogolyubov  asserted through his solicitors that he \nhad not been able to verify the information in Mr Kolomoisky’s response in order to \nprovide confirmation that the extent of his beneficial ownership of the Transferred \nAssets was in fact accurately recorded, but he  accepted  that they were  accurate for the \npurposes  of these proceedings . \n1185.  Thus six of the seven items of real esta te (Hotel Mir, Hotel Zirka , the Training Centre , \nthe Pidgorodnye Airfield  situated a t 2 Druzhby Street, Sloboshan sky Settlement, \nDnipropetrovsk Oblast (the “Airfield”) , an office building at Muze inyi Lane , Kyiv (the \n“Kyiv Office”)  and the Stadium) are admitted to have been wholly beneficially owned \nby the Individual Defendants  immediately prior to the transfer.  They were owned by \nthem in the prop ortions 50/50 apart from the Stadium , which was owned as to 54.5% \nto Mr Kolomoisky and as to 45.5% by Mr Bogolyubov .  The only real estate asset  which \nis not admitted to have been wholly  beneficially  owned by the Individual Defendants \nis the Okeanmash office building in Dnipro which is said to have been wholly owned \nby Petro Klymenko.  \n1186.  The Defendants deny that t he nine aircraft , two manufactured by Airbus, four by Boeing \nand three by Embraer, were  owned by the Individual Defendants  at the time of the Asset \nTransfer s.  It is their pleaded case that they were  owned at the time of the transfer  by \nViktor Shkindel .  However , it is admitted that the majority of the petrol stations and \nOSFs were owned at the time of tra nsfer by companies  in which the Individual \nDefendants  beneficially owned a majority stake .  Of the 246 petrol stations, the \nIndividual Defendants had an admitted majority stake in 180 of them ; there were 28 in \nwhich they deny having  had any interest.   Of the  74 OSFs , the Individual Defendants \nhad an admitted majority stake in 44 of them ; there were 26 in which they deny having \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n295 \n had any interest.   Apart from some de minimis  outliers  and interests held by  Igor and \nGregoriy Surkis who are said to own more than a de minimis  interest in a few of the \npetrol station and OSF owning companies, two individuals and their families (Iurii \nKiperman , and Igor Palytsia ) are said to be the owners of almost all of the remaining \ninterest s. \n1187.  The second  reason is that it remained the case that the Individual Defendants continue d \nto hold more than 90% of the Bank’s shares, and it was those interests which would \nhave been most adversely affected by non-compliance with the  recapitalisation \nrequirements of the Restructuring Plan insisted on by the NBU.

In other words , the \nIndividual Defendants had substantially  the greatest economic interest in recapitalising \nthe Bank in accordance with the NBU’s requirements.  \n1188.  The third reason is linked to t he second.   There is no obvious reason, and none is \nsuggested in any evidence adduced by the Individual Defendants , as to why any third \nparty would  consent to their assets being used as part of the Asset Transfers , in any \nevent  without being compensated for doing so .  As to compensation, t here is no \nevidence  that any of the third parties said by the Individual Defendants to have had \ninterests in the Transferred Asset s acquired any rights against the Bank or the Individual \nDefe ndants in exchange for the contributions  to the Bank’s capital that they would have \nmade if the y had been the true owners of the assets concerned.  \n1189.  The fourth reason  is that, at a General Meeting held on 28 August 2016, the Bank’s \n2015 financial statements were approved  by the Bank’s shareholders  including  the \nIndividual Defendants .  The agenda for the General M eeting , including  items for the \napproval of the financial statements, was set at a meeting of the Supervisory Board held \non 10 August 2016 at which both of the Individual Defendants were recorded as taking \npart.  Those financial statements made clear in the following passage that  the \nTransferred Assets emanated from both of the Individual Defendants , being described \nas “their own assets” : \n“As a response to the NBU’s requirement on improvement of credit quality of the \nBank's assets, the Bank repossessed collateral to settle certain outstanding loans \nand advances to customers. In addition, the Bank's major shareholders, aiming to \nsupport the B ank's compliance with the regulatory requirements, contributed their \nown assets in the form of repossessed collateral to partially or fully settle loans \nissued to related and third parties. Negotiations on collateral repossession with the \nBank's borrowers  and the major shareholders commenced in 2015 and were \ngenerally completed by the end of June 2016, when the Bank became the owner of \nthe respective assets and recognised them at the fair value of approximately UAH \n31,845 million in its balance sheet as re possessed collateral. ” \n1190.  The fifth reason is that the whole  of the contemporaneous documentation is consistent \nwith the fact that Mr Kolomoisky  was representing to the NBU that the contributions \nbeing made to the Bank’s capital from the Asset Transfer s came from him and Mr \nBogolyubov  as the Bank’s existing shareholders .  The Individual Defendants must have \nknown that the NBU would have been interested in the involvement of any third party \nultimate beneficial owners of assets to be tra nsferred .

As to  the nine  aircraft , the evidence discloses an elaborate series of transactions \ninvolving a number of separate entities  all of which , both as original transferors  to the \nBank and as ultimate transferees from the Bank , are likely to have been controlled by \nthe Individual Defendants .  The next paragraphs of this judgment explain my findings \nas to what occurred.  \n1193.  Each  of the  nine aircraft  was owned until the end of  August  2016 by one of three \nPortuguese companies, Teide Servicos de Consultoria LDA (“Teide”) , Goiania \nComercio e Servicos Internacionais LDA (“ Goi ania”) or Pennylane Comercio  \nInternacional LDA (“Pennylane”) .  It is not in issue that at various times both before \nand after the time of the Asset Transfers the ultimate beneficial ownership of each of \nthese companies was held by the Individual Defendants in equal shares.   Thus, the \nshares in each of the companies were pledged to the Bank pursuant to the Share Pledges \nand in that context the Individual Defendants  both admitted that , throughout  the period \nApril 2013 to September 2014, all three companies were owned and controlled by the m.  \nAll three companies also appear in the ir lists of assets disclosed in  response to the WFO , \nwhich therefore r eflected the position as at the point of issue of these proceedings.  \n1194.  On 23, 24 or 25 August 2016,  Teide, Goiania  and Pennylane each executed two or more \nbills of sale transferring all its right s, title and interest in such of the nine aircraft  it then \nowned to a Belize company, Perser Holding Limited  (“Perser”) .  The Defendants’ \npleaded case is that , anyway when held by Perser, the ultimate beneficial owner was  \nMr S hkind el, although the bills of sale do not  evidence  the terms on which that \nbeneficial interest came to be tran sferred out of  the Individual Defendants’ ownership, \nas previously held  through Teide, Goiania and Pennylane .  However,  Perser did not \nown the aircraft for more than a fleeting moment because i n each instance, t here was \nthen  an immediate transfer on to the Bank’s Cyprus Branch .  Indeed, o n 22 August \n2016, the day before th e bills of sale were e xecuted, the nine aircraft were recorded in \nthe Bank’s transactional dat a with a n Original 2016 Value of US$163 million , which \nwas then applied  to reduce the recorded balance s on a number of loans, including seven \nof the Relevant Loans . \n1195.  On the same day  that each airc raft was transferred by Perser to the Bank, the interest \nthe Bank  had received in the relevant aircraft was transferred on again by bill of sale to \nDilorsan o.  The total price payable under all nine Dilorsano sale agreements was \nUS$163,891,088.30, which reflected the amount of the credit value applied by the Bank \nin reduction of the balances under (amongst others) the seven Relevant Loans.  \nHowever, t he striking aspect of this part of the series of transactions was that , even \nleaving aside any discrepancy between the  price itself and  the true value of the nine \naircraft,  the terms of the transfer  were so uncommercial from  the Bank ’s perspectiv e \nthat I think that  it was justified in describing them (as it did in its closing submissions) \nas a shockingly bad deal . \n1196.  There were  a number of reasons why the deal was so bad  for the Bank , starting with the \nfact that the bulk of the agreed price under each sale agreement was only payable as a \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n297 \n bullet payment (US$ 104.4 million) after 120 months ."}

For the remainder of the period \nvery small paymen ts were  to be made by Dilorsano to the Bank (for the most part less \nthan 1% of the amount outstanding (described as the buyout price)) , part of which was \nto be applied in reduction of the buyout  price and part of which was in effect equivalent \nto a very small interest payment.   Deferred payment on such terms was very much more \nadvantageous to Dilorsano than it was to the Bank, but this was exacerbated by what \nwas to occur in the event of non -compliance by Dilorsano with its obligations under  the \nsale agreement .  This was a lik ely eventuality in light of the age of the aircraf t and the \nreduction in their value over the course of the 10 year deferral period.  \n1197.  On such non -compliance by Dilorsano , it was open to the Bank to withdraw from the \nagreement and take over and sell the aircraft  at a price not less than that stated by an \nindependent appra iser chosen by the parties.  However , if the proceeds were insufficient \nto cover Dilorsano’s liabilities to the Bank, including the buyout price, Dilorsano would \nnot be liable to the Bank for any shortfall and would be released from any further \nliability unde r the sale agreement.    Dilorsano executed a pledge agreement as security \nfor its obligations under the deferred price sale agreement , described in the pledge as \ncredit facilities extended by the Bank to Dilorsano in a maximum principal aggregate \namount of US $163,891 ,088.   However, the pledge agreement did not affect the release \nand did no more than secure the Bank’s ability to sell the aircraft in due course when \nentitled to do so .  In the event , I did not understand it to be in dispute that, as at 16 June \n2023 , the net amount of principal paid by Dilorsano to the Bank under these \narrangements was US$12.3 million , and there is no evidence that any further payments \nhave be en or are likely to be made to the Bank.  \n1198.  There are some documents which evidence that Dilorsano  was recorded  at the time of \nthe Asset Transfers as being in the ultimate beneficial ownership of Ms Kravchenko .  \nAs I have explained earlier in this judgment , she was an employee of PBC and a \nrecorded beneficial owner of interests in a large number of Borrowers and Intermedia ry \nBorrowers .  There is also documentation which evidence s a transfer of the beneficial \nownership of Dilorsano from Ms Kravchenko to Mr S hkindel  in the middle of \nSeptember 2016.  This was an inexplicable transaction , because it would reflect a \ntransfer in which the same individual was the  ultimate beneficial owner of both the \ntransferor of the aircraft to the Bank and the transferee of the aircraft from the Bank , \nboth of which transfers occurred within a day of each other . \n1199.  Although Mr Shkindel does not feature as a nominee for other entities in which the \nIndividual Defendants held beneficial interests to the same extent as Ms Kravchenko, \nit is most unlikely that he would have held any interest in Dilorsano (or indeed Perser) \non his own account.  He had a longstanding relationship with entities connected to the \nIndividual Defendants , having most recently been a director of PJSC Aviation \nCompany Dniproavia (“Dniproavia”)  and was the general director of the airport it \noperated  at Dnipropetrovsk  at the time of the Asset Transfer s.

The salary he was \ncommanding in 2016 , by which time he had moved to SV -EZHEN LLC, is wholly \nincompatible with any real possibility that he was the true beneficial owner of \nDilorsano , an entity which had apparently just acquired nine aircraft from the Bank and \nincurred liabilities of in excess of US$160 million under that transaction .  He had a \nnumber on the Black and the evidence overall points to him having been an individual \nwho was accustomed to acting in accordance with Mr Kolomoisky’s instructions .   \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n298 \n 1200.  The evidence also supports a finding that both before and after the transfer of the nine \naircraft from Teide , Goian ia and Pennylane to Dilorsano (via Perser and the Bank) , the \naircraft continued to be operated by the same  three lessees : Wind  Rose Aviation \nCompany  (also known as Win drose Airlines ) which operated the two Airbus aircraft , \nJSC Ukraine International Airl ines (“UIA”) which operated the fou r Boeing aircraft \nand Dniproavia which operated the three Embraer aircraft .  There is some evidence that \nMr Kolomoisky had  a controlling interest in Wind Rose and that the other two  are \naircraft operators  / lessors  in which one or both of the Individual Defendants ha d an \ninterest . \n1201.  Quite apart from the wholly uncommercial terms of the sale agreement by the Bank to \nDilorsano, there is other evidence that, subsequent to the date of the Asset Transfers, \nthe ultimate beneficial ownership of the aircraft  remained with the Individual \nDefendants .  Thus , in early September 2016  a list of assets  prepared by Primecap \ncontinued to  treat the aircraft as beneficially  owned as to 50% by Mr Bogolyubov , while \na month or so later  an employee in the Bank’s budgeting department (Ms Melnikova) \nwas giving  information to  Mr Kolomoisky on intra-company transactions as between \nWind Rose and Dilorsano in which she described Dilorsano as “aka Teide” , thereby \nindicating that she at least  continued  to treat Dilorsan o as if it were Teide.   Mr \nKolomoisky continued to be provided with information about Dilorsano’s turnover by \nMr Novikov and Ms Markova for some time thereafter.   There is no explanation as to \nwhy he would have an interest in receiving the information that he did if he did not \ncontinue to have his beneficial interest in Dilorsano, itself th e actual owner of the \naircraft . \n1202.  In my judgment , all of these considerations point to a  conclusion that it is more likely \nthan not that the nine aircraft were not just in the ultimate beneficial ownership of the \nIndividual Defendants prior to the transfer to Perser, but continued to be owned and \ncontrolled by them after they had found their way into the ownership of Dilorsano via \nPerser and the Bank as part of the Asset Transfer s.  In short, t aken together with the \nmore general factors I have described above , I am satisfied that the Bank h as established \nthat, both before and after the transactions relating to the nine aircraft I have described \nabove, the  Individual Defendants were their indirect beneficial owners, such ownership \ninterests being held initially through Teide, Goiania, Pennylane and thereafter through \nDilorsano.  \n1203.  The position in relation to the other assets which were the subject of the Asset Transfer s \nis more straightforward.

It was the Defendants’ case that the Okeanmash office \nbuilding  (also called the Dnipro Office) was not in the ultimate beneficial ownership of \neither of them.  It was transferred to the Bank by Okeanmash LLC and was said by the \nIndividual Defendants to have been beneficially owned by Petro Klymenko.   I do not \naccept this part of their case, which is unsupported by any genuine independent \nevidence and is inconsistent with the surrounding circumstances.  \n1204.  In particular, Mr Klymenko was a director of Paradiz LLC , wh ich was one of the \nBorrowers .  He was also involved in a different capacity as chairman of an insurance \ncompany in which the Individual Defendants accepted that they had an interest \n(although Mr Bogolyubov pleaded that he was not aware of his indirect interest at the \nrelevant time) and which gave a guarantee to the Bank as purported security for the \nBank’s Relevant L oan to Prominent .  This guarantee was absurd on its face because it \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n299 \n was limited to UAH 10,000 , which was effectively useless as security for a Relevant \nLoan of UAH 134 million . \n1205.  Furthermore , Okeanmash was a name that was used for other companies in which the \nIndividual Defendants had an admitted indirect beneficial interest.  While I do not think \nthat this evidence is as strong a connecting factor as the evidence linking the Individual \nDefendants to PBC through the original use of the word Privat  in its name (see \nparagraph 263 of this judgment) , in the absence of any contrary explanation, it does at \nleast point to the probability that  assets including the word  Okeanmash  in their \ndescription belonged to one or other of the Individual Defendants.  \n1206.  As to the petrol stations and the OSFs , most of the interest s which were not admitted to \nhave been held by the Individual Defendants were recorded in the annex as being \nbeneficially held by the Kiperman family.   Yuriy Kiperman was a longstanding \nassociate of both of the Individual Defendants  and both he and his s on Mykhaylo  \nKiperman  had extensions on the Black .  Mykhaylo Kiperman has already featured in \nmy findings relating to the Corporate Defendants, because was also said to have been a \nbeneficial owner of Milbert and (until March 2014) Ukrtransitservice .  It was also \naccepted that he was recorded as an officer of a number of other companies in which \nboth of the In dividual Defendants  also held admitted beneficial interests . \n1207.  There is also evidence that Mykhaylo Kiperman  did not make the ultimate decisions in \nrelation to the use to which these assets  were to be put , a relevant and significant \nexample of which was that Mr Kolomoisky was able to tell Ms Rozhkova that “if the \naforesaid petrol filling stations fail , we will replace them with other ones” .

This was well -illustrated by an analysis of the available evidence in relation to the 28 \npetrol stations transf erred to the Bank  as part of the Asset Transfer s by Frontli ght Media \nLLC  (“Frontlight”)  and VK Amara nt LLC  (“VK Amarant”) .  The Individual \nDefendants’ pleaded assertion (as particularised in an amended annex to Mr \nKolomoisky’s response dated 30 July 2021  referred to in paragraph  1184  above ) was \nthat the ultimate beneficial owners of those assets  were the Kipermans .  However , \nFrontli ght only became an owner of its transferred petrol stations shortly before the \nAsset Transfer s, having acquired them as a result of an in -kind contribution made by a \ncompany called Novel Estate LLC which itself was owned by a number of companies \nin which both Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov had disclosed an interest in the asset \ndisclosure .  There is no explanation for this connection  via Frontli ght and Novel Estate  \nand, despite what has been asserted by the Individual Defenda nts, there is no supporting \nevidence to demonstrate that the Kiperman s played any role in what occurred on their \naccount or for their own benefit  or to explain why it was in their interests for the ir assets \nto be used in this way . \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n300 \n 1210.  There was a similar story in relation to the petrol station s transferred to the Bank by \nVK Amarant as part of the Asset Transfer s, also said to be assets of which the \nKipermans were ultimate beneficial owners.  The original owners were Cherkassy -oil-\n2008 LLC and Yunomi LLC .  There is evidence that both Mr Kolomoisky and Mr \nBogolyubov had interests in Cherkassy  and more generally that Mr Bogolyubov has \npreviously admitted to an interest in VK Amarant .  As with the petro l stations \ntransferred to the Bank  from  Frontlight , there is no supporting evidence to demonstrate \nthat the Kipermans played any role in what occurred on their account or for their own \nbenefit .  The same can be said about the only other person said to be the ultimate \nbeneficial owner of anything other t han a de minim is interest in the petrol stations and \nOSFs: Mr Igor Palytsia , formerly the Governor of Odessa and described by Mr \nKolomoisky as one of his close associates.   There is nothing in the papers to \ndemonstrate that he played any part in the Asset Tra nsfers or to explain why it was in \nhis interests for his assets to be used in this way.  \n1211.  Mr Bogolyubov sought to distance himself from the Asset Transfer s, a position which \nwas consistent with  his case on the Deed s of Waiver  and Indemnity  and his case  that \nfrom July 2014 he had been acting at the sole direction of Mr Kolomoisky .  Thus, and \nas I have already explain ed, although he was prepared to confirm that he was happy to \nproceed for the purposes of the se proceedings on the basis that the information provided \nby Mr Kolomoisky’s responses dated  30 July 2021 were accurate, he  asserted through \nhis solicitors that he  was unable to verify that they were.   The Bank submitted that his \nasserted inability to verify was a lie, and that the true  position was that he had simply \nchosen not  to verify what he knew was accurate in respect of the admissions made by \nMr Kolomoisky and what was inaccurate to the extent that Mr Kolomoisky contended \nthat others , such as members of the Kiperman family , were the ultimate beneficial \nowners of a Transferred Asset . \n1212.

I accept that Mr Bogolyubov’s  answer on this issue was misleading.  It gives the \nimpression that he was unable to verify any of the information, even though the Bank \nhad been pressing for an answer for many months before .  In my view it is  plain that \nmuch of it was  available to him , as partly evidence d by the disclosure he had given in \nthe Tatneft Proceedings , relating to the period in which the Asset Transfers were taking \nplace .  Thus, Mr Bogolyubov said in his Tatneft disclosure that he had a  15% interest  \nin VK Amarant while, as I have explained above, Mr Kolomoisky ’s case in these \nproceedings, said by Mr Bogolyubov to be accepted by him without the ability to verify, \nis that it was owned as to 100% by the Kipermans.  There was a similar discrepancy in \nrelation to a holding he had identified in the Tatneft disclosure as being a 29.7 27% \ninterest in Ukr -Prom -Trade Ltd .  In the particulars accepted by Mr Bogolyub ov as \naccurate for the purpose of these  proceedings (albeit unverified), Mr Kolomoisky \noriginally listed this interest  as being  100% in the beneficial ownership of the Kiperman \nfamily, although  this was then changed in a re -amended  version of Mr Kolomoisky’s \nlist to interests held as to 45% each by Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov and as to \n10% held by Mr Palytsia and his family.  \n1213.  In answer to Mr Bogolyubov’s case that he was by then no longer involved in the affairs \nof the Bank save by acting in accordance with Mr Kolomoisky’s instructions, a case \nwhich he was not prepared to support by attending to give evidence on his own behalf, \nthe Bank relied on the fact that , for most of the period in which  the Asset Transfer s \nwere being planned  and impl emented  as part of the Restructuring Plan , one of the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n301 \n substantial assets initially proposed to be transferred  (Hotel Split valued at UAH 4.44 \nbillion ) was in the sole ownership of Mr Bogolyubov .  It was only at the beginning of \nSeptember 2016 that it was excluded from the list of assets to be transferred on grounds \nwhich are not entirely clear , but which appear to have related to the funding being \nprovided by Sberbank  Zagreb  rather than  any reluctance by Mr Bogolyubov to allow \nhis assets to be used as part of the Asset Transfers .  The Bank  also relied on the f act \nthat there was a significant amount of documentary evidence which establish ed that \nboth of the Individual Defendants were directly involved in identifying the assets to be \ntransferred, the majority of which were assets in which they admitted they held an \ninterest.  In the case of Mr Bogolyubov that involvement was normally through Mr \nAnischenko, who (as I explained at the beginning of this judgment) was  his personal \nassistant involved in the administration of some of his personal investments , although \nothers , who were advising Mr Bogolyubov specifically in relation to his own position , \nincluded Mr Ruvinskiy .  There is also some evidence of direct communication between \nMr Bogolyubov and Mr Dubilet . \n1214.  The significance of my finding that all of the Transferred Assets were in the ultimate \nbeneficial ownership of one or both of the Individual Defendants at the time of the Asset \nTransfers is that it demonstrates that both of them  were much more intimately involved \nin the whole process of responding to the NBU’s attempt to force a genuine \nrecapitalisation of the Bank than they have been prepared  to accept .

The significance of my finding that all of the Transferred Assets were in the ultimate \nbeneficial ownership of one or both of the Individual Defendants at the time of the Asset \nTransfers is that it demonstrates that both of them  were much more intimately involved \nin the whole process of responding to the NBU’s attempt to force a genuine \nrecapitalisation of the Bank than they have been prepared  to accept .  It also makes it \nmuch more likely that they had a good idea of the true value of the Transferred Assets \nand knew  that the credit values  which were rec orded in the Bank’s books at the time of \nthe Asset Transfers did not represe nt their true value.   This in turn would give rise to a \npowerful inference of bad faith on the part of the trans feror of the relevant assets , with \nthe consequence as I have already explained  that the Bank would not be bound by the \ncredit values which were applied in its books as a result of the Asset Transfer s. This is \nthe case,  whether or not it  gave restitution of the Transferred Assets  to the transferor , \nalthough if it did not do  so, it would be bound to give credit for its true value , a \nconsequence which the Bank accepts . \n1215.  As a matter of common sense, the greater the discrepancy between the credit value of \na Transferred Asset and its true value, the more likely it is that the Individual \nDefendants as the true owners of the Transferred Assets will have known that the credit \nvalue given in the Bank’s books was in fact an undervalue.  Furthermore, there are a \nnumber of instances in which there is good evidence that the Individual Defendants \nmust have known that the true value of a Transferred Asset was materially less than its \ncredit value.  I shall refer to the specific instances relied on by the Bank when explaining \nbelow my findings in relation to the true value of the relevant Transferred Asset.  \n \nRelevance of the Valuation  of the Share Pledges  \n1216.  It was always the Defendants’ case that the 28 Share Pledges charged shares in 21 \ncompanies as security, for amongst other indebtedness, the Relevant Loans.  The value \nof the Share Pledges was recorded in the pledge documentation as at the years ending \n31 December 2013 (UAH 10.7 billion), 31 December 2014 (UAH 68.7 billion) and 31 \nDecember 2015 (UAH 110 billion) as summarised in tables prepared by the experts.  \nThe Defendants relied on this evidence in support of their argument that the Relevant \nLoans were always fully secured.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n302 \n 1217.  It was the Bank’s case not only that the Share Pledges were shams put in place as part \nof the Individual Defendant s’ efforts to conceal the Misappropriation, but also that the \nassets over which they were granted as security were grossly overvalued.  The \nallegation of gross overvaluation was always likely to be established because even Mr \nKolomoisky’s own expert share va luer (Mr Travis Taylor) was of the opinion that their \ntrue value was only a small fraction of the values given in the Shares Pledges \nthemsel ves as at the three chosen valuation dates.  In short there was never any expert \nevidence to substantiate an argument that the values attributed to the underlying assets \nin the Share Pledges bore any resemblance to their true value.  \n1218.  In the event, at the end of Day 17 of the trial, during the course of a timetabling \ndiscussion shortly before Mr Taylor was due to give evidence, Mr Howard announced \nthat he was not going to call Mr Taylor and that he would not be cross -examining the \nBank’ s expert (Mr Mark Bezant) on his evidence as to the value of the shares pledged \nby the Share Pledges.  This meant that Mr Bezant’s evidence stood unchallenged and \nestablished that (a) the value of the pledged shares as at 31 December 2013 was 3.6% \nof the v alue attrib"}

This meant that Mr Bezant’s evidence stood unchallenged and \nestablished that (a) the value of the pledged shares as at 31 December 2013 was 3.6% \nof the v alue attributed to them in the Shares Pledges,  (b) the value of the pledged shares \nas 31 December 2014 was 9.3% of the value attributed to them in the Share Pledges \nand (c) the value of the pledged shares as at 31 December 2015 was 11.5% of the value \nattributed to them in the Shares Pledges.  \n1219.  The discrepancy between the values attributed to the shares in the Share Pledges and \ntheir true value does not just demonstrate that the Bank’s security was deficient.  The \namount of the discrepancy is so large that, taken without more, it points to delibe rate \nmanipulation of the values which were recorded on the faces of the Share Pledges \nthemselves.  In my view this is confirmed by other documentation put in evidence \nduring the course of the trial which establishes that these valuations were simply made \nup by employees within BOK.  I was taken to two examples, the first of which was \nparticularly striking.  \n1220.  This first example was Feyen Consulting Limited’s pledge of its shares in Goiania.  The \nShare Pledge value as at 24 March 2014 was recorded as having been agreed between \nthe Bank and Feyen Consulting as UAH 1.2 billion for 24.5% of the company’s capital.  \nIt was then recorded in an amending agreement as having shrunk to a value of UAH \n380 million as at 30 June 2014 (i.e. the value of the company is recorded as having \ncollapsed from UAH 4.8 billion to UAH 1.5 billion in the space of three months).  More \ndram atically still, a further amending agreement for the same Share Pledge dated 29 \nDecember 2014 recorded that six months later the same block of 24.5% of Goiania’s \ncapital was recorded as having increased in value to UAH 2.3 billion (i.e. a value for \n100% of  Goiania of approximately UAH 9.2 billion), a six -fold increase from the value \ngiven six months earlier.  \n1221.  Just over a year later (on 12 January 2016), there were illustrations of similar wide \ndisparities in the valuation of the same assets pledged under a Share Pledge.  In a credit \ncommittee presentation supporting a loan to one of the Intermediary Borrowers, \nRetonga LLC, 100% of Goiania was given a value of UAH 7.35 billion, while on the \nvery same day and apparently for the same meeting, a second credit committee \npresentation supporting a loan to another borrower, Sigmatreyder LLC, valued 100% \nof the equity ri ghts in Goiania at UAH 9.26 billion. Two days later there was another \ncredit committee presentation, which seems to have been prepared by the same \nindividual who prepared the Retonga presentation, this time in support of a loan to \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n303 \n another Intermediary Borrower, Starma LLC.  This presentation valued what were \ndescribed as 100% of the profit participation rights in Goiania at UAH 14.27 billion, \nalmost twice as much as the value which had been attributed to the equity interest two \ndays earlier.  \n1222.  I am satisfied that the only possible explanation for these otherwise inexplicable \ndisparities in the declared value of the same security is that the employees within BOK \nwho prepared the relevant documentation included figures which had no relationship to  \nthe true value of the underlying asset.  I also find that this conduct must have been \ndeliberate, because it is inconceivable that those same employees did not know about \nthe value discrepancies, given the way in which the information was prepared and the  \nidentity of the indi"}

Despite their knowledge of those discrepancies, \nthere is no recorded explanation for those discrepancies, a fact which gives rise to a \nclear inference that both those who prepared the information and those within th e Bank \nto whom it was addressed (for the most part the members of the credit committee) must \nhave been aware that the figures so recorded were not a fair or genuine reflection of the \ntrue value of the underlying assets.  \n1223.  The second was the pledge by Panikos Symeou of his interest in 49% of the shares in \nClendon Holdings recorded as worth UAH 37.6 billion as at 30 March 2016.  A further \namending agreement was then produced the following day which increased the \nvaluation to UAH 44.5 billion.  This conduct is consistent with a simple correction of \nthe wrong figure in an earlier agreement.  However it is also consistent with the \nemployees concerned taking an entirely random approach to whatever figure was \nrequired for the purpo se for which the presentation had been prepared, without any \nproper regard to what might have been the true value of the asset.  In all the \ncircumstances I think that the latter is much the most likely explanation for the \ndiscrepancy.  \n1224.  In my judgment the way in which individuals within BOK approached their valuation \nof the Share Pledges is relevant to an assessment of the probabilities when it comes to \nanalysing the evidence on undervalue of the Transferred Assets.  The same department \nwithin the Bank was responsible for providing data for the valuations obtained for the \npurposes of the Asset Transfer s.  The extraordinary disparity in the Share Pledge \nvaluations between their attributed value and what can now clearly be seen as their true  \nvalue, the evident manipulation of the figures and the involvement of the same \nindividuals in both exercises supports a conclusion that,  when instructed to do so  \n(instructions which I infer ultimately came from Mr Kolomoisky with the approval and \nconsent of Mr Bogolyubov) , those same individuals were prepared to act in a dishonest \nmanner to achieve the similar end of giving the appearance that the Bank’s capital \nposition was more secure than in fact it was.  \n \nAsset Transfers : the expert v aluation evidence  \n1225.  A significant  part of the trial was  spent on the expert evidence adduced by the parties \nin relation to the value of  the Transferred A ssets.   The Bank’s evidence on the valuation \nof the petrol stations, the OS Fs, Hotel Zirka, Hotel Mir and the office buildings was \ngiven by Mr Mark Be zant, a UK-based chartered accountant and a senior managing \ndirector at FTI Consulting LLP  with 30 years’ experience of valuing business assets, \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n304 \n including  some located  in Ukraine .  He leads FTI’s economic and consulting practice \nin EMEA .  The Bank’s evidence on the valuation of the Stadium , the Training Centre \nand the Airfield was given by Mr Paul Thomas , a valuer with 40 years’ experience  \nincluding over 25 years in Ukraine.  He is the President and a partner in IRE USA Inc \nand IRE Ukraine LLC , which he described as a full -service appraisal firm based in \nKyiv .

The expert evidence for the Defendants was all adduced by Mr Kolomoisky .  Mr \nBogolyubov  did not call any evidence of his own, preferring , in order to avoid \nduplication , to adopt Mr Kolomoisky’s submissions on valuation.  The Corporate \nDefendants adopted a similar position , having obtained an order at the first CMC \npermitting them to rely on Mr Kolomoisky’s valuation experts at the trial.  \n1227.  Mr Kolomoisky ’s expert evidence came from two valuers.  The first was Mr Brent \nKacz marek, a US-based chartered financial analyst  and partner in the Arlington office \nof IAV Advisors LLC , with wide experience of valuing business assets throughout the \nworld including in Ukraine .  He addressed the value of all of the real property assets: \nthe petrol stations, the OSFs , Hotel Mir, the office buildings, the Stadium, the Training \nCentre and the Airfield.  The second was Mr Philip Seymour , who gave evidence for \nthe Defendants on the valuation of the aircraft.  He is  based in the UK, is a director of \nthe International Bureau of Aviation Group Limited (“IBA”) and an  ISTAT -certified \nsenior aircraft appraiser with 28 years’ experience in providing aircraft and appraisal \nservice s. \n1228.  All of the experts had relevant expertise , but I formed very different views of the quality \nof their evidence . \n1229.  Mr Bezant was an impressive witness. He gave careful and straightforward evidence, \nexpressing his views with clarity and precision. It was obvious that he was experienced \nin giving evidence, but he did not come across as having been overtrained.  Although \nin general he was on top of the material, there were occasions on which he had forgotten \nsome of the detail.  However, that did not impact upon his ability to assist the court on \nthe central questions.  There were a few occasions on which he came close to slipping \ninto advocacy, but in the event he never did so and I do not consider that his evidence \nwas ever anything other than a genuine and independent -minded reflection of his own \nviews.  \n1230.  In a judgment I gave in unrelated litigation  (Bank St Petersburg OJSC  v. Arkhangelsky  \n[2022] EWHC 2499 (Ch)  at [472] ), I had criticised the quality of  Mr Thomas ’ evidence \nas betraying a marked failure to recognise that his role was to assist the court by an \nindependent and dispassionate statement of his views without descending into the arena \nto argue the counterclaimants’ case on their behalf.   Not surprisingly , he was taxed \nwith this in cross -examination  and accepted that the criticisms I had made of his  \nevidence in that case were fair.   However, his evidence in these proceedings was in \nmarked contrast to his evidence in the Bank St Petersburg  case.  While h e was firm in \nthe views that he expressed , he did not cross the line into advocacy and  explained the \nconcepts on which he relied with clarity .  He was confident in his opinions, and \njustifiably so.  My overall impression was not just that he knew what he was talkin g \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n305 \n about , but also that he addressed the issues with which he had bee n asked to deal in a \nfair and balanced manner . \n1231.

I did not find Mr Kaczmarek to be a very impressive witness .  He was too argumentative \nabout the underlying data and always seemed to want to have a battle .  Whe n faced with \naccurate data that he did not like he tended to question  its reliability and there were a \nnumber of occasions when he refused to agree the obvious .  There were also occasions \nto which I will come in due course in which his evidence bordered on the misleading .  \nHe had a tendency to improvise, seem ingly happy to speculate when it suited t he case \nhe was advancing on behalf of his client  and sometimes thinking up answers on the spot \nwithout having thought through their plausibility .  Overall,  I formed the view that he \nfound great difficulty in giving dispassionate evidence that could properly be regarded \nas independent.  \n1232.  Both Ms Razzhivi na and Mr Seymour gave concise evidence which reflected their \nhonest opinions without  straying into advocacy.  However, Mr Seymour made a number \nof basic errors in his original report which were later corrected , but which caused me \nto have some concerns about the accuracy of what he had to say where he differed from \nMs Razz hivina.   I must also record that there was one other aspect of Mr Seymour’s \nevidence which caused me real concern  as to the seriousness with which he had \nundertaken his ov erriding duty to the court .  In the ultimate analysis , what I shall now \ndescribe  does not of itself  mean that  it was appropriate to disregard  his evidence, but it \ndoes mean that I have found it necessary to scrutinise  the foundation for his opinions \nwith particular care.  \n1233.  In two previous cases , Pindell Limited  v. Airasia Berhad  [2010] EWHC 2516 (Comm)  \nand ACG Acquisition XX LLC  v. Olympic Airlines  [2012] EWHC 1070 (Comm), Mr \nSeymou r’s evidence had not been accepted by judges of the Commercial Court .  In the \nsecond of those cases,  ACG  (at para 50) , Teare J had held that Mr Seymour had not \ngiven sufficient consideration to his duty to the court not to omit matters which might \ndetract from his stated opinio n, having regard to some of the findings made by \nTomlinson J in Pindell .  The consequence of this in ACG  was that Teare J was unable \nto rely on his evidence , save when accepted by the other expert.  \n1234.  These criticisms took on a further  level of significance in light of the judgment in \nPeregrine Aviation  v. Laudamotion  [2023] EWHC 48 (Comm)  at [22] , in which it was \nnoted by Henshaw J that “Mr Seymour ought to have disclosed criticisms of his \nevidence in two previous judgments as part of or in conjunction with his expert report \nin that case”.   Henshaw J’s judgment was handed down on 17 January 2023 but , despite \nthis timely reminder  of his duties , it was only six months later, a mere three days before \nhis cross-examination in th ese proceedings , that Mr Kolomoisky’s solicitors disclosed \nto the Bank’s solicitors what had been said.   In cross -examination, Mr Seymour said \nthat he thought he had forwarded what had been said in Peregrine  to the lawyers  at an \nearlier stage .  I have no means of knowing whether he did in fact do so, but I consider \nthat he should have  ensure d that this information was made available to the Bank and \nthe court much earlier than he did.   In that respect he was in breach of his  own personal \nduty to the court .  This failing  made an evaluation of the credibility of his evidence a \nmore difficult task than would otherwise have be en the case.  \n \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n306 \n Asset Transfers: value of the Petrol Stations  \n1"}

The credit value attributed to the 246 petrol stations (i.e. their Original 2016 Value) was \nUAH 6,341 million.  Their Restated  2016 Value (based on a report prepared by Volyn) \nwas UAH 1,852 million.  The value attributed to the m by Mr Bezant  was UAH 1,869 \nmillion , which was very substantially less th an their Original 2016 Value and  \nmarginally in excess of their Restated 2016 Value .  The value attributed to them by Mr \nKaczmarek was UAH 8,444 million  (the mean  between a discounted cas h flow (“DCF ”) \nvaluation of UAH 8,527 million and a market approach valuation of UAH  8,360 \nmillion) , which was very substantially in excess of both their Original 2016 Value and \ntheir Restated 2016 Value .  The difference between the parties’ respective valuations \nwas therefore UAH 6, 575 million  and the amount by which the Bank claimed that their \nOriginal 2016 Value  exceeded their true value was UAH 4,472 mil lion. \n1236.  The Defendants submitted that the fact that the Original 2016 Value  applied by the \nBank was less than Mr Kaczmarek’s valuation  itself gives the lie to the suggestion that \nthese credit values were the result of fraud, or that the Bank has given excessive credit \nfor the value of the Petrol Stations.   I do not think that that follows.  It all depends on \nthe extent to which any overstatement of value by Mr Kaczmarek was driven by \nunreliable dat a and an erroneous application of other valuation inputs.   \n1237.  The instructions given to the expert valuers were different .  Mr Bezant was instructed \nto assess the market value of the petrol stations as at the date they were transferred to \nthe Bank.  In expressing his opinion, Mr Bezant used the definition of market value in \nthe 2013 edition of the International Valuation Standards (“IVS”), being:  \n“… the estimated amount for which an asset or liability should exchange on the \nvaluation date between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s length \ntransaction, after proper marketing and where the parties had each acted \nknowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.”  \n1238.  Mr Kaczmarek was instructed to assess whether the Transferred Assets as reported in  \nits 2016  financial statements  were valued in accordance with International Financial \nReporting Standards (“IFRS”) 13 , and , if they did not, to explain why that was and to \nprovide his own independent valuation.   He was also asked to give his opinion on  \ncompliance with IFR S 13 for the Bank’s 2017 and 2018 financial statements.   Mr \nKaczmarek  performed his valuation using a fair value standard,  which he described  as \nbeing : \n“the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an \norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.. […] fair \nvalue is a market -based measurement, not an entity -specific measurement, and, as \nsuch, is determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in \npricing the asset or liability. The transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability \nis a hypothetical transaction as at the measurement date that is assumed to be \norder ly and considers an appropriate period of exposure to the market.” . \n1239.  In Mr  Bezant’s view , the choice of market value or fair value should not affect the \nvaluation of the Transferred Assets.   In Mr Kaczmarek’s view , fair value and market \nvalue  are very similar standards, although fair value is more prescriptive in its \nApproved Judg"}

In Mr  Bezant’s view , the choice of market value or fair value should not affect the \nvaluation of the Transferred Assets.   In Mr Kaczmarek’s view , fair value and market \nvalue  are very similar standards, although fair value is more prescriptive in its \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n307 \n implementation than market value .  However, both experts agreed  that the difference \nin standard of value did not drive any differences in their respective opinions . \n1240.  The same can be said of  the differences between the experts on the chosen valuation \ndate: Mr Bezant used 1 September 2016 being the midpoint in the period over which \nthe Transferred Assets were transferred to the Bank, while Mr Kaczmarek used 31 \nDecember 2016, which is the date of the Bank’s 2016 financial statements.  These \ndifferences do not of themselves explain  any of the differences between them on the ir \nvaluation s of the petrol stations , although it may affect the value of some of the other \nTransferre d Assets . \n1241.  Having regard to the fact that Mr Bezant based his valuation solely on a DCF  analysis, \nwhile Mr Kaczmarek based his as to 50% on a DCF analysis and as to 50% on what he \ncalled a market approach, t he differences which did arise derived from  a number of \ndifferent factors .  As Mr Bezant explained, the DCF analysis involve s an estimat e of \ncash flows for a forecast period until the business is considered stable, after which a \nterminal value is calculated .  The terminal value is then intended to capture cash flow s \ninto perpetuity based on a long -term growth rate.   Cash flows are then discounted back \nto the valuation date using a discount rate, usual ly the weighted average cost of capital \n(“WACC”).  \n1242.  The joint statement made clear that the three main areas of disagreement between the  \nexperts  in the ir DCF analyses related to the volume of fuel sales , the application of the \nprinciples of return on new invested capital (“ RONIC ”) and the application of  the \nappropriate country risk premium (“CRP”)  in their assessment of the appropriate \ndiscount rate . \n1243.  Of these , the most substantial difference  related to the respective assumptions they \nmade about the volume of fuel sales , being  the principal driver of a petrol station’s \nvalue .  The impact on their respective valuations was very subs tantial indeed, \namounting to c. UAH 3 .1 billion. The reason for  the differences in the assumptions made \nby the experts as to fuel sales volume  was that they both relied on different  data \nproduced by the Bank for different purposes .  Both experts agreed that a reliable DCF \nvaluat ion of the petrol stations can only be carried out if they are able to work with \nreliable fuel sales volume data.  They also both  agreed  that the correct fuel volumes to \nuse as inputs for valuation purposes is ultimately a question of fact for the court.  \n \nPetrol station valu ations : fuel volumes  \n1244.  In reaching his conclusions on the value of the petrol stations, Mr Kaczmarek had \nparticular  regard to three of the four reports  which  underpinned the Original 2016 \nValues for the petrol stations .  The first of the se four reports , which was not one which  \nMr Kaczmarek  said he had used for fuel volume purposes,  was a report prepared by \nBaker Tilly dated 12 May 2016  but with a valuation given as of 31 December 2015 .  \nThere were then two reports prepared by  Universal Commodity Exchange (“UCE”)  \nwhich valued all but one of the 246 petrol stations , one dated  (and as of ) 4 May 2016 \nusing a DCF approach and the other dated (and as of ) 12 May 2016 using a \ncapitalisation approach .

It \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n308 \n valued 216 of the 246 petrol stations transferred as part of the Asset Transfer s.  The \ndata provided to BT related to 2015 only, while the dat a provided to UCE and Veritas \nalso related to the first half of 2016.   For the purposes of his valuation, Mr Kaczmarek \nused the  data provided to UCE and Veritas . \n1245.  Mr Be zant did not use these reports o r the data contained within them for the purposes \nof his valuation.  He used a combination of a later valuation report produced by Volyn \nin March 2019 and market data cross -checks.  The Volyn report  (together with other \nlater report s prepared by Expert+ ) was the basis for the Restated 2016 Values as a result \nof which the Bank’s 2016 balance sheet was restated in its 2018 financia l statements.   \nVolyn  was not provided with  historical operational data, but instead relied on  the results \nof field studies and an estimation of fuel sales volumes from comparable petrol stations , \nan approach which Mr Bezant accepted in cross -examination was unusual . \n1246.  The reason Mr Bezant  did not use the reports which underpinned the Original 2016 \nValues for the petrol stations  was that he considered that there  were fundamental \nproblems with the data provided to the valuers , which had  emanated from within the \nBank .  He explained how th is was apparent from  major discrepancies in the sales \nvolume data, which was apparent from a comparison of the data  provided to BT on the \none hand and the data provided  to UCE and Veritas on the other .  The data purported \nto reflect the actual fuel sales volumes for the same petrol stations during the same \nperiod in 2015.  It should therefore have been the same when presented both to UCE / \nVeritas and to BT, but that was not the case.  This was illustrated by a detailed appendix \nexhibited to Mr Bezant’s  supplemental report , which bear s out the fact that there are \nfundamental inconsistencies in the data for all categories of fuel (A -92 petrol , A-95 \npetrol and Diesel ) which UCE / Veritas and BT  were informed had been sold in the \npetrol stations and which were the subject matter of their reports .  If the figures were \ngenuine, they should have been the same, but they were not.  \n1247.  The Bank submitted that the consequence of these discrepancies was that the fuel \nvolume figures on which UCE / Veritas and BT all based their conclusions were highly \nunreliabl e.  Indeed, it went further and challenged the authenticity of the data not just \nby comparing what was provided to UCE / Veritas on the one hand and to BT on the \nother , but also on the basis that there was clear evidence  that the data had been \ndeliberate ly manipulated by employees within  BOK .  To explain why that is the case, \nit is nec essary to go back to early 2015 . \n1248.  On 19 March 201 5, Archem Chernyshov , a lending specialist for monitoring credit and \nleasing operations within BOK,  prepared a document  referred to at the trial as the \nTopchy spreadsheet .  This  was prepared for security valuation purposes and recorded \ntwo sets of monthly fuel volume data for 994 petrol stations (including 243 of the 246 \ntransferred as part of the Asset Transfer s) for the period January 2014 to February 2015 \n(inclusive) .

{"start": 1158500, "text": " early 2015 . \n1248.  On 19 March 201 5, Archem Chernyshov , a lending specialist for monitoring credit and \nleasing operations within BOK,  prepared a document  referred to at the trial as the \nTopchy spreadsheet .  This  was prepared for security valuation purposes and recorded \ntwo sets of monthly fuel volume data for 994 petrol stations (including 243 of the 246 \ntransferred as part of the Asset Transfer s) for the period January 2014 to February 2015 \n(inclusive) .  It was called the Topch y spreadsheet because one of t he two sets of data \nfor each petrol station was in a series of columns entitled T OPCHII .  The other set of \ndata was in a series of columns entitled Valuation.   \n1249.  The title TOPCHII was almost certainly a reference to Yuri Topchy, a senior employee \nof Oil Ukraine, the company responsible for administering the Individual Defendants’ \noil and gas interests.  Mr Topchy also had an extension on the Black and had in the pa st \nprovided information to the Bank about the petrol station interests held by the \nIndividual Defendants.   Mr Kaczmarek accepted as a fair assumption the Bank’s \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n309 \n suggestion that the inference to be drawn from this spreadsheet is that the columns \nentitled TOPCHII were derived from data supplied by Mr Topchy.  He gave that \nevidence with the benefit of his previous knowledge of the Individual Defendants’ oil \nand gas i nterests obtained during the course of two ICSID arbitrations in which he gave \nevidence for Mr  Kolomoisky.   I find that this was indeed the case.  \n1250.  Across the 994 petrol stations listed  in the Topchy spreadsheet , the overall sales of three \ncategories of fuel, A -92 petrol, A -95 petrol and diesel, was recorded in the TOPCHII \ncolumns as being 371 million Kg, 286 million Kg and 404 million Kg respectively.   \nAcross the 994 petrol stations listed, the overall sales of A -92 petrol, A -95 petrol and \ndiesel was recorded in the Valuation columns as being 666 million Kg, 448 million Kg \nand 1,545 million Kg respectively.   It follows that, t aken across the board, th e fuel sales \nvolumes recorded in the Valuation columns of the Top chy spreadsheet  were \nsubstantially more than twice as much (by an average increase of 241%) as the volumes \nrecorded in the TOPCHII columns.  \n1251.  I think it is right to infer, both from the form of the spreadsheet itself and from the \nmatters which I shall explain shortly, that the TOPCHII columns contained data which \nbroadly reflected the true position as reported by Mr Topchy, while the columns hea ded \nValuation reflected the data intended to be supplied to valuers.   In other words, the \nclear inference is that the fuel sales volume data to be supplied for valuation purposes \nwas deliberately increased from the real volumes in order to enhance the pro spects of \nachieving a greater value for the underlying assets (i.e. the relevant petrol stations).   \nFurthermore, a careful analysi s of the Topchy spreadsheet discloses other indications \nthat the figures in the Valuation columns bore no resemblance to reality.  Thus, the \nsame percentage increases in the three categories of fuel were applied month after \nmonth throughout the period January 2014 to February 20 15 to the TOPCH II sales \nvolume figures for the same petrol station . \n1252.  The Topchy spreadsheet was  not prepared  for the purposes of providing data to valuers \nfor the Asset Transfers (it was produced some time before then) .  Rather it was prepared  \nin order to provide data to BT for a valuation report it had been instructed the previous \nday to produce in response to a request from the Bank’s auditors, PwC , relating to the \nvaluation of security which had been pledged to the Bank .

As Mr Kaczmarek accepted \nin cross -examination, the data in the Valuation columns was then used by BT for the \npurposes of calculating a daily fuel sales volume for that report, which was finalised on \n22 April 2015.   The Bank established this was the case, not just through Mr \nKaczmarek’s opinion but also by a comparison of the BT report’s analysis of the \naverage daily fuel volume sales for each  fuel type sold at each  petrol station with the \nmonthly fuel volume sales recorded in the Valuation columns for the Topchy \nspreadsheet.   The comparative data matched.  It follows therefore that, i n this context, \nBT’s use of the figures derived from the  Valuation column s in the Topchy spreadsheet \nseriously distorted its 2015 valuation because they purported to record fuel sales \nvolumes which were  substantia lly more than twice the real position.   The arbitrary \nmanner in which this was done gives rise to a strong  inference that this exercise was \ndeliberate ly designed to mislead PwC as the Bank’s auditors and the NBU.    \n1253.  It is apparent that the figures in the Topchy spreadsheet  were then used again in 2016 \nas a base to underpin the fuel volume input for the valuation reports produced by BT \nand UCE / Veritas  in relation to the Asset Transfers .  The way it worked was different \nfor UCE / Veritas on the one hand and BT on the other .  The overall  increase in the fuel \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n310 \n sales volume data for each of the reports  was similar, a fact to  which Mr Kaczmarek \npointed when explaining why it could be relied on, but critically the component \nelement s to make up the final aggregate amounts  were very different .  More \nsignificantly, t he evidence in support of a conclusion that it was manipulated from \nwithin BOK before it was used by the valuers is compelling . \n1254.  I can deal first with the use of the Topchy spreadsheet in relation to the  preparation of \nthe BT report .  BT was instructed in December 2015 to pr epare  a further valuation \nreport for the 994 petrol stations as at 31 December 2015.    As I have already explained, \nby this stage there was grow ing pressure from the NBU for the Individual Defendant s \nto procure a very substantial increase in the Bank’s capital and I think it is like ly that a \ntransfer of assets such as the petrol stations was within their contemplation  as one of \nthe means by which this might be achieved .  The underlying data was therefore to be \nprovided to BT for valuation purposes less than a year after provision of the comparable \ndata for the purposes of its April 2015 security report . \n1255.  This further report  was the n finalis ed and dated 12 May 2016 .  As Mr Kaczmarek \nagree d, the data on which BT relied demonstrated that the petrol  stations were selling \nsubstantially more diesel than petrol.   This was consistent with the position disclosed \nin BT’s earlier 2015 report , a conclusion which the Bank suggested (and I accept) was \nnecessary to ensure tha t BT were not alerted to inconsistencies between the two reports \ngiven that the time periods for which they were prepared  were relatively close to ea ch \nother .  However this broad conclusion was wholly inconsistent  with the underlying data \nused by UCE and Veritas for the purpos e of preparing their reports.  \n1256.  The UCE report was commissioned on 25 April 2016 and the Veritas report was \ncommissioned  on 25 July 2016 .

The y both valued the majority but not quite  all of the \n246 petrol stat ions to be transferred as part of the Asset Trans fers.  But it is apparent \nfrom the experts’ analysis of the data that UCE and Veritas  used radically different fuel \nsales volume figures from those which were used in the BT report .  This is evidenced \nnot just by a comparison of the datasets for individual petrol stations, but also mor e \ngenerally from the aggregate sales volumes they used  for the different fuel catego ries.  \nThus, t he BT figures for diesel sales were significantly higher than those used by UCE \n/ Veritas and significantly exceeded total petrol sales , while the UCE / Veritas figures  \nwere the reverse : their  figures for petrol sales were significantly higher than those used \nby BT and significantly exceeded  diesel sales.  \n1257.  The circumstances in which the arbitr ary nature of the sales volume  figures used by \nUCE and Veritas came to be used can be pieced together from some of the surviving \ndocumentation.  What happened can be ascertained from a further spreadsheet  prepared \nby Mr Chernyshov which purport ed to record fuel sales for the period January 2015 t o \nJune 2016 .  The version in the trial bundles was dated 2 August 2016.   As M r \nKaczmarek accepted , this was the same data as that which was used by UCE and Veritas \nto prepare their reports, and was therefore the data on  which Mr Kaczmarek relied in \npreparing his report for the purposes of these proceedings . \n1258.  However, it is certain that the data purporting to record  the fuel sales volumes for the \ntwo months  for which there was an overlap between the  period covered by the  Topchy \nspreadsheets (January 2014 to February 2015) and the period covered by the August \n2016 spreadsheets (January 2015 to June 2016) was significantly inflated on a wholly \narbitrary basis .  This is clear from a comparison of the two spreadsheets which \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n311 \n establishes that, in the vast majority of cases , the figures included  in the August 2016 \nspreadsheet for the two months’ period of overlap were based on the TOPCHII columns \nof the Topchy spreadsheet which were then simply increased by  a uniform 300% .  \nWhile I cannot be certain that the August 2016 spreadsheet fuel sales volumes (then \nused by UCE, Veritas and Mr Kaczmarek) were inflated to the same extent, I infer that \nthey probably  were , not least because , if they were not, inconsistencies would have \nbecome apparent to the valuers.  \n1259.  In my view,  Mr Kaczmarek’s evidence on the significance of the different datasets \nwhich were used for the purposes of the UCE, Veritas and BT reports was \nunsatisfactory.    In one of his reports he expressed the  view  that there was no evidence \nthat would lead him to conclude that the volumes upon which he relied were the product \nof an information systems error or of fraud.   He modified this opinion  in his oral \nevidence when he accepted that the differences I have explained led to fundamental \ninconsistencies  which he could no t resolve  or explain , but n onetheless  remained of the \nopinion that Mr B ezant ’s rejection of the data was an overreaction and unjustifie d.

I agree that, i n most  instance s that is the case , but Mr Kaczmarek’s opinion does not \nengage with the gravamen of the point to which he had no answer : the component \nelements of the aggregate d figures  were very different  and he was unable to say that it \nwas appropriate to offset one type of fuel against another for these purposes .  More \nimportantly still, the evidence demonstrating manipulation  by deliberate and unjustified  \nincrease of the volumes above the amounts actually sold  was very strong.   I do not \ntherefore accept that one of the basic datasets for Mr Kaczmarek’s valuation was \nsufficiently reliable for the purpose  for which it was used . \n1261.  In my view, b oth the very substantial size of the unexplained increase and its  uniformity \nreflects deliberate manipulation of the underlying data within BOK . I  consider that  the \nonly explanation for both the increase s applied  and their uniformity  is that the fuel \nvolume data fed to UCE and Veritas by employees within BOK was produced to the \nvaluers without any belief that it reflected the true position, and with  the deliberate \nintention of procuring an increas e in the figure for which those valuers might proper ly \nvalue the petrol stations concerned .  In these circumstances, I find that the fuel sales \nvolumes data provided to UCE, Veritas and BT  was an inaccurate and unsafe  basis for \ndetermining the value of the petrol stations included in the Asset Transfer s. \n1262.  I should also add that, after Mr Bezant’s first report on the value of the petrol stations \nhad been prepared and filed, Mr Kolomoisky disclosed a further set of fuel sales volume \nspreadsheets, which were said to have come from the custodianship of the orig inal \nowners of the petrol stations.  These have been referred to as the IK volume \nspreadsheets and disclosed the same data as that which appears in the August 2016 \nspreadsheet prepared by Mr Chernyshov .  Mr Kaczmarek said they supported his \nconclusion beca use of their source.   To the extent that these were said by Mr \nKolomoisky to support the authenticity of the   August  figures I do not think that they \ndo.  The metadata shows that they were prepared very shortly after the August 2016 \nspreadsheet and there is no documentary or other evidence to indicate that they were \nanything other than a simple copying exercise.  I agree with Mr Akkouh ’s closing \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n312 \n submissions that this conclusion is unaffected by what amounted to no more than \nspeculation that there were any underlying Excel files which verified the data \nindependently from the August 2016 spreadsheet .  In the light of the conclusions I have \nreached as to the true owners of the petrol stations at the time of the Asset Transfer s, \nthe fact that they are said to have emanated from them as custodians after Mr Bezant’s \nasset valuation evidence had been produced does not serve in any way to undermine \nmy conc lusion that the August data on which the reports were prepared was \nmanipulated for the purpose I have just identified.  \n1263.

The Bank must \nestablish that the data used by Mr Bezant is sufficiently solid  to form the foundation for \na reliable DCF valuation , having regard to the fact  that it must show on the  balance of \nprobabilities that the transfer of the petrol stations to the Bank was at an undervalue to \nthe extent of its pleaded case.   The Defendants submitted that the Bank cannot do this .  \nIt said that Mr Kaczmarek’s approach which relied for his DCF valuation on the data \nfrom those reports, provided, together with his  market approach  (to be applied 50/50) , \na more accurate  value.  \n1264.  The Volyn  report was prepared in 2019 for the purposes of restating the bank’s financial \nstatements as at 31 December 2016.  It did not rely on any historical operational data \nbut instead  used data derived from the results of field studies and an estimation of fuel \nsales volumes from comparable petrol stations.  The characteristics of the petrol stations \nbeing valued  were identified by reference to the region in which the petrol station was \nlocated, the number of petrol sta tions located i n that region, the total are a occupied by \nthe petrol station, the traffic flow -throughs and the proximity to main highways.  There \nwas also detail of t he types of fuel sold and the number of tanks on the site.   This was \nall assessed in great detail  and led the Bank to submit that it was  this which enabled \nVolyn to apply the results of their field studies to the particular characteristics of each \npetrol station.  \n1265.  The Defendants mounted a sustained attack on this submission .  They contended that , \ngiven that the results of the Volyn field studies are wholly unknown, the fact that the \ncharacteristics of the petrol st ations to be valued were described by Volyn in great detail \ndoes not assist because there is no means of cross checking how they applied the results \nof the ir field studies or why the data from those studies could properly be regarded as \ncomparable to the likely throughputs for the petrol stations to be valued .  In short, t hey \nchallenged the extent to which  Mr Bezant was himself able to verify the similarities \nwhich the authors had relied on . \n1266.  In response to that challenge , Mr Bezant accepted that the description of the field study \npetrol stations as similar to those which he was va luing relied on third party \nassessments .  He also accepted that he did not ask the Bank if they could ask Volyn to \nprovide their data relating to the field studies and more specifically to the turnover of \nthe similar petrol stations so that the exercise carried out by Volyn could be validated.  \n1267.  As Mr Bezant also accept ed in his evidence, the Volyn report relied on hindsight to \nperform a valuation, because it utilised volumes data from years subsequent to 2016 \nand then rolled back the volumes based on the change in overall regional volumes of \nfuel sold over the interim period.

The difficulty with this second point \nis that it ignores the unreliability of the available data for the actual petrol stations to be \nvalued.  \n1268.  More generally  on hindsight , I think that Mr Bezant was correct to say  that in \ncircumstances in which the contemporaneous underlying data is as unreliable as it is in \nthe present case, it is appropriate to rely on information from after the valuation date so \nlong as it is treated as informative of the position as at the valuation date.  The question \nfrom a valuation perspective is whether the subs equent information on which reliance \nis placed reflects information that would have been available as at the val uation date.   \nIn my view, this approach is consistent both with common sense (see e.g. Bwllfa & \nMerthyr Dare Steam Collieries  v. Pontypridd Waterwork  [1903] AC 426 at 431) and \ncontinues to reflect established principl es of English law (per Popplewell J in Ageas \n(UK) Ltd  v. Kwik -Fit (GN) Ltd  [2014] Bus LR 1338 at [34], who said, in the context of \nassessing damages for breach of cont ract where the valuation date was the date of \nbreach , that there should be no conceptual difficulty in using subsequent events to \ninform an assessment of value at an earlier date in an appropr iate case).  It is also \nconsistent with the basic principle that , where a contingency has occurred between the \ntime of a breach and t he time of assessment, the impact of that contingency can be taken \ninto account .  There was no evidence that Ukrainian law is any different on this point.  \n1269.  A further reason advanced by  Mr Bezant  for using  the Volyn data was its consistency  \nwith figures derived  from two other sources, namely Ukrstat (the national statist ics \nservice of Ukraine) and Naftogaz  (Ukraine’s state -owned oil and gas company ).   \nUkrstat reports on the total number of petrol stations in Ukraine and the volumes of \nboth wholesale and retail sales of light petroleum oil and gas from petrol stations.   Mr \nBezant  analysed sales volume data collected by Ukrstat  for 2015 and 2016 , and then \nworked out an annual implied per petrol station vol ume.  The 2016 figure  for retail sales \n(419 tonnes per year)  came in at slightly below the volume amounts in the Volyn report \n(548 tonnes per year), but  very substantially below the volume amounts used fo r the \npurposes of the UCE reports  (1,333 tonnes per year) .  Even including the figures for \nwholesale  fuel sales , the Ukrstat figure of implied volumes per petrol station was \nsubstantially less than h alf the volume used in the UCE and Veritas report but was \nbroadly equivalent to the volumes used i n the Volyn report.  \n1270.  Mr Kaczmarek’s response was to query the accuracy of the data recording by Ukrstat, \nand said  ‘garbage in, garbage out’, a comment which is obviously true if it really is \n‘garbage in’ , but is no reason to reject the evidence in the absence of anything to \nindicate that misreporting or no n-reporting by enterprise owners to Ukrstat is \ncommonplace.  He accept ed that he had no specific reason to believe that the Ukrstat \nfigures were either reliable  or unreliable , but contend ed that the ir reliability depended \non the willingness of petrol station operators to report their statistics accurately and \ncontinued to assert that they did not justify what he called “wholesale rejection of the \ndata pro vided by the enterprise owners” .

As there is a legal obligation  on petrol station  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n314 \n owners  under Ukrainian law  to report to Ukrstat on a monthly basis, there is no reason \nto consider that their data is unreliable  for the reasons suggested by Mr Kaczmarek , \nwhich in my view were more speculation than evidence .  In light of the conclusions I \nhave reached about the manipulation of the figures within BOK, it is material ly more \nreliable as data from which the actual sales made by the 246 petrol station s can be \ncorroborated t han was the data fed to UCE and Veritas from within BOK.  \n1271.  Mr Bezant  carried out a similar exercise to compare the volume s disclosed in Naftogaz ’ \n2016 annual report which disclosed an implied per petrol station volume for sales by \nUkrnafta, which was c.180 tonnes per year more than the volumes disclosed in the \nVolyn report but c.600 tonnes per annum less than the volumes disclosed in the UCE \nreport .  The Naftogaz 2016 annual report also recorded 2016 fuel sales volume s for the \nPrivat  group of 1,021 petrol stations of which the 246 to be transferred were a subset \namounting to c. 25% of the total .  However, Mr Bezant demonstrated that , if the fuel \nsales volumes (a) disclosed for all the Privat group petrol stations in the Naftogaz annual \nreport and (b) disclosed for the 246 petrol stations transferred as part of the Asset \nTransfers in the UCE and the BT reports were  both accurate, this would have meant \nthat almost all of the Privat group’s fuel sales for 2016 were achieved through the 246 \ntransferred petrol station s and almost nothing was achieved through the remaining 75%.   \nThe Bank was right to describe this result as nonsensical , and in the absence of a \nchallenge to what was recorded in the N aftogaz 2016 annual report is consistent with \nthe Volyn report being based on accurate data, while the UCE and Veritas reports were \nnot. \n1272.  Mr Kolomoisky  challenge d the significance of the data in the Naftogaz  2016 annual \nreport , but only in a limited manner.  It was submitted on his behalf that the data did \nnot include  sales  into the wholesale market  which were said to incorporate what were \ndescribed in the annual report as  ‘corporate sales ’.  It was said that these sales  would or \nmight  cover  that elem ent of  ‘retail sales’ which were achieved through  arrangements \nsuch as block purchases by employers whose employees would then be able to use \ncoupons or cards to acquire the fuel which had already been purchased by their \nemployer .  This suggestion was not explicitly supported by Mr Kaczmarek who was \nunable to say whether or not it had any foundation.  In my view it does not , largely \nbecause the Bank established that  this category of sale is required to be treated as a \nretail sale for  tax purposes, which makes it unlikely that Nafto gaz would then record it \nas wholesale sale for corporate reporting purposes.  \n1273.  Mr Kaczmarek also performed his own reality check .  He calculated the number of \nvehicles a petrol station would have to service per day and per hour in order to sell the \n1,332 tons of fuel per year  reported as having been sold for the UCE report and the 557 \ntonnes of fuel per year reported  as having been sold for the purposes of the Volyn report .  \nHe said that this demonstrated that the UCE report was based on figures which he did \nnot consider to be high perfor"}

It was Mr Bezant’s evidence that he was not \nmeaningfully able to interpret this conclusion .  I understand why  Mr Bezant  took the \nview that he did and consider that Mr Kaczmarek’s cross -check was not of material  \nevidential value .  The assumptions on which it  was based (the size of an average fuel \ntank for a Ukrainian car, the amount refilled at every visit  and the number of hours the \nstation was open)  were speculative . \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n315 \n 1274.  There is little doubt that the data with which each of the experts chose to work was \nunsatisfactory in a number of respects.  However, taking into account  those \ndeficiencies, I am satisfied that, although the fuel volume sales figures utilised by Mr \nBezant  are far from perfect, they are the best available evidence for the petrol station \nturnover as at the time of the Asset Tran sfers.  In particular they are materially more \nreliable than those which were based on the manipulation of the actual figure s which I \nam satisfied took place .  In my judgment they are also  sufficiently accurate to provide \na sound, albeit not conclusive , basis for conducting the DCF valuation which Mr Bezant \nwas instructed to carry out.  \n \nPetrol station valuations: RONIC  \n1275.  The next significant point on which the experts disagreed was RONIC .  As I have \nalready explaine d, this is an acronym for ‘return on new invested capital’ and operates \nas a measure  of the profitability of new capital investments.   As Mr Bezant explained \nit is a computational device to reflect the fact that there are a series of economic forces \nwhich make it hard for companies to make either excess o r ever-increasing returns , in \nother words  returns substantially in excess of the cost  of financing , in the long run .  It \nis of course  predicated on competition in the industry .  In Mr Bezant’s valuation model \nit had an impact of UAH 500 million on his valuation of the petrol stations.   The \nsignificance of this adjustment has to be assessed against the fact that both experts \nagreed that, for the purposes of their DCF valuations of the petrol stations, they could \nbe expected to have achieved a net margin on sales of 10%.  \n1276.  It was Mr Bezant ’s view that,  if a company is achieving a RONIC greater than its cost \nof capital, it s returns will be in excess of those required in light of the risks of the  \nrelevant  investment .  What will then happen is that in the long run competition or \nregulation will act to eliminate or constrain those excess profits.   This therefore requires \nan adjustment to be applied  to reflect additional capital expenditure  which it is \nnecessary to incur over and above the expenditure required simply to maintain the petrol \nstation.  \n1277.  In their joint statement, the experts  agreed that most business es are unable to achieve \nreturns in excess of the costs of capital over an extended period.   In Mr Bezant’s view \nthis principle ought to be applied to the petrol station valuation s.

However, Mr \nKaczmarek said that businesses which depend upon their physical location and first \nmover advantage can sustain excess returns for an extende d period of time  and that this \nis something which all businesses strive to achieve .  In his view these factors would \nallow the petrol  stations to achieve the excess returns which most businesses would not \nmake.  \n1278.  I do not think that the evidence establishes that  physical location or first mover \nadvantage would enable the petrol stations in the present case to achieve excess returns \nthat most businesses would not make .  The Bank established in cross -examination of \nMr Kaczmarek that he had not carried out any analysis comparing  village petrol stations \nwith those on the highway or in a more urban area in order to determine if there was \nany difference between the locations.   He also accepted  that the petrol station mark et in \nUkraine was both mature and competitive.  The evidence is that there are plenty of \ndifferent companies owning and operating petrol stations.   Although  Mr Kaczmarek \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n316 \n insisted that  all businesses that are located in a particular area and physically attached \nto an area will have a first mover advantage as a matter of general economic concept, \nhe did not point to any specific evidence as to how that economic concept might  apply \nin the present case. \n1279.  The consequence of Mr K aczmarek’s position was said to be that the petrol stations \nwere in a position to earn returns in excess of the cost of capital in perpetuity .  He \nsuggested  that, if an existing company in a particular market is servicing the entire \ndemand in a given physical location  and making a return in excess of its cost of capital , \na rational  competitor would not enter and compete in that location .  This was said to be \nbecause the consequence of it doing so would be th at prices and profits would  fall and \nthe demand would be split between the two competitors .  He said  that the position would \nonly be different if an existing entity could not meet the full demand for its services \nwithin a given physical location .  In that situation a competitor might be drawn to enter \nthe market to fulfil the excess demand in circumstances in which it could also make \nprofits in excess of its cost of capital . \n1280.  I found this evidence surprising , because the logical consequence  of what Mr \nKaczmarek had to say was that a potential competitor would never enter the market, \nwhere an incumbent service provider  was satisfying the entire demand, whatever the \nlevel of profit which the existing provider was making .  On the face of it, this is no t \nhow a market economy works , and d espite the challenge which was made to Mr \nBezant’s evidence on this point in cross -examination , I found it more convincing  that \nthe evidence given b y Mr Kaczmarek .  In short , I think that Mr Bezant w as right to say \nthat the reason that the petrol stations were unlikely to be able to maintain returns in \nexcess of the cost of capital in the long term  is that they d id not possess a recognisable \ncompetitive advantage.  They suppl ied what Mr Kaczmarek accepted was a \nhomogenous product  and they d id not have  what Mr Bezant called many of the features \nwhich allow ed them to differentiate themselves from their competition.

Furthermore t he only specific barrier to entry  referred to by Mr Kaczmarek was the \nability of an existing  service provider to lower prices temporarily in order to make a \nnew competitor ’s entry unviable.   That is no more than the consequence  of competition \nin a mature market and does not in my view  affect the underlying question.   It is also \napparent that , despite a recent dip in the market, by 2016 the trend in Ukrainian petrol \nstation  development  was upwards which itself demonstrated that this would be th e right \nway in which to describe this  market.  \n1282.  Mr Kaczmarek also expressed the view that it would be illogical for the petrol stations \nto have to make investments which did not result i n direct economic returns but were \nsimply made in order to stave off competition.   He considered that the only required \ninvestment would be for maintenance.  The Defendants also submitted that the evidence \nshowed a decrease in the number of petrol stations in Ukraine during 2014 -15, and that \nthe evidence did not establish that the market overall was competitive , anyway in the \nsense put forward by Mr Bezant . \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n317 \n 1283.  I do not agree that the evidence established that Mr Bezant made erroneous assumptions \nas to the state of the Ukrainian petrol station market at the time of the Asset  Transfer s.   \nI also accept t he Bank ’s submission that the Defendants’ case was difficult to reconcile \nwith evidence which had been given on behalf of companies beneficially owned by the \nIndividual Defendants in arbitrations  arising out of the expropriation by Russia of \ngroups of petrol stations belonging to Ukrnafta and Stabil (in which Mr Kol omoisky \nhad a beneficial interest) when it annexed Crimea in 201 4 (“the Crimean Arbitrations”) .  \nIn that context it had been  accepted that investment in the petrol stations being valued \nfor th ose purposes was in order to stay ahead of the competition . \n1284.  More significantly, however, Mr Kaczmarek accepted that the normal formula when \ncalculating terminal values or discount rates for a DCF valuation required  RONIC to \nbe set at a figure equal to WACC .  He also accepted that this reflected the fact that \ncompetition will eventuall y eliminate abnormal returns .  However, h is answer to this \nwas that it all presupposed that it was contemplated that new investment was going to \nbe made  and that this was inconsistent with Mr Bezant ’s own assumptions  that the \ngrowth in profits would be  based  on G DP and crude oil price forecasts , which did not \nrequire new investment.   I accept the Bank’s submission that this is not correct.  \nIncreases in GDP are fuelled by new investment while the increase in the price of crude \noil will not of itself lead to equivalent increases in profi t because the experts both made \nassumptions that only 50% of the increase in crude oil prices would be passed onto \nconsumers , with the consequence  that either costs for the business would be increased \ntherefore depressing profitability , or demand will be depressed therefore requiring \nfurther investment to sustain profits.   \n1285.  It follows that in my  opinion the approach taken by Mr Bezant is to be preferred.

The \nunderlying point is that I am satisfied that at the valuation date the petrol station market  \nin Ukraine was both  mature  and competitive.  Mr Bezant’s use of RONIC  to reflect this \nwas just one of the valuation tools which were available to the valuer , and I am satisfied \nthat th e competition which undoubtedly existed was required to be reflected one way \nor another .  In testing the appropriateness of the use of RONIC as a computational \nmeasure , it is relevant to bear in mind that , if the existing petrol stations did not respond \nto potential competition by investing in their businesses , the entry of new competitors \ninto the market was likely to have had the  effect of reducing the achievable net profit \nmargins below the level of 10%  assumed by both of the experts.   Put another way , in \nadopting a 10% net margin model, Mr Be zant assumed an application of RONIC . If \nRONIC  were not to be applied , as Mr Bezant confirmed  in re-examination , the evidence \nis consistent with the need to reduce the net profit margin by an appropriate amount .  \nAs to that there is  some  contemporaneous evidence which would have justified a \nreduction from 10% to 7%.   This would have had a greater impact  on the DCF valuation \nthan the effect of Mr Bezant’s RONIC adjustment.  \n1286.  As to the appropriate a mount of the RONIC adjustment, Mr Bezant’s  DCF valuation  \nhas used a discount rate of  17.5%  for the purpose of discounting future cash flows to 1 \nJuly 2016.   He then added a premium of 1% to the 17.5% cost of capital based on the \nviews of Professor Damodaran to reach a long term RONIC  of 18.5% .  He assumed \nthat there would be four years during the course of which capital expenditure would \nprogressively increase and the RONIC would progressively reduce until the RONIC of \n18.5% would be  reach ed at  the beginning of the  terminal period . I am satisfied that  this \naspect of Mr Bezant’s valuation has been established to be correct.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n318 \n  \nPetrol station valuations: country risk premium  \n1287.  The third disputed factor  is the adjustment required  to the cost of equity calculation in \nthe discount rate methodologies  in order to reflect the incremental risk of the petrol \nstations being located in Ukraine .  This is called the country risk premium or CRP .  It \nis not in issue that some adjustment is appropriate, but the experts d isagree on the level.  \nMr Bezant says that the proper figure is 7.6% while Mr Kaczmarek says that it is 3%. \n1288.  Mr B ezant ’s assessment of the appropriate CRP was based on the sovereign yield \nspread of Ukrainian government bonds in March 2016 as published by Duff & Phelps.   \nMr Kaczmarek  said that this was an artificial starting point and based his CRP  on an \nassessment of currency risk  (in respect of which he assessed the UAH  as being stable  \nwith some but not much exposure  to currency risk ), macroeconomic risk , also known \nas local market risk  (i.e. a risk reflecting the overall health of the economy , which he \nassessed as moderate ) and social risk (which he assessed  having regard to  the petrol \nstations having  no significant labour problems during his projection  period ). \n1289.  In support of his conclusion , Mr B ezant  expressed the view that the petrol stations were \nespecially exposed to country risk because of their immovable , asset -heavy  operations.   \nHe accepted that there were different methodologies  for assessing the appropriate CRP \nbut noted that his conclusion was consistent with (and lower than) the average premium"}

There are \na number of reasons why I have concluded that Mr Bezant’s opinion on this issue is to \nbe preferred.  \n1290.  The first is that , although Mr Kaczmarek agreed that CRP is comprised of six factors \nassociated with doing business in particular countries (namely currency risk, local \nmarket risk, social risk, political risk , regulatory risk  and legal risk ), he only  identified \nthe first three , in their application to Ukraine , as bases for his  conclusion that a CPR of \n3% was appropriate .  He  did not discuss any of the other three in that context .  He cited \nsome academic papers which indicated that, whil e accounting for pol itical risk is \nimportant, simply applying the full sovereign yield spread as a proxy for political risk \ncan lead to what were described as “severely biased” net present value estimates.   \nHowever these citations were general and he did not apply them to the position of \nUkraine as at the relevant time.  \n1291.  Mr Be zant explained in his supplemental report why it was that political risk, regulatory \nrisk and legal risk ought to have been  recognised as CRP components by any valuer \nassessing  the true value of the petrol stations in 2016.  In summary t he risk of conflict \nbetween Ukraine and Russia was high, Ukraine suffered  from a very low level of \nconfidence in the trustworthiness of the Ukrainian judicial system and the judiciary’s \nwillingness to overcome corruption  and the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance \nIndicators indicated that Ukraine’s regulatory quality ranking was low .  In my judgment \nit is clear that each of them was a  risk which ought to have been properly assessed in \nreaching a decision as to the appropriate CRP . \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n319 \n 1292.  Mr Kaczmarek was pressed in cross -examination to explain why he made no reference \nto political risk, regulatory risk and legal risk in what he said was a comprehensive \nanalysis to identify the country risks faced by the petrol stations and quantify their \nimpact.  He accepted that those risks were relevant, but did not accept that the fact that \nhe had made no mention of regulatory risk or legal risk in his report and the fact that \nhis discussion of political risk was generic without application of its impact  in the \nUkrainian context, did not mean that he had not taken those risks into account.   \n1293.  Mr Kaczmarek’s explanation for why his reports  did not discuss those three risks in the \nsame manner that he had discussed currency risk, local market risk and social risk was \nvery difficult to follow. He seemed to be saying that he did not specifically mention \nthem  because they were not unique to petrol stations, but nonetheless they were taken \ninto account in his assessment of the appropriate level of CRP.  In its closing \nsubmissions, the Bank described his oral evidence on this point as “dissembling, \nevasive and totally incoherent”.  I regret to say that I agree with that submission.  \n1294.

In any event , I think that his approach to the appropriate weight to be given to those \nrisks was clearly flawed .  This was apparent from the fact that at that stage it could not \nproperly be said, as Mr Kaczmarek represented that “the risk of an outright war between \nRussia and Ukraine was very remote in most anyone’s estimation” (I was shown a press \nreport to the contrary) .  I also think that he was wrong to characterise the risk of conflict \nbetween Russia and Ukraine not as a political risk but only as a macro-economic risk , \nwhich he said he had taken into account  and that he significantly underplayed the \nwidespread mistrust of the Ukrainian judiciary in 2016 , which was something he said \nthat he would  not be surprised about but had not specifically looked at .  He  said t hat he \nhad more than fully accounted for all of the elements of country risk already in his 3% \nCRP.  \n1295.  The second reason  for concluding that Mr Be zant’s evidence on this point is to be \npreferred  is that Mr Kaczmarek had no coherent explanation for how he reached the 3% \nfigure CRP .  The closest he came to this was to explain that a CRP of 3% resulted in a \ndecrease in the value of the petrol stations of 18% which amounted to 66 days of lost \nrevenue per year . He said that this appropriately captured the level of incremental \ncountry risk faced by the petrol stations , but there was no hard evidence to justify why \nthis was the appropriate figure . \n1296.  In any event, I found  Mr Bezant’s answer to this to be persuasive .  He explained that , \nin order  to assess the sufficiency of such a reduction , it would be necessary to compare \nthe value of an asset in Ukraine with the value of a similar asset in another country . \nWhat Mr Bezant accepted was a very rough and ready way of doing that would be to \ncompare the value of Ukrainian companies to companies in other countries adjusted for \ntheir relative scale (i.e. by comparing valuation multiples ).  His evidence was that the \nmedian multiples of Ukrainian listed companies in 2016 were around 80% to 90% lower \nthan the multiples of companies listed on the FTSE 100.   He correctly accepted that \nthere may be many factors  which explain those differences , but I agree that in broad \nterms it demonstrates that the effect on a company’s value of its location in Ukraine can \nbe very substantial . \n1297.  The third reason is that I was unpersuaded by Mr Kaczmarek’s criticism  of Mr B ezant’s \nuse of the sovereign yield spread as a guide for the assessment of an appropriate CRP .  \nMr Be zant was straightforward in his recognition  of the fact that an assessment of \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n320 \n country risk is not a precise exercise and that the sovereign yield spread does not \nperfectly correlate with it.  However, I think he was correct to say  that it is a very useful \nguide,  which is commonly used as a reference point . I also agree that there is good \nacademic evidence  to justify a conclusion  that it does not give rise to a bias one way or \nthe other when set against other recognised methods of quantifying CRP . \n1298.  Fourthly, I accept Mr Bezant’s evidence that his conclusion s are consistent with other \nCRP assessments.

He has ended up with a lower CRP than the average premium \nadopted by valuers preparing contemporaneous valuation reports of the petrol stations .  \nHis CRP is  also at the lower end of the average figures pro duced by  Duff & Phelps and \nacademics such as Professor Damodaran  and is consistent with an average figure of the \npremia adopted by investment analysts covering large public companies operating in \nUkrain e.  Furthermore in the Crimean Arbitrations , in which Mr Kaczmarek gave \nevidence, a comparison was made between the appropriate CRP for Russia and the \nappropriate CRP for Ukraine calculated on the basis of credit default swap spreads. The \ntribunal appointed expert said that adopting that approach whi le Russia’s CRP was in \nthe vicinity of 2% , the CRP for Ukraine was approximately 8.8% .  Taken together these \nfactors are all strongly corroborative of Mr Bezant’s evidence and undermine that of \nMr Kaczmarek . \n1299.  Fifthly, Mr Kaczmarek’s evidence on this aspect of the case was a clear example of his \ntendency  to unreasoned intransigence on points  when logic led to a conclusion contrary \nto the one he had advanced .  It became increasingly clear  that the figure of 3% was a \nfigure to which he was determined to adhere , notwiths tanding the evidence which \nundermined its appropriateness .  While Mr Bezant  was frank as to the uncertainties in \nthe exercise he was required to carry out,  the same could not be said of Mr Ka czmarek.  \n1300.  In my view, if he had given proper weight to those factors, and I do not think that he \ndid, Mr Kaczmarek would have reached a materially higher CRP figure than 3%.  In \nthese circumstances I find that the best evidence of the appropriate CRP  is to be found \nin the evidence of Mr Bezant.  An adjustment of 7.6%  is required to the cost of equity \ncalculation in the discount rate methodologies in order  to reflect the incremental risk of \nthe petrol stations being located in Ukraine.  \n \nPetrol station valuations: the market approach  \n1301.  The final aspect of the dispute between the experts in relation to the value of the petrol \nstations was the  market approach calculation provided by Mr Kaczmarek . As I \nexplained a little earlier, Mr Kaczmarek based his petrol station valuation as to 50% on \nan income -based DCF analysis and as to 50% on a market approach .  As I have already \nexplain ed, t he Defendants submitted that it was very significant that his market \napproach valuation , which they described as thorough and robust, indicated a figure of \nUAH 8.360 billion , which was comparable in broad terms to his DCF valuation of UAH \n8.527 billion.  The relative equivalence of these two amounts was said to demonstrate \na probability that each figure was likely to reflect a market value or fair value for the \npetrol stations transferred under the Asset Transfer s. \n1302.  I agree that in many cases  there will be  benefit in comparing a market valuation to the \nresults of a DCF valuation .  As Mr Bezant accepted in cross -examination , in principle \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n321 \n a market approach is not an inferior valuation technique to an income approach.  This \nis more particular ly the case if the market valuation is free -standing and is unaffected \nby such deficiencies as there may be in the data avai lable for conducting a DCF \nvaluation.  But it seems to me to be self -evident , as Mr Be zant went on to say , that the \nvalidity of such an exercise depends on the  availability of proper comparables , together \nwith such other inputs as may be required to produce a market val uation which i tself is \nsufficiently robust . \n1303.

Mr Ka czmarek produced two table s of what he contended to be comparable petrol \nstation sales : one for the period 2008 to 2016 and another for  the period 201 7 to 2022.  \nHe also said that in the two years prior to the 31 December 2016 valuation date only 3 \ntransactions yielded an average value per petrol station of less than US$1 million.   Mr \nKaczmarek also referred to the Crimean Arbitration s in which values of 9 times Mr \nBezant’s valuations were awarded in respect of the Ukrnafta petrol stations and 4 times \nhis valuations in respect of the Stabil petrol stations.  \n1304.  Some of these sales were plainly not properly comparable, and I think that Mr \nKaczmarek was wrong to advance them as if they were .  In the event the Defendants \nplaced little reliance on the figures to be derived from them in their closing submissions.  \nThey simply said that the sample of c.940 from which an average price of US$ 1.25 \nmillion per station could be extrapolated was very much closer to the US$ DCF \nvaluation advanced by Mr Kaczmarek (US$ 1.3 million) than it was to the US$ DCF \nvaluation advanced by  Mr Bezant.  \n1305.  In my view , the Defendants were right not to  place much reliance on these comparables.  \nIt became apparent during the course of Mr Kaczmarek’s cross -examination that he did \nnot know the level of throughput of the petrol stations  or where they were located ( city \ncentres or agrarian backwaters) , both of which are  important inputs for valuation \npurposes and likely to have a significant impact on the valuation and market ability of \nthe asset .  It also became clear that in a number of instances, the figures on wh ich Mr \nKaczmarek relied included other ass ets over and above the petrol stations themselves, \nincluding tankers , OSFs and what the Bank called land plots in various stage of \ndevelopment .  He also made no adjustment for the fact that many of the comparables \non which he relied in his report were in countries other than Ukraine , most of which \nwere in the EU .  He refused to accept in his cross -examination that most of the countries \nin respect of which he used comparables in his report were economically and politically \nmore stable than Ukraine , with much lower CRPs .  He also downplayed the significance \nthat some of them ( e.g., Hungary ) had higher population densities and levels of car \nusage  on the basis that these types of consideration s did not indicate  that a petrol station \nwas necessarily going to be worth more in Hungary than in Ukraine.   I did not find his \nanswers on the challenges to these parts of his evidence to be very convincing.  \n1306.  These reason s also featured in Mr Bezant’s evidence as to why the awards made in the \nCrimean Arbitrations were an unhelpful compa rator.  Mr Bezant produced evidence \nwhich illustrated very consid erable differences in the average turnovers of the petrol \nstations operating under the Ukrnafta brand and those operating under the brands \napplicable to the 246 petrol stations transferred under the Asset Transfer s.  There were \na number of specific reasons for this including their location and their condition.

The Bank also relied on the fact that a sensitivity analysis  described in Mr Bezant’s \nreport,  demonstrate d that if the valuations in the Crimean Arbitrations were to be \nadjusted to reflect (i) the devaluation of UAH in 2014 -2016, (ii) the higher fuel volume \nsales in Crimea and (iii) the different CRPs in Russia and Ukraine, the average value \nper petrol station was UAH 9.9  million  (Ukrnafta) and UAH 6.1  million  (Stabil).  As \nthe Bank submitted in its closing submissions “ Those values  bookend Mr Bezant’s \naverage valuation of the Petrol Stations (UAH 7.6m); and are  far lower than Mr \nKaczmarek’s average of UAH 34.3 m.”  I agree that these consideration s reduced the \nextent to which the values reached in the Crimean Arbitrations could properly be treated \nas a robust comparable  without the adjustments put forward by Mr Bezant.  \n1308.  One of those adjustments related to the devaluation of the UAH against the US $ during \nthe period 2014 to 2016.  This is of more general relevance to Mr Kaczmarek’s market \nvaluation and it is necessary to say a little more about it.  Mr Bezant  criticised the \nmanner in which Mr Kaczmarek used his chosen comparables because of  the way in \nwhich he dealt with the impact of the UAH’s depreciation against the US $ over the \nperiod between 2012 and 2016 , with the most substantial  reduction happening during \nthe course  of 2014  and 2015 .  He said that Mr Kaczmarek’s approach distorted the true \nposition and was fundamentally wrong.  This requires a little explanation.  \n1309.  In his presentation of the average price per petrol station achieved in the transactions \nhe used as comparables , Mr Kaczmarek converted the local  transaction prices int o US$ \nusing the exchange rate as at the date of completion .  He then converted them back from \nUS$ to UAH  as at the chosen valuation date ( 31 December 2016 ).  In every case,  if the  \nconversion  from the transaction currency to UAH  had been effected at the date of the \ntransaction , the value of the  petrol stations sold in that transaction  would ha ve been \nsignificantly lower in U AH than the value attributed  to them for comparability purposes  \nby Mr Kaczmarek.  \n1310.  Mr Bezant explained how Mr Kaczmarek's approach  therefore implied that “all else \nconstant, a Ukrainian petrol station can be worth over three times more in UAH in 20 16 \nthan 2013, despite the economic conditions that would have contributed to the extreme \ncurrency  depreciation .”  In his view  this consequence was simply not plaus ible.  If Mr \nBezant ’s approach  of converting  sales prices of the comparable petrol stations to UAH \nat each transaction date  was adopted, the impact would be  to reduce  the weighted \naverage price per station  expressed in UAH  from  UAH 30 million  to UAH 18  million , \nwhich he said was closer to his own DCF assessment of  UAH 8 million than it was to \nMr Kaczmarek’s of UAH  35 million . \n1311.  Mr Bezant also explained how assets might hold their US $ value in a period of UAH \ndepreciation against the US$ if they are capable of being located elsewhere, but where \nthey are immovables such as the petrol stations that cannot occur, depreciation is also \nindicative of  worsening economic conditions which is likely to have an adverse impact \non living standards  and consumer confidence , thereby adversely affecting demand for \npetrol.  \n1312.  Mr Kaczmarek disagreed .  He  said that Mr Bezant had produced no evidence that the \ndevaluation of the UAH between 2012 and 2016  had resulted in a deterioration of the \nUS$ value of Ukrainian petrol station"}

Mr Kaczmarek disagreed .  He  said that Mr Bezant had produced no evidence that the \ndevaluation of the UAH between 2012 and 2016  had resulted in a deterioration of the \nUS$ value of Ukrainian petrol stations .  He said that the primary reason that this would \nnot have happened was that the value of a petrol station is inextricably linked to the \nprice of o il which is incurred in US $.  It followed from this that fuel prices in Ukraine \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n323 \n evolve with foreign exchange rates such that any devaluation in the local currency \nresults in a corresponding increase in U AH denominated petrol product prices  with a \ncorresponding impact on the value of the petrol stations.  \n1313.  Mr Kac zmarek’s evidence therefore assumed that the petrol stations would be able to \npass on the entir ety of their US$-based costs to their customers , thereby increasing not \njust their revenues but also their  profitability  on the basis that they could charge the \nsame percentage markup on their higher revenues .  Mr Bezant said that this was wrong  \nbecause it was unnatural to suppose  that there would be a full pass -on of their rising \ncosts to consumers whose purchasing power would be denominated in UAH .  He said \nthat such evidence as ther e was (derived from the Ukrainian Ministry of Energy and \nCoal) demonstrated  that a pass -through assumption of 50%  is to be expected , meaning \nthat the petrol stations  will themselves absorb  a significant  percentage of the cost \nincrease . This view was corroborated  by a decline in the demand for petrol in Ukraine \nbetween 20 14 and 2016 , which was a period  of significant depreciation  in the value of \nUAH as against the US $.  Demand declined by 11% in 2014  and as much as 27.6%  in \n2015 . \n1314.  I prefer Mr Bezant’s  evidence on this point .  As the Bank put it in its closing \nsubmissions “ In the end this is a simple point. A Ukrainian petrol station generates \n[UAH ] revenues and [UAH ] profits .  Between 2014 and 2016, the Ukrainian economy \nshrank by 8%; demand for petrol fell; and the country was fighting a war against Russia. \nIt is unrealistic to suppose that a petrol station would be three  times more profitable and \ntherefore valuable in 2016 compared to 2014 .” \n1315.  Taken in the round I think that the comparables adopted by Mr Kaczmarek for his \nmarket valuation analysis are far from robust, but leaving aside the averages to be \nderived from his full sample, there was one  comparable on which Mr Kaczmarek and \nthe Defendants placed particular reliance and which merits particular consideration. \nThis was a sale of 240 petrol stations in Ukraine by a Russian company (Lu koil) to \nAMIC Energy in 2014 – 2015  for US$300 million, i.e., an implied price per petrol \nstation of US$1.25 million .  The fact that this  2014/5 transaction included a sale of a \nsimilar number (240) of Ukrainian petrol stations  to the 246  transferred as part of the \nAsset Transfers means that it  is more lik ely to have provided a robust comparable tha n \nthe others included in Mr Kaczmarek’s list .  But on closer analysis there are still serious \nproblems with applying the price achieved to the true value of the 246 petrol stations \nwhich were the subject of the Asset Trans fers. \n1316.  The Lukoil  deal completed after the Russian invasion of Crimea .

They \nsubmitted that this was  an indication that the sale was  analogous to a distressed sale and \nwas unlikely therefore to be overpriced because it would not have  achieved as good a \nprice as a sale in normal market conditions.   However, set against that was Mr Bez ant’s \nevidence that AMIC was a premium brand with average petrol eum vol umes around \n25% higher than the Privat brand to which the 246 petrol stations belonged .  These \nfactors strike me as fairly obvious demonstrations , each in their  own way , of the caution \nwith which a value r should approach their true comparability even though they were all \nlocated in Ukraine . \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n324 \n 1317.  In any event, there are a number of reasons why I consider that reliance on the Lukoil \ntransaction does not give very much  assurance that Mr Kaczmarek’s market valuation \ncan be relied on as a suitable cross -check or as a free -standing valuation of the petrol \nstations at the relevant time.   The first and striking  point is that none of the \ncontemporary valuers (Veritas , UCE  and BT) used a market valuation based on \ncomparables , despite the fact that the Lukoil transaction had completed only a year or \nso earlie r.  This was dismissed in the Defendants’ closing submissions as not relevant , \nbut I think it is .  If it were really to have been the case that  “it is difficult to imagine a \nmore appropriate comparator ” (as it was put in Mr Kolomoisky’s closing submissions ) \nit is to be expected that at least one of the three would have picked it up a nd used it at \nleast as a cross -check.   \n1318.  Secondly the source of the information on which Mr Kaczmarek relied was not very \nscientific , because it came from a short press report of a statement made by the head of \nLukoil ( Vagit Alekperov) which only gave an approximate price for the transactio n.  It \nalso described the  transaction not as a sale  of the petrol stations themselves , but as being \none by Lukoil to AMIC of its 100% stake in Lukoil Ukraine “which owns a network of \n240 stations and 6 depots in Ukraine” .  Whe n the transaction was reported in th e AMIC \nand Lukoil financial statements no price was given . \n1319.  It follows  from this  that it is not possible to tell from the data on which Mr Kaczmarek \nrelied what the impact was on the price per petrol station of the fact that the deal also \nincluded 6 OSFs .  Mr Howard s uggested that the impact was li kely to be “peanuts ”, but \nit is difficult to draw that inference in circumstances in which  Mr Kaczmarek accepted \nthat he had no idea of the size of the OSFs and no way of allocating any value to them .  \nThere is also no way of telling the extent to which the price of the interest in the relevant \ncompany directly reflected the price of its underlying asset s.  I also see force in the \nsubmission that a short press report must rank relatively low in any asse ssment of \nreliability  of the source . \n1320.  Thirdly, the exchange rate point I have already explained may well have been \napplicable.  It is unclear w hether the transaction was denominated in UAH or US $, \nalthough it was referred to in US $ in the press report .

Whichever it was, by the time of \nthe valuation date the US$ value of the deal would  have reduced significantly for the \nreasons I have already explain ed above.   I accept the Defendants ’ submission that this \nconsideration alone would only have reduced the value of each petrol station in the \nLukoil transaction to a figure in the region of US$ 600,00 0 per station, which still shows \na comparable well above Mr Bezant’s DCF valuation .  But that is still much closer to \nMr Bezant’s valuation than Mr Kaczmarek’s and does not take into account the other \npotentially depreciating factors I have already described.  \n1321.  In these circumstances , I consider that the best evidence of the market value of the 246 \npetrol stations transferred as part of the Asset Transfers is the valuation of Mr Bezant \nof UAH 1, 869,327,188  as at 1 September, being the mid -point in time of the Asset  \nTransfer s.  This is very s ubstantially less than that Original 2016 Value  of UAH 6,341 \nmillion attributed to the m in the Bank’s books, which itself was very substantially less \nthan the figure of UAH 8,444 million reached by Mr Kaczmarek .  It follows that , based \non the evidence I have seen , the Original 2016 Value and Mr Kaczmarek’s valuation  \nbear little if any relationship to the true value of these assets.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n325 \n 1322.  It also follows that the amount for which the Bank is required to give credit to the \nDefendants in its claim for the losses which it sustained in consequence of the \nMisappropriation arising out of the transfer of the 246 petrol stations is UAH \n1,869 ,327,118  million.  \n \nAsset Transfers: value of the OSFs  \n1323.  The credit value attributed to the 74 OSFs was UAH 5,891 million  (i.e. their Original \n2016 Value) .  Their Restated 2016 Value , assessed as a result of reports prepared by \nthree different valuers (Asset Expert ise, Expert+ and Volyn)  was UAH 3 25 million.  \nThe value attributed to them by Mr Bezant was UAH 538 million  which was therefore \nvery substantially less than their Original 2016 Value , but materially in excess of their \nRestated 2016 Value .  The value attributed to them by Mr Kaczmarek, was UAH 2,499  \nmillion , which was therefore substantially less their Original 2016 Value but \nsubstan tially more tha n their Restated 2016 Value .  The difference between the parties’ \nrespective valuations was UAH 1,961  million and the amount by which the Bank \nclaimed that their Original 2016 Value  exceeded their true value was UAH 5,353  \nmillion.  \n1324.  Mr Bezant and Mr Kaczmarek were both agreed that it was not possible to  carry out a \nDCF valuation or to  value  the OSFs by reference to valuation multiples derived from \ncomparable companies.   However, they had a fundamental disagreement about the \nalternative methodologies that might be appropriate.  In particular, Mr Kaczmarek \nconsidered that an income approach could be implemented, while Mr Bezant \nconsidered that there was such uncertainty over the operational status of the O SFs in \nthe relevant period that the most appropriate valuation approach was based on the actual \ntransa ction prices achieved at an  auction  of 23 of the OSFs sold in 2019  (further OSFs \nwere sold in 2020, 2021 and 2022) .  \n1325.  The Original 2016 Value of the 74 OSFs was based on  the contents of a report produced \nby BT on 11 April 2016 .

Mr \nKaczmarek  performed a DCF  valuation based on his acceptance  that what he called \n“the capacity and throughput data  of the OSFs ” provided to B T for the purposes of its \n2016 OSF report was accurate.   This was a critical assumption which Mr Bezant was \nunable to accept because  its reliability was too uncertain .  It is clear that , to the extent \nthat there were material inaccuracies in the capacity and throughput data , any DCF \nvaluation based on it would be of little value in attempting to establish a market or fair \nvalue for the OSFs at the relevant time.  \n1326.  The core question to which th e disagreement between the experts gave rise was \ntherefore the quality of the evidence available to the valuers for the purpose of \nestablishing whether the OSFs were operational .  It is the Bank’s case that the figures \nwhich were used by BT for their 2016 OSF report  were not just unreliable but had been \nfalsified within BOK by Mr Chernyshov and Dmitri  Plyska , deputy head of client \nlending in BOK .  Mr Chernyshov was also involved in the manipulation of the data \noriginally used fo r the purposes of valuing the 246 petrol stations , while correspondence \nin relation to the Topchy spreadsheet confirmed that Mr Plyska  worked closely with Mr \nChernyshov  in relation to those valuations .  In the event , Mr Kolomoisky (and b y \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n326 \n adoption the other Defendants ) accepted in his closing submissions that the throughput \ndata given to BT did not appear to have been true, although he went on to  assert through \nhis counsel that he “had no involvement in the provision of, and no knowledge of, the \ndata provided”.   Nonetheless, it remains important to explain my findings as to what \nhappened.  \n1327.  Although t he Original 2016 Value of the 74 OSFs was based on  BT’s 2016  OSF report , \nit is revealing  to consider first the evidence as to how the data for a series of OSF \nvaluation reports produced by BT in 2015 had been compiled .  The copies  of these  \nearlier OSF reports in the trial bundles were all dated 7 August 2015  and were prepared \nin relation to each owner of the 74 OSFs (amongst others) for the benefit of the OS F \nholding entity, the Bank and the NBU .  The purpose of each report  was recorded as a \npledging of the relevant OSFs  to the Bank .  The va luation date  was 1 April 20 15 and \neach report  recorded that it had been provided with data on “the release and residuals \nof petroleum products on a monthly basis ” for the whole of 2014 and the first two \nmonths of 2015 .  The source of the data was said to have been the relevant OSF-owning \nentity.  \n1328.  The precise source of the underlying dat a is not confirmed by any explicit \ncommunication between the Bank and BT, but the  Bank has established that it is very \nlikely to be  a spreadsheet (of which Mr Cher nyshov was custodian) last saved in June \n2015 , which gives monthly volumes for each of the 14 9 OSFs .  The exercise the Bank \ncarried out to show that this was the source  was by comparing  the annual volumes per \nOSF in BT’s 2015 OSF report s to the aggregate of the monthly volumes recorded in the \nJune 2015 spreadsheet .  They matched exactly  and I am satisfied that it is likely that \nthis was the document on which BT relied as its source the relevant data for OSF \nthroughputs when preparing its earlier 2015 OSF  reports.  \n1329.

Equally telling is the result of an exercise ca rried out by the Bank to ascertain the way \nin which the throughput data relating to the seven OSFs which were re corded in the \nMarch 2015 spreadsheet as being operational was manipulated for the purposes of the \nJune 2015 spreadsheet .  Those within BOK responsible for the spreadsheets (most \nlikely to include Mr Chernyshov) carried out  an exercise which echoe d what was done \nwhen the same percentage increases in three categories of fuel were applied month after \nmonth throughout the period January 2014 to February 2015 to the TOPCHII sales \nvolume figures for the same petrol station .  Thus, t he June 2015 version of the OSF \nspreadsheet  recorded a fixed  percentage increase in throughput figures (both inflows \nand outflows) for each of the seven OSFs  which was the same for each of the 14 months \nbetween January 2014 and February 2015  (inclusive), albeit by a different percentage \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n327 \n increase for each of the OSFs.   In my view t his is compelling evidence that the data \nfrom the June 2015 spreadsheet bore little if any resemblance to reality , and was a \nwholly unreliable  source of data from which  BT could have produced a proper DCF \nvaluation.  \n1331.  There were also other discrepancies which cast doubt on the veracity of the June 2015  \nspreadsheet.  Th us, the data included (in a separate table) figures for nominal storage \nvolumes in tonnes for  each OSF.   This volume  was the regulatory capacity figure for \nthe tanks in each OSF, imposed amongst other reasons  to avoid tank overflows.   An \nexercise carried ou t by the Bank demonstrated that , in respect of 35 of the OSFs whose \ndata was recorded in the June 2015 spreadsheets, the recorded opening balance of fuel \nvolume at the beginning of one or more of the months between January  and March 2014  \nexceeded (sometimes by a very significant tonnage) the nominal storage volume for \nthat OSF.   In other words, it was simply not possible for the facility on the relevant site \nto have store d the tonnage of fuel recorded.  This of itself establishe d that the throughput \nfigures for those OSFs cannot have been accurate  and casts significant doubt on the \nreliability of the data used by BT to prepare its  2015 OSF report s.  \n1332.  Having prepared these reports in 2015,  BT were  then further  instructed by the Bank on \n21 December 2015 (with a supplementary instruction on 11 March 2016) to prepare a \nfurther appraisal of the 149 OSFs  with a valuation date of 31 December 2015 , i.e., some \nnine months after the valuation date for BT’s 2015 OSF repo rts.

When  the BT 2016 \nOSF report  was produced, it was dated 11 April 2016 and had 38 annexes grouping \neach of the 149 OSFs by owning entity .  It identified that 70 of the 74 OSFs which were \nthe subject of the Asset Transfers were operating in the sense that it  contained a table \nof throughput data by tonnage for each of them over a period of “ 11 months of 2015 ”. \n1333.  There is no spreadsheet in the trial bundles which evidences the precise source of the \nthroughput figures by OSF, but there is  a spreadsheet in the trial bundles which was last \nmodified by Mr Chernyshov on the same day as the December 2015 instruction was \ngiven  to BT .  It is entitled “Petroleum Storage Depots . March -November 2015 \nPetroleum Products Distribution” .  It has over 6,700 line entr ies, recording the  figures \nfor receipts and distribution at each of the 149 OSF s of four different types of petroleum \nproduct ( A-80, A -92, A -95, Diesel  and a total ) for e ach of the months , March to \nNovember 2015 .  It also marked whether each OSF was operating or not operating.  In \nmarked contrast to what was set out in the table in BT’s 2016 OSF report, only four of \nthe 74 OSFs which were the subject of the Asset Transfers were marked as operating .  \nThe remaining 70 were marked as no t-operati ng and w ith one single exception (diesel \ndistributed from the Brilevka OSF in September 2015)  disclosed a zero figure for \ndistribution throughout the period.  \n1334.  The data in this spreadsheet was far more consistent with the March 2015 spreadsheet \nwhich I have found to have been manipulated for the purposes of the BT 2015 OS F \nreports than it was to the data which was eventually used for the purposes of sh owing \nthat 70 of the 74 OSFs were operating  for the purposes of BT’s 20 16 OSF report .  \nIndeed, t here were  striking similarities between what seems to have been done with the \nthroughput data for OSFs and the manipulation of the data for the 246 petrol stations.   \nThe Bank submit ted that it is to be inferred that this clearly demonstrated that BT had \nbeen provided with inaccurate data by the Bank which had been  made up by individuals \nwithin BOK and then inserted in the data sheets eventually used by BT for its OSF \nvaluation s.     \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n328 \n 1335.  The possibility of some form of manipulation seems to have been suspected by BT at \nthe time , even though they did not know what it was .  Thus, shortly after  it received the \nsupplementary instruction, B T wrote to  the Bank asking it to provide written \nclarification regarding the oil products sales volumes of the OSFs .  BT said that it \nrequired this information because a number of OSFs  had been identified where \npetroleum products sales volumes significantly exceed ed average industry indicators.   \nBT then went on to express concerns that this might have been caused by double \ncounting.   This then led to the following request  in a Skype  exchange  between  Mr \nPlyska and Mr Chernyshov  concerned with how to respond to BT’s question , which \ngives a clear indication that individuals within BOK were prepared to invent  reasons \nfor what appeared on their face to be improbabilities in the extent of OSF turnover : \n“There is a question from Bakers in the mail, please write that this is happening \nbecause these oil storage facilities are making do not sell through the petrol station \nretail chain, but sell to major wholesale buyers (a"}

BT continued to express concerns, because 3 days later (on 21 March 2016 ) it wrote \nagain to the Bank explaining  that its internal technical control had identified a number \nof issues relating primarily to the source data with which it had been provided, the use \nof which may lead to what it called a “non -objective assessment ”.  BT explained that a \nnon-objective assessment is an assessment that is based on knowingly false data .  It said \nthat, where that is the case , the assessor is required to ask its customer for comments , \nand if the customer is unable to comment or to confirm  information that may be biassed \nor untrue, the assessor must refuse to perform the work . \n1337.  The issues on which it expressed concern  can be summarised as follows:  \ni) An analysis  of the total tran sshipment volumes  of petroleum products in Ukraine \nfor 2014 demonstrated  that the national total was 7.66 million tonnes  of which \n5.65 million tonnes  passed through oil bases outside the Privat  group (i.e., other \nthan the 149 OSFs).  This left a maximum possible figure of 2 million  tonnes \nfor the 149 OSFs.  The data which had been provided  to BT claimed that the \nthroughput for the 149 OSFs was in fact 5 million tonnes . \nii) The fuel transshipment volumes for a number of the OSFs significantly \nexceeded the volume of the tank farm , in some instances by very subst antial \npercentages indeed .  This was  similar to one of the point s which ha s been \nidentified by the Bank in relation  to BT’s 2015 OSF reports . \niii) Two examples were given to illustrate BT’s concern that data from Ukrainian \nrailways demons trated that the volume of petroleum products from rail transport \nin 2014 for some OSFs  did not correspond to the volume specified in the data \nsupplied by the Bank.  \n1338.  BT then asked that the following be done “i n order to address the risks associated with \nsource data ”:  \n“1. Please promptly check/recheck the source data provided on the transshipment \nvolumes for all oil bases, and confirm them with the source documents (associate \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n329 \n the data of fuel accounting logs with the source transport documents).   Provide us \nwith transhipment information and copies of source documents confirming the \nspecified transshipment volumes for working documents.  \n2. To provide an information response on the technical condition of the oil bases \nwith the indication of primary information sources, which will be sufficient \njustification of the possibility to perform their activities for the main purpose of \ntransshipmen t and storage of petroleum products.  \nPlease note that these facts and information request points are critical to the \ncompletion of work to address  the project risks associated with the reliability of the \nsource data. ” \n1339.  The evidence does not disclose what happened next , but whatever it was must have \nsatisfied BT that it was able to proceed and complete its work , because its 2016 OSF \nreport was produced 3 weeks later on 11 April 2016 .

The evidence does not disclose what happened next , but whatever it was must have \nsatisfied BT that it was able to proceed and complete its work , because its 2016 OSF \nreport was produced 3 weeks later on 11 April 2016 .  As well as  the capacity and \ndespatch tonnage f or each of the 149 OSFs I have described in paragraph s 1331  and \n1332  above , the report described  the technical condition of each of them as being either \nsatisfactory or good .  The report  stipulated that it was produced solely f or the internal \nuse of the Bank and r estrictions on its use were provided for by the “Technical \nAssignment and the conclusion about the value”.   It was to be  solely for the internal use \nof the Bank and was “not intended to be transferred to any third parties, including, but \nnot limited to, state organisations, regulatory authorities, financial institutions or \nclients” of the Bank.  It also listed under “Restrictions”  that BT did not conduct a \npersonal re view of the OSFs  and that in its conclusions and opinions on the condition \nof the OSFs , based itself only on t he information provided by the Bank . \n1340.  BT’s 2016 OSF report then set out a series of assumptions on which its conclusions \nwere based.  These assumptions set out an extensive series of qualifications as to the \nnature of the task which BT carried out .  In particular BT made a series of generally \napplicable assumptions  that all documents and information, including oral information, \nprovided by the Bank or  the relevant OSF -owning company was deemed to be accurate \nand stated that BT  “did not conduct legal expert review, inventory,  construction and \ntechnical review of the assets and related property right s;”.  It was also assumed that \nthe OSFs had no defects affecting their value except for those described in the report .  \nThe report also identified a series of special assumptions  which appear to have been \nspecifically necessitated  by th e particular task  of valuing the 149 OSFs .  These included \nthe unsurprising  assumptions that each OSF was managed by an effective operator  and \nthat the tanks complied with all technological requirements and regulations for the \nstorage of fuels . \n1341.  More significantly, however, BT  included in their 2016 OSF report, the following two \nspecial assumptions , more in the form of limitations on the work they had been able to \ncarry out : \ni) BT “did not verify the compliance of market demand and consumption of actual \ndata on fuel transfer provided by the Customer and proceeds only from the \nTechnical Assignment ”; and \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n330 \n ii) BT reiterated that it  “did not conduct a personal review of the Subject Property \nand believes that the Subject Property is in working condition and that the \npetroleum tank farms themselves work in their own working mode as intended. ” \n1342.  The reference to the Technical Assignment is itself an important qualification to the \nnature of BT’s 2016 OSF report, which was made clear in its description of the \nEvaluation Base on which it had proceeded .  This part of the repor t stated as follows:  \n“According to the terms of the Technical Assignment and the contract, the appraisal \nbase is the appraised value, which is a non -market base  … As part of the Appraisal, \nthe Customer establishes specific requirements for the Report and cost \ndetermination procedures, which do not reflect the general market principles of cost \nformation, in the form of a Technical Assignment.”  \n1343.  The report then included a table which included a clear statement that the sales volumes  \nwere issued by the Bank and “were not checked for compliance with the market due to \nthe lack  of statistics on petroleum tank farms”.  It then explained the consequence of \nthese limitations on BT’s wo"}
{"start": 1242500, "text": "r establishes specific requirements for the Report and cost \ndetermination procedures, which do not reflect the general market principles of cost \nformation, in the form of a Technical Assignment.”  \n1343.  The report then included a table which included a clear statement that the sales volumes  \nwere issued by the Bank and “were not checked for compliance with the market due to \nthe lack  of statistics on petroleum tank farms”.  It then explained the consequence of \nthese limitations on BT’s work in the following terms:  \n“Thus, the Technical Assignment is intended to conduct an appraisal in accordance \nwith the specific conditions established by the Customer, which are not market -\nbased. This applies, first of all, to the appraisal model and sales volumes, which in \nturn are t he most sensitive parameters in relation to the value of the Assets. The \nexpert did not conduct a special check of the market demand and the possibility of \nselling on the market the volume of fuel specified by the Customer in the Technical \nAssignment and cannot assert that a potential buyer, if he wishes to conduct a \nmarket transaction for the acquisition of a petroleum tank farm, will not lay down \nother sales forecasts and use a different business management model. So, the value \ndetermined in the report d oes not take into account the most efficient use of the \nAssets and in no case can be considered as market value, but is only an \ninterpretation of the Technical Assignment established by the Customer.  \nThe methods for establishing the appraised value in accordance with the Technical \nAssignment also do not correspond to other appraisal bases, namely: depreciated \nreplacement (reproduction) value, value in use, liquidation value and residual \nvalue. ” \n1344.  This made quite clear that , because the Bank had established specific requirements for \nthe report  which did not reflect general market principles, the report did not reflect \nmarket value , but was simply to be treated as an interpretation of the technical \nassignment established by the  Bank.   On the face of it , the level of qualification to the \naccuracy of the underlying data used for BT’s 2016 OSF report made it an unsuitable \nstarting point for any valuation , which seems to have been the reason for which BT so \nheavily qualified the report in the first place.  In these circumstances , I do not accept \nthe submission made on behalf of Mr Kolomoisky  that because BT provided the Bank \nwith the report on which Mr Kaczmarek relied, they “must have been satisfied that it \nwas reasonable” , anyway for the purposes for which Mr Kaczmarek relied on it .  Far \nfrom it, BT made  quite clear  that the inad equacies in the ir underlying data (on which \nMr Kaczmarek later relied ) were such that a reliable market value of the OSFs could \nnot be based upon it.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n331 \n 1345.  As I have explain ed earlier in this judgment (see paragraph 514 above), the concerns \nabout the reliability of the underlying data were confirmed by what occurred after the \nreport h ad been made available to the NBU , whose initial response was that the \nqualification s included by BT meant that it could not be used for the purpose for which \nit had been produced .  Ms Rozhkova explained that the NBU had not objected to the \nappointment of BT as an internationally recognised firm, but said that the appointment \nproved to have been made on what she called a clearly inappropriate basis. The NBU  \nalso made clear that , because the report was design ated exclusively for the Bank’s \ninternal use and could not be used by “state organizations, regulatory authorities, \nfinancial institutions and Customer’s clients” , a new assessment would be required if \nthe NBU were to be able to rely on it.  \n1346.

By the end of June 2016, t he NBU had determined that it needed to carry out its own  \ninspection of a selection of the OSFs referred to in BT’s 2016 OSF report .  The results \nof that inspection were (as Ms Rozhkova explained in her evidence) that the concerns \nthe NBU already had about the robustness of the BT report proved to have been well-\nfounded.   In particular the inspections of more than 20 of the OSFs demonstrated that \nseveral of them had not been working for a long period of time .  Indeed Ms Ro zhkova \nsaid that some of them were found to have been in ruins.  This led to an explanation \ndrafted by Ms Koryak and Mr Plyska , both working within BOK,  in which they gave \nthe following explanation  for why a number of the OSFs appeared to have been \ninoperative : \n“Prolonged downtime of the tested real estate is primarily due to organisational \nconditions, namely transfer of ownership of real property units during mortgagor \nsubstitution, pre -trial foreclosure by the bank, registration of financial leasing. \nAccordingly , it was difficult to ensure business operations and solve administrative \nand managerial issues for a long time. Social security of employees due to \nsuspending work of enterprises was partly decided by employers through \nestablishing part -time. Incomplete working hours amounted to the agreed number \nof hours per week. We also pay special attention to the fact that the abnormal high \nair temperature occurred in the territory of Ukraine and therefore the petroleum \ntank farms were forced to shorter the day -light working hours in order to reduce \nthe fire hazard, works for acceptance and shipment of petroleum products were \ncarried out at night. Night work is also due to high traffic intensity of long -distance \nstate routes during the day and the requirements for the  transportation of petroleum \nproducts. ” \n1347.  This explanation  bore the appearance of having been made up .  Ms Rozhkova  gave \nevidence  that, at a meeting with Mr Kolomoisky  on 7 July 2016 , which was also \nattended by Ms Gontareva,  she reiterated to him that the NBU was serious about the \nreal need for the Bank to restore its capital position to acceptable levels, and  that she \nremained of the view th at the overvaluation was not accidental .  At that meeting , the \nNBU presented documentation including a  table which demonstrated that of the 33 \nOSFs which had by then been checked by the NBU, only 7 were operating  and that the \nmajority had not been functional for a long time (by which was meant 5 to 6 years).  \nThe table confirmed that for the NBU’s purposes it was not possible for any value to \nbe attributed to them because their value was inflated and did not correspond to market \nvalue, B T having proceeded on the basis that they were functional.   It was shortly \nthereafter that Mr Kolomoisky gave the personal undertakings that I have already \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n332 \n described in paragraph 517 above.   At about the same  (on 6 July 2016) , Mr Bogolyubov \nwas given the warn ing by Evgeniy R uvinsk iy I have already described in paragraph \n509 above.  \n1348.  The next thing that happened was that the NBU ( jointly with the Bank) commissioned \na further valuation report of 36 of the OSFs , which had by then been taken onto the \nBank’s balance sheet,  from Veritas .  Th is report was produced on 18 August 2016 and \nvalued the 36 OSFs  as at 30 June 2016 .

Th is report was produced on 18 August 2016 and \nvalued the 36 OSFs  as at 30 June 2016 .  The market value was said to be UAH 1.314 \nbillion,  a figure which was 42% less than the valuation given for the same OSFs in BT’s \n2016 OSF report  (UAH 2.2 billion) .  In reaching that figure, there are a number of  \nsignificant discrepancies as against  the data recorded by BT.  Thus, Veritas described \nonly five as being operational, while , in BT’s 2016 OSF report, 34 of the same 36 were \nsaid to have throughput volumes (i.e., tonnage desp atched during the applicable 11 \nmonths of 2015) which indicated that th ey were in active working order .  It also appears \nthat the tonnage capacity figures which should have been the same in both the BT 2016 \nOSF report and the Veritas report were recorded as materially different  in the two \nreports (in each instance a smaller capacity was disclosed in the Veritas repor t).  \n1349.  The Bank submitted that there  is good  reason to think that even t he Veritas figures for \nthe 36 OSFs it valued were based on ov er-optimistic assumptions as to their operational \nstatus .  Thus, it pointed out that a  column on the relevant table describing the \noperat ional status of the 31 currently non -operational OSFs indicated that they were all \n“ready to operate ”.  I agree that t his is difficult to square with the evidence obtained by \nthe NBU when it carried out its own inspections at the beginning of July 2016 . \n1350.  It is also difficult to square with  inspections carried out by officers from a number of \ndifferent Bank branches subsequent to the time of its  nationalisation.  During the course \nof March 2017 , 52 OSFs were inspected of which only one was said to be operational \nand one was said to have been potentially operating.  The remainder were described as \nnot functioning or not operated .  Of itself, this does not establish that they were no t \noperati ng at the time of the original valuations carried out by BT or V eritas, but in \nrelation to many of them the detailed descriptions given in the inspection reports are \nonly consistent with a  conclusion that the period for which this had been the ir condition \nand status  had often been many years . \n1351.  The most extreme example was an OSF in Poltava Region , which was valued by BT in \nits 2016 OS F report at UAH 149 million on the basis of a 2015 despatch volume of \n75,102 tons and a condition recorded as satisfactory .  Its true status  was recorded in the \nrelevant 2017 Bank inspection report as having been out of operation  for over 23 years \nand being in the following condition:  \n“There is only a watchman on the territory. The facility is not in a satisfactory \ncondition, the sheds where the petrol trucks were stored are dilapidated (the roof \nhas fallen off, trees and bushes are growing in the middle). Pumping station - all \npumps an d gearboxes have been dismantled, and some pipes are missing.

In his oral evidence , Mr Kaczmarek  initially continued to  maintain  the view he had \nexpressed in his reports to the effect that the operational data on which BT had based \nits 2016 OSF report was reliable .  He said that  operating status was established if an \nOSF was simply storing fuel for customers, but accepted that he had no basis for \nconcluding that this is what any of them were in fact doing , and had no real answer  to \nthe point that his valuation like BT’s was based on throughput not storage .  \nFurthermor e, as he was taken through the underlying materials I have described above, \nhe accepted that BT had made clear that they had not verified any of the data on demand \nand consumption , which meant that they had not be able to verify the throughput figures \nwhich they had derived from the individuals at BOK acting for the Bank . \n1353.  Mr Kaczmarek also said that one particular  reason he considered that the OSFs were \nlikely to have bee n operation al was because that was the status of the petrol stations .  \nIn summary h e said that, as a matter of what he called logical necessity and economic \nrationality , it was more reasonable to assume that the OSFs  which were the subject \nmatter of the Asset Transfers were operational rather than non -operational , given that \nthe 246 petrol stations required  intermediate storage facilities . \n1354.  This argument had a superficial attraction , but in the event it did not st and up to scrutiny , \nbecause the OSFs and the petrol stations were geographically dispersed and there was \nno evidence that the 246 petrol stations in fact relied on the OSFs for supplies .  In other \nwords there was no evidence that the OSFs and the petrol stations  were vertically \nintegrated trading enterprises .  Furthermore, Mr Kaczmarek accepted that a very much \nsmaller number of OSFs (even as few as five ) might have been sufficient to  service the \n246 petrol stations .  It was also the case that n o exercise had in any event been done to \nestablish the extent to which the 246 petrol station s in fact  required the service of an \nintermediate storage facility in the form of an OSF , whether because of the extent of \ntheir own on site storage being resupplied from the refinery at Poltava or otherwise .  In \nthese circumstances , I do not think that Mr Kaczmarek’s argument  based on logical \nnecessity and economic reality had any sufficient evidential foundation , and it certainly \ndoes not undermine the more compelling evidence of the non -operational status of the \nOSFs which I have already described and which I find to have been a more accurate \nreflection of the true position.  \n1355.  Mr Kaczmarek also said that he never used the term ‘Special Assumption ’, which as I \nhave already explained had real significance to BT’s 2016 OSF reports , because of the \nqualifications which it conveyed .  Initially he said that he did not know what was meant  \nby this phrase .  This was surprising  evidence  because the way the phrase was presented  \nby BT indicated that it had  a technical meaning , as indeed  it does  in the IVS Definitions.  \nIt means  \"... an assumption that either assumes facts that  differ from the  actual facts \nexisting at the valuation  date or that would not be made by a typical market  participant \nin a transaction on the valuation date.\"   Mr Kaczmarek then  suggested that BT may not \nhave been using the phrase in its technical sense .

But in any event it was \nobvious from  the substance of  what BT was saying that they were very unhappy with \nwhat they were being told about the underlying data  and I found it surprising that Mr \nKaczmarek did not seem to recognise that was the case . \n1356.  By the end of his cross -examination, Mr Kaczmarek had been driven to accept that it \nwas not accurate for him to have said, as he did in his initial report , that there was no \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n334 \n reason to doubt that the OSFs valued by BT in its 2016 OSF report were operational .  \nHe explained that he still thought that this was an accurate thing for him to have said \non the basis of the information know n to him at the time , but I am afraid that the \nreluctance with which he acknowledged that the evidence advanced by the Bank was \ninconsistent with this belief, undermined the extent to which I was able to treat his \nevidence as  genuinely independent . \n1357.  In my view , the evidence taken as a whole gave  overwhelming support to the Bank’s \ncase that a very substantial proportion of the 70 OSFs , which were said in BT ’s 2016 \nOSF report to have been operating with substantial volume s of throughput , were not in \nfact operational at all and, to the extent that they were operational, the throughput \nfigures were fabricated.   I have formed the clear view that the underlying data was a \nwholly unreliable foundation for the DCF valuation of the OSFs conducted by Mr \nKaczmarek.   As I have already explain ed, the Defendants go some  way towards \nacknowledging that is the case by their acceptance that the throughput  data given to BT \ndoes not appear to have been true.  \n1358.  The Bank also crit icised some of Mr Kaczmarek’s  other  assumptions  when making his \nDCF valuation.  They related  to EBITDA margins and capital expenditure , the \nappropriateness of his CRP and the absence of a RONIC adjustm ent.  The EBITDA \nmargins and capital expenditure assumptions were based on Mr Kaczmarek’s evidence \nin the Crimean Arbitration s and the Bank’s  criticisms w ere based on the inability to \nmake a proper comparison between  the OSFs which were in issue in those proceedings  \nand the 74 OSFs which formed the part of the Asset Transfer s.  Its criticism s of the \nlatter two assumptions w ere based on similar submission s to those made  in relation to \nMr Kaczmarek’s  valuation of the 246 petrol stations.   I have decided that in light of the \nfundamental flaws in Mr Kaczmarek ’s use of the underlying operational dat a, there is \nlittle purpose in  exploring these criticisms in more detail, not least because neither party \ndeveloped their submis sions  on any of these points . \n1359.  Of greater  potential significance was Mr Kaczmarek’s evidence in relation to what can \nbe characterised  as four cross checks to his DCF valuation s.  In Mr Bezant’s view, they \nwere of limited utility because they all  reflected the value of OSFs which were \noperational .  This is certainly the cas e in relation to the first of these cross checks , which  \ninvolved a comparison of what Mr Kaczmarek said was his implied multiple of 8.1 \nbased on the OSF’s projected EBITDA of US$10.8 million , with an industry average \nEV/EBITDA multiple of 10.5 in 2016 for the oil /gas distribution sector , based on the \nwork of Professor Damodaran.

The problem with this cross -check was that its utility \ndepends on the figures for BT throughput which I have concluded are wholly unreliable .  \nIndeed, in  the course of his cross -examination Mr Kaczmarek accepted  that, if the BT \nthroughput figure were wrong, there were no earnings that could properly be included \nin his DCF calculation with the consequence that this cross -check did not work.  \n1360.  The second cross check was Mr Kaczmarek’s  evidence that the average per -OSF value \nof US$1.2 1 million was consistent with  the range he had previously calculated when  \nvaluing oil storage facilities in the Crimean Arbitrations, where he had come up with \nan approximate value of US$1.17 million per facility.   The way that this evidence was \ngiven was very surprising because , although it was accurate in so far as it we nt, it gave \na very misleading impression.   The reason for this is th at he failed to go on and disclose \nthat the  arbitration  tribunal did not accept his evidence on this point ; it rejected his \napproximate value of US$1.17 million per facility and instead awarded  US$871,000 \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n335 \n for each of the two facilities he had valued (i.e., more than 25% less).  At the time he \nsubmitted his report on this point in these proceedings, the arbitration award had been \nmade , Mr Kaczmarek had read it, but it was not  publicly available .  His explanation for \nhis omission to disclose what was plainly a relevant fact was  that he did not agree with \nthe tribunal’s ultimate decision.    \n1361.  I do not regard that explanation as at all satisfactory in light of  the fact both that Mr \nKaczmarek  was advancing his own evidence as an appropriate and objectively credible \ncross -check and that other parts of his report in relation to the petrol stations did refer \nto the award itself rather than merely his own eviden ce.  His original evidence  gave the \nimpression that there was only a difference of less than 4% between the current  \nvaluation  and the chosen comparable , whereas on the tribunal’s findings the d ifferential \nwas in fact 28%.  I also think that the way he dealt with his cross -examination on this \npoint demonstrated a misunderstanding of his duty to have regard to all material facts \nincluding those which might detract from his opinion .  This of itself undermined my \nconfidence in his ability to appreciate the nature and extent of his duty as an \nindependent expert to assist the court . \n1362.  Mr Kaczmarek’s  third cross check was that he noted that BT had used what he called \nthe comparable transaction approach when valuing two assets for which no throughput \ndata was provided .  He said that BT had determined (by reference to five comparables) \nthat buyers of comp arable assets could be expected to pay US$136 per tonne of storage \ntank capacity , that 72 of the OSFs had a total capacity of 522,775 tonnes and that th is \ntherefore implied an aggregate value of US$71 .1 million  which was within 18% of the \nfair value he reached using his DCF approach .  Although advanced as a cross -check by \nMr Kaczmarek, it was then put forward in submissions on behalf of Mr Kolomoisky as \nan alternative valuation basis in its own right.  \n1363.  This figure of US$136 per tonne of storage  capacity , derived  as it was from the five \ncomparables , assumed that the characteristics of the OSF to which the comparables  \nwere to be applied included a  locat ion in Kyiv,  accessib ility by railway and  a storage \nvolume of 9,000 tonnes .

These characteristics  did not therefore bear very much \nsimilarity to the 74 OSFs.  In short, US$136 per tonne was calculated as  the median in \na range for the five comparables  used, but , as Mr Kaczmarek accepted,  without any \nadjustme nts to recognise the differ ences . \n1364.  Quite apart from the impact of the fact that the comparables being used assumed a \nnotional 9,000 tonne facility in Kyiv  with railway tracks available , I agree with the \nBank that t he difficulty with this analysis is that the basic information on which BT \nbased its comparables was limited .  A s Mr Kaczmarek accepted , there was no \ninformation on whether or not they were operational and if they were not , whether work \nwas required to put them into an operational state.   There was also no data on their \nthroughput and it appears from other evidence that the o ffer prices described for each \nof the five comparables  were in fact sales listings of assets which had been on the \nmarket for more than a year  and do not appear to have led to a conclud ed transaction.  \nIn his evidence, Mr Bezant summarise d the position as follows:  \n“this is a set of five offers that never resulted in an actual transaction price and so, \nto that extent, notwithstanding that Baker Tilly is trying to allow for that, they’re \nnot actual transaction data, they’re guide prices. I would say that there’s five of \nthem. They hadn’t sold in the last year or so, based on an earlier report. I would say \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n336 \n that you then need to take the median and, as I said, re - perform this exercise -- and \nthis is what Baker Tilly do, I think -- for each of the other subject assets to \nrecalibrate. The median is as applies to Kyiv. It’s not as applies to all of the other \nsubject assets where you have to go through the same exercise. So that’s what you \nwould need to do rather than use the 136.”  \n1365.  Furthermore, in applying the figure of US$136 per tonne capacity to the OSFs , Mr \nKaczmarek made no allowance for any differences in the condition of the particular \nOSF to which it was being applied.   It seems to me that, on that ground alone, the cross \ncheck is not very robust, even less so if it is being used as an alternative valuation basis \nin its own right .  In my judgment, the problems with the data in relation to condition \nare so wide ranging that Mr Kolomoisky was wrong to submit that the US$136 per \ntonne storage capacity provided a reasonable basis  for an approximate value of the \nOSFs as a set.  In particular the evidence does not justify a finding that, because some \nof the OSFs will be more v aluable than the average and some less so,  the US$136 per \ntonne capacity  figure will give  a relatively robust indication of the overall value of the \nOSFs.  \n1366.  Veritas carried out a similar exercise in its June 2016 report and appears to have come \nup with numbers in relation to the seven facilities it looked at which were said by the \nDefendants  to support the ir submiss ion that BT’s comparables figure of US$136 per \ntonne was not unrea sonable .  This was not relied on by Mr Kaczmarek in his report and \nfor that reason alone is of no real assistance .  However, on the face of it, the use of these \nparticular facilities  as comparables  suffe rs from some of the same problems as those I \nhave identified in relation to the BT comparables.

Indeed, the wide range of offer \nvalues per tonne (with the lowest at US$75 per tonne and the highest at US$ 259 per \ntonne ) demonstrates the extent to which location, conditio n, size and  nature of the \nfacility can have a significant impact on the right figure.  \n1367.  In his cross -examination, Mr Kaczmarek accepted that it was appropriate to eliminate \nhis fourth  cross -check , although he said that it remained something which he felt it was \nfair to point out.  The starting point was that the figure of UAH 2 .370 billion which he \narrived at for the OSFs was 58% lower than the figure of UAH 5.685 billion figure  for \ntheir Original 2016 Value .  In his report he said that this was comparable to a 52% \ndownward adjustment made  by EY in a pre-nationalisation audit status report dated 22 \nNovember 2016.  \n1368.  The EY exercise had  involved (amongst other exercises) a desktop review of the fair \nvalue of 391 collateral and intangible assets held by the Bank  including 119 OSFs .  \nHowever EY in fact referred to an adjustment of  between  UAH 1.28 billion and UAH \n4.38 billion , amounting to a substantial range of 50% to 85% .  It is therefore obvious \nthat an adjustment anyway in the upper end of EY’s range gives little comfort that Mr \nKaczmarek’s 58% reduction in the OSFs’ Original 2016 Value was sufficient or \nappropriate.  \n1369.  Before dealing with  Mr Bezant’s approac h, it is appropriate to explain the  conclusions \nof the valuers (Asset Expertise, Expert+ and Volyn) who were instructed in 2018 to \nvalue the OSFs in the context of the Bank’s need to restate its 2016 accounts .  They \nassessed their total value as being UAH 325 million , a figure which is obviously \ndramatically different from the figure of UAH 5,891 million attributed to them as their \nOriginal 2016 V alue based on the report produced by BT .  The valuers instructed for \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n337 \n the restatement were able to conduct site inspection s of some of the  OSFs  and they \nrecorded that  71 of the 74 they valued were n on operational .  Of those, most  were \ndescribed  as capable o f being returned to operation with remedial expe nditure  and the \nremainder  were described as derelict.  \n1370.  Against the background of the re being insufficient comparables to adopt a market \nvaluation (which both experts agreed was the case) and the lack of reliable data on the \nOSFs ’ operation al status sufficient to conduct a DCF valuat ion, Mr Bezant’s approach \nwas to value the OSFs by reference to the price of a subset of 55 OSFs which were \nactually sold at auction during the course of the period 2019  to 2021 (23 in 2019, 19 in \n2020 /21 and 13 in 2021 /22).  It was his evidence, with which I agree,  that it is \nreasonable to assume that the result of each auction reflect ed the market value of each \nOSF as at the date of sale.  In this context, his evidence was that the bidding for each \nauction began at an initial starting price, suggesting that the seller was motivated, at \nleast in part, to secure a reasonable price , rather than simply seeking a quick sale;  that \nsome auctions contained multiple participants, making multiple bids, indicating a n \nactive market; and that t he auctions were spread over several years (between July 2019 \nand October 2021), suggesting that the OSFs were not sold with undue urgency.  \n1371.

The total realisations from the  auction sales of these 55 OSFs over the period 2019 to \n2021 was UAH 157 million, which compares to  Original 2016 OSF Value s attributed \nto the same 55 OSFs  at the time of the Asset Transfers totalling UAH 3,389 million .  \nMr Bezant’s essential initial approach was then to calculate an appropriate figure for \nthe median price per unit capacity multiple implied by these auction sales , so that this \nfigure  could  then be applied to th ose OSFs for which auction data was not available . \nHowever , he was concerned about the possible impact of the Covid -19 pandemic on \nthe prices achieved at auctions  in 2020 and 2021 , and considered that it was therefore \nappropriate to use only the 23 auction sales achieved in 2019  as his base data .  They \nwere also closer to the valuation date.  Using the capacity data from the BT 2016 OSF \nreport, Mr Bezant then calculated a median price per unit capacity multiple implied by \nthe auction  sale prices achieved for the 23 OSFs of UAH 212 per tonne.  \n1372.  However , an important further adjustment was required because it was apparent both \nfrom BT’s 2016 OSF report and the Restated OSF reports that the 23 OSFs sold at \nauction in 2019 were likely to have been in a worse condition than the remaining OSFs .  \nUsing t he data in the Restated OSF reports , a simple comparison  of the median value \nper unit capacity  implied on the one hand in respect of  the 23 OSFs and on the other  \nhand in respect of t he remaining OSFs disclosed a 470% difference.  Mr Bezant \ntherefore considered  it was necessary when valuing the remaining OSFs to apply a  \n470%  premium to the median price per unit capacity multiple implied by the auction \nsale prices achieved for the 23 OSFs  to ensure that th ose remaining OSFs were not \nundervalued.   This gave a higher value than the Restated 2016 Values and also a higher \nvalue than the amounts which would  have been attributed to the remaining OSFs if he \nhad simply applied the auction prices achieved for those sold during the course of 2020 \nand 2021, when, as he explained , there was like ly to have been a distortion from their \n2016 values caused by the pandemic . \n1373.  Mr Bezant  accepted in both his written and oral evidence that the approach he had \nadopted was subject to important limitations .  However, he did not agree that this should \nhave led to him looking at and working into his calculations more of the data to be \nderived from the 2016 OSF reports prepared by BT  and Veritas .  He regarded the actual \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n338 \n prices achieved from the auction sales  as a materially more appropriate  starting point \nfor his assessment  than any computation infected by the unreliable data, which I am \nsatisfied was fabricated to a material extent .  I think that he was correct about this , even \nthough this involved the application of hindsight . I have reached th e conclusion that an \napplication of hindsight in valuing the OSFs is not objectionable for similar reasons to \nthose I have explained in relation to the petrol stations (see paragraph 1268  above).   It \nwould only be necessary to exclude hindsight if the evidence indicated that the OSFs \nwere operational and in a materially better condition as at the valuation date in 2016  \nthan they were as at the auction sale date  in 2019.

Putting aside the fabricated data, as I must, \nthere is no material evidence to support a conclusion that there w as a mater ial \ndeterioration in or reduction in the value of the OSFs between those two dates.  \n1374.  Having analysed the evidence, I have r eached the very clear conclusion that neither a \nDCF valuation  nor Mr Kaczmarek’s comparable cross -check which was elevated to a \nvaluation basis in its own right in Mr Kolomoisky’s closing submissions , provides a \nsound basis for assessing the market or fair value of the OSFs at the time of the Asset \nTran sfers.  While Mr Bezant’s approach has to be treated with care as well, most \nparticularly because he had no information on whether the condition of the 23 OSFs \ndeteriorat ed between 2016 and 2019, I think that it is materially more reliable than the \napproach adopted by Mr Kaczmare k. \n1375.  I am therefore satisfied that the valuation advanced by Mr Bezant is to be preferred and \nthat on the balance of probabilities the fair  market  value of the 74 OSFs was UAH \n538,341,346  when they were transferred to the Bank’s books at the time of the Asset \nTransfers.  It follows that this is  the OSF-related amount for which the Bank is required \nto give credit to the Defendants in its claim for the losses which it sustained in \nconsequence of the Misappropriation . \n \nAsset Transfers: value of Hotel Zirka  \n1376.  The credit value attributed to Hotel Zirka was originally UAH 3,601 , based on two \nreports prepa red by UCE  in December 2015 and May 2016 , but was then reduced four \nmonths later in early October 2016 to UAH 1, 617 million  on the basis of a Veritas \nreport dated 17 August 2016 .  It seems that t he NBU then accepted a higher value of \nUAH 1,693 million , although the parties and their experts were unable to assist on how \nthat figure was reached.  Both  UCE and Veritas used a  combination of an  income and \na market approach  for their valuations .  The Restated 2016 Value of Hotel Zirka was \nassessed as  at 31 December 2016 in a report prepared by Asset Expertise in July 2019  \nat a figure of UAH 874 million . \n1377.  The value attributed to Hotel Zirka  by the Bank’s expert (Mr Bezant) was UAH 1, 072 \nmillion  who assessed its value using a DCF approach .  The value attributed to it by Mr \nKolomoisky’s expert (Mr Kaczmarek), was UAH 1,321  million.  The difference \nbetween the parties’ respective valuations was therefore UAH 249 million and the \namount by which the Bank claimed that the credit value exceeded its true value was \nUAH 545 million.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n339 \n 1378.

It was said that it followed from this that its loss had not been reduced \nby reference to the value of Hotel Zirka at all .  This remained its case at the time it put \nin written submissions on valuation issues on 11 July 2023 and at the stage at which Mr \nBezant and Mr Kaczmarek were cross -examined.   However , by the tim e of its closing \nsubmissions the point was no longer in issue and the Bank had confirmed that it would \ngive credit for the true value of Hotel Zirka at the time of the Asset Tran sfers.  \n1380.  Both Mr Bezant and Mr Kaczmarek agreed that the Veritas 2016 report on the basis of \nwhich the Bank attributed it  a reduced credit value, c ontains errors in the valuation \nanalysis  leading to an overstatement of value , a view which was also shared by EY.   \nThe experts both agreed that M r Bezant’s  valuation and supporting assumptions in \nrelation to the main hotel building being wor th UAH  1,072  million was reasonable .  \nHowever , they disagreed on whether the value of the hotel as a whole should be \nincreased to reflect the value of its secondary building or whether the value of this \nbuilding is already reflected in their valuation of the main buildi ng.  This was the only \nsubstantial issue which arose in relation to Hotel Zirka and was the sole reason for the \nvaluation difference of UAH 249 million between the two experts . \n1381.  The basis for Mr Bezant’s opinion was that the DCF approach he adopted for the \npurposes of valuing the hotel as a whole  employed historic revenue and cost \ninformation contained in Veritas’ 2016 report , the report prepared by Asset Expertise \nin 2019 and publicly available information .  Crucially , he said that ther e was no \nevidence that there was any basis for attributing a separate income stream to the \nsecondary building and ancillary facilities which was not already reflected in and \nabsorbed by the conclusi ons he had reached based on a discounted  cash flow for the \nhotel as a whole.  \n1382.  Mr Kaczmarek ’s attribution of an additional UAH 249  million to the value of Hotel \nZirka does not reflect a challenge to Mr Bezant’s DCF model , because he considers that \nMr Bezant’s methodology and assumptions are reasonable.   His evidence is that the \nadditional figure is  attributable to the income generating potential of the secondary \nbuilding and ancillary facilities which he assumes are likely to have  generate d rent from \nthe housed employees .  Even i f there was no direct income generation from that source , \nit is his view that  it is likely that that the benefit of on -site accommodation for the \nemployees would be reflected in a reduced wage bill by reason of the value of the \nbenefit in kind  to which the y would have been entitled .  His evidence was to the effect \nthat this would in itself feed through to a compensat ing increase in the net income \ncapable of being generated by the asset as a whole.  \n1383.  In my judgment , the evidence does not justify Mr Kaczmarek in making that \nassumption .  If the employees  paid rent by way of a reduction in their  wages, then that \nwould be accounted for in lower operating costs which,  based on historic costs figures, \nwere already accounted for in Mr Bezant’s valuation.  Therefore the question of fact \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n340 \n for the court is whether the employees who  occup ied the secondary  building paid rent , \nwhich was then capable of being reflected as a  distinct income stream  in Hotel Zirka’s \naccounts .

I also accept that i t is common for remote hotels to offer \nfree accommodation to staff , a view which , together with its consequences was well \nsummarised in the following passage from EY’s November 2016 audit s tatus report:  \n“It should be noted that in the market practice, hotel complexes located in resort \nareas distant from large cities (which are sources for workers) very often include \nauxiliary premises or buildings for employee accommodation. In our \nunderstanding, the emplo yee accommodation building in this case is an integral \npart of the hotel complex, without which it would be more difficult to operate the \nhotel, potentially entailing higher operating expenses. Therefore, we consider that \nthe result obtained as part of th e income approach is the value of the whole hotel \ncomplex. ” \n1384.  I also accept the Bank’s submission that , leaving aside the differences in the valuation \nfigures ultimately assessed by the various valuers who looked at Hotel Zirka between \n2015 and 2019 , there was a heavy  weight of opinion that it would be wrong as a matter \nof principle to apportion a separate value to the auxiliary building .  While the Veritas \nreport records a separate value for the buildin g, it was the only other report which took \nthat approach and was a shaky basis for Mr Kaczmarek to follow suit given  his overall \nview that the report as a whole was unreliable in light of the errors in the valuation \nanalysis that it contained.   This is well illustrated by the fact that the  Veritas assessment \nattributed value to the ancillary building by considering comparables which were \nthemselves hotel s rather than by reference to its status as staff accommodation.   \nFurthermore the experts’ joint statement records that  the first -listed author of the \nVeritas report was also an author  of the r eport  prepared by Asset Expertise (prepared \nin 2019 but as at July 2016) , which attributed no additional value to the ancillary \nbuilding because it and the main hotel  “operate as a single, high -level ho tel service \nfacility” .  This fact taken alone erodes to a considerable extent the submission made on \nbehalf of Mr Kolomoisky that there is no basis for the Bank to seek to undermine what \nis called the “clear evidence” from Veritas.  \n1385.  It follows that in my judgment the valuation advanced by Mr Bezant is to be preferred.  \nThe Hotel Zirka -related amount for which the Bank is required to give credit to the \nDefendants i n its claim  for the losses which it sustained in consequence of the \nMisappropriation  is UAH 1,07 1,767,313 .  \n \nAsset Transfers: value of Hotel Mir \n1386.  The Original 2016 Value ( i.e., the credit value ) attributed to Hotel Mir was UAH 449 \nmillion , based  on a report dated 31 July 2015 valuing it as at 30 July 2015 .  Hotel Mir’s \nRestated 2016 Value was UAH 226 million, based on a report dated 1 January 2019 by \nExpert+. The value attributed to it by Mr Bezant was UAH 252 million. The value \nattributed to it by Mr Kaczmarek, was UAH 259 million.

The difference between the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n341 \n parties’ respective valuations was therefore UAH 7 million .  Hotel Mir was al so the \nsubject of two other valuations as at the time of the Asset Transfer: a report by Colliers \nInternational  (“Colliers” ) which valued  it at UAH 259 million as at 2 7 February 2015  \nand one by Expandia LLC , CBRE  International’s local subsidiary (“CBRE”) , which \nvalued it  as at 1 July 2016 as UAH 270 million.   It can therefore be seen that the amount \nby which the Bank claimed that the credit value exceeded its true value was (at UAH  \n197 million) , a difference that was very substantially more than the difference between \nall of the other contemporary valuations .  This caused Mr Kaczmarek to describe the \nUCE report as a “significant outlier”.  \n1387.  Hotel Mir is situated in the Holosiivskyi area of Kyiv  and comprises a 3 star hotel  with \n138 rooms , separately leased office space and two warehouses.  Mr Bezant explained \nwhy he was of the opinion that the office space generated a substantially greater \nEBITDA  than the hotel space, which lead to him allocating the majority of the value to \nthat part of the asset.  He ascribed no separate value to the warehouse space on the basis \nthat it was required for the operation of the hotel and generated no separate income for \nits own account.  \n1388.  As I explained in paragraph 531 above t here is a preliminary issue which arises in \nrelation to this asset . The Bank’s pleaded case is that it has lost title to Hotel Mir \nfollowing a complicated series of proceedings brought in Ukraine . The Bank  therefore \nsubmitted that its loss has not been reduced by any recovery made from that source.   At \nthe commencement of the trial , the position , as explained in part in the Bank’s opening \nsubmissions and in part by Mr Beketov in his report,  was as set out in the follow ing \nparagraphs . \n1389.  On 10 June 2016,  Hotel Mir, which was owned as to 40% by Ardena LLC and as to \n60% by Artis LLC , two companies ultimately owned by the Individual Defendants , had \nbeen pledged to the Bank by Ardena  in order  to secure its Relevant Loan to AEF .  On \n13 June 2016, in apparent reliance on the pledge (rather than any absolute transfer of \ntitle), the Original 2016 Value of Hotel Mir was applied to reduce AEF’s debt under  its \nRelevant Loan .  After nationalisation, the Bank then took steps to foreclose against \nHotel Mir and became its registered title -holder on 4 August 2017.  \n1390.  Meanwhile, i n September 2016, the shares in Artis and Ardena were  sold to two \nBelizean companies, Rivage Limited and Sanbian Investment Limited , said by the \nIndividual Defendants to be in the ultimate beneficial ownership of two employees of \nPBC, but in fact in the beneficia l ownership of the Individual Defendants .  On 8 \nNovember 20 19, AEF brought a claim against the Bank and Ardena (with Artis later \njoined as a third party) to invalidate the mortgage by which Hotel Mir had been pledged \nand then acquired by  the Bank on the grounds that Ardena had lacked authority to \npledge Artis’ interest .  AEF’s claim failed at first instance , but an appeal by both AEF \nand Artis was allowed  by the Northern Commercial Court of Appeal on 9 July 2020  \nfollowing which the Bank’s  registered title to Hotel Mir was cancelled and Artis and \nArdena re -acquired title.   This decision was then overturned by the Supreme Court on \n14 January 20 21 and a re-trial was ordered , but in the meantime  Artis and Ardena had \ndisposed of Hotel Mir  to a company called Promyslova Korporatsiiya Prom Export \nLLC . \n1391.

This led to a further round of proceedings , in which both AEF and  Artis  were claimants .  \nOn 28 July 2021, the mortgage of Hotel Mir was declared invalid at first instance  by \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n342 \n the Commercial Court , a decision which was upheld in a judgment  of the Northern \nCommercial Court of Appeal on 18 January 2022 and by the Supreme Court  on 16 \nAugust 2022 . This complicated series of events , the essence of which was not disputed \nby the Individual De fendants (save for the beneficial ownership of the two Belizean \ncompanies  which was not admitted) meant that as at the commencement of the trial the \nBank  had not recovered title to Hotel Mir.  \n1392.  In the closing submissions made on behalf of Mr Kolomoisky it was explained that the \nposition had moved on since the commencement of the tria l.  It was said that in \nDecember 2022, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine submitted their own appeal against \nthe July 2021 decision  of the Commercial Court .  On 13 September 2023, the Northern \nCommercial Court of Appeal closed that appeal on the basis that the decision of the \nCommercial Court ha d already been confirmed by the Cassation Court.   However, th at \ndecision h as also been appeal ed by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine , and on 12 \nOctober  2023  the Supreme Court formed a panel to consider that appeal, together with \na cassation appeal filed by the Bank. The Defendants submitted that it was therefore \nclear that the proceedings in relation to the ownership of Hotel Mir were ongoing , and \nthat the Court should consider  and determine the issues relating to  the valuation of Hotel \nMir, as the proceedings in Ukraine may ultimately result in the Bank ’s ownership of  \nHotel Mi r being established , with the consequence that the Bank would be required to \ngive credit for that value.   In its oral closing submissions, the Bank suggested that the \nissue be parked . \n1393.  Although t he difference between the valuations advanced by Mr Bezant and Mr \nKaczmarek is only UAH 7 million (the US$ equivale nt of which is approximately \nUS$300,000) , I still think it is appropriate to express my conclusion on the right value \non the grounds that it is  still possible that the Ukrainian proceedings may result in the \nBank owning Hotel Mir and being required to give credit for it.   However,  it would not \nbe proportionate to devote a significant amount of time to explaining the conclusion I \nhave reached . \n1394.  In reaching his conclusions, Mr Bezant carried out his own valuation, and reached his  \nfigure of  UAH 252 million as an aggregate of the office space at UAH 219.9 million \nand the hotel space at UAH 32.4  million.  He had insufficient data to carry out a DCF \nvaluation but valued both parts using comparable valuation multiples  i.e., in the case of \nthe office space, the value per square metre of comparable properties located in the \nsame part of Kyiv as Hotel Mir  and in the case of the hotel space by an analysis o f the \nthree core inputs, viz. the number of rooms, the  average daily rate and the average \noccupancy  rate.  \n1395.   Mr Kaczmarek said that , in the light of the number of contemporary valuations “within \na reasonably focused range” (apart from the UCE Report), it was not necessary to  \ndevelop a de novo  valuation analysis of Hotel Mir  in order to arrive at his own view of \nits fair market v alue.

He then went on conclude that the best of the contemporary \nreports was what he called the value approved by the NBU of UAH 259 million in 2015 .  \nThis was a reference to the report prepared by Colliers which valued Hotel Mir as at \nFebruary 2015  and which the EY November 2016 Report indicated had been approved \nby the NBU .  Quite apart from the timing discrepancy (this was almost 18 mont hs \nbefore the Asset Transfer) , I think that there was substance in Mr Bezant’s view that \none of the problems with the Colliers’ report is that it assumed tha t the hotel space could \nbe converted into offices without accounting for any costs of that conversion .  This then \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n343 \n enabled it to  proceed on the basis that all of the buildings were already operati ng as \noffices rather than a proportion being hotel space.  \n1396.  In my view,  although the difference betwee n the experts is not very substantial, the \nvaluation advanced by Mr Bezant is to be preferred  for three principal reasons.  The \nfirst is  that it contains a thorough and logical analysis by the expert who actually gave \nevidence ; the substance of Mr Kaczmarek’s view was second -hand.  The second is that \nMr Bezant’s is more reliable because it did not proceed on the basis that all of the \nbuildings were already operating as offices rather than a proportion being hotel space.  \nThe third is that it assessed a value as at the time of the Asset Transfer s, rather than a \nyear earlier , which was the date of the Colliers report on which Mr Kaczmarek relied .  \nAs to this third point, I think that the Bank was justified in criticising an inconsistency \nin Mr Kaczmarek’s approach give n that he had expressed the view elsewhere that early \n2015 valuation s of other real estate assets ( offices in Dnipro and Hotel Zirka) were too \noutdated for inclusion in the Bank’s 2016 financial statements.  \n1397.  It follows that , on the basis that the Ukrainian proceedings result in the Bank owning \nHotel Mir and on the basis that the Bank is  required to give credit for its true value  in \nits claim for the losses which it sustained in consequence of the Misappropriation , the \namount for which it  is required to do so is UAH 252,332,499 . \n \nAsset Transfers: value of Kyiv Office  \n1398.  The Kyiv Office is located at 10 Muzeinyi La ne, in the Perchesky district of Kyiv . It \nwas transferred to the Bank on 6 June 2016.  \n1399.  The credit value attributed to the Kyiv Office  (i.e., its Original 2016 Value) was UAH \n321.7 million , which was based on a UCE valuation dated 18 June 2015 .  The Restated \n2016 Value was UAH 193 .7 million.  The value attributed to it by Mr Bezant was UAH \n194.2 million , which was a mid -point in his assessed range of somewhere between \nUAH 186 .3 million and UAH 202 million . The value attributed to it by Mr Kaczmarek \nwas UAH 245 million , which was based on a value said by the Defendants to have been \nverified by the NBU .  The difference between the parties’ respective valuations was \ntherefore UAH 51 million (which the experts said was “small relative to some of the \nother assets”) and the amount by which the Bank claimed that the credit value exceeded \nits true value was UAH 128 million.  \n1400.

The experts referred to one other report  which w as produced at the time of the Asset \nTransfer s.  In October 2016, CBRE valued the Kyiv Office as at 1 July 2016 at an \noverall figure of UAH 207 million, having first assessed it at UAH 93  million on an \nincome approach  and UAH 236  million  on a market approach.

Having \nconsidered two unidentified report s, one of which seems likely to have been  the CBRE \nreport and the other of which was said to have assessed the value of the Kyiv Office at \nUAH 268 million,  the EY November  2016  Report  came up with a range of betw een \nUAH 201 million to UAH 235 million.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n344 \n 1401.  Mr Bezant used a market comparables approach and an income approach for his \nvaluation.  In carrying out that exercise he derived his inputs both from the other reports \nand from his market research.  His market comparables approach produced an implied \nvalue range of between UAH 186 .3 million and UAH 235.5 million , while his income \napproach produced a range of between UAH  104.2 million and UAH 202 million.  The \nrange which overlapped an assessment based on the market comparables approach and \nthe income approach was therefore between UAH 186.3 million and UAH  202 million .  \nMr Bezant then took the midpoint of UAH 194.2 million as his valuation , a figure which \nhe correctly identified as being consistent with the other valuations I have described \nabove , apart from the original UCE valuation which was an obvious outlier  and on \nwhich n either of the experts relied . \n1402.  Mr Bezant was criticised by Mr Howard for taking this approach on the grounds that it \nwas “pseudoscience” .  He was also criticised for not using the valuation figure that was \nused by the NBU.  He disagreed because  there was no underlying valuation report and \nsaid that there was therefore no evidence or analysis available as to how or why the \nNBU had ‘verified’ this value.   In short, u nlike the other reports which he was able to \ninterrogate, examine and compare with his own assessment, he could not do anythi ng \nwith the UAH 245 million figure  because there was  no information behind it.   In any  \nevent , even though the source of this  value  was described in the EY November  2016 \nReport as being a figure verified by the N BU, EY were not prepared to confirm that \nthey considered it was a fair value, because the EY November 2016 Report recorded its \nown desk review as  requiring a value range correction to b etween UAH 201 million \nand UAH 235 million.  \n1403.  Mr Kaczmarek  took a different approach .  He did not carry out his own valuation \nexercise , but simply relied on what he described as the “value approved by the  NBU ”, \nexplaining that this was what he regarded as the most relevant figure , a point which he \ndeveloped in cross -examination by describing it as a “contemporaneous valuation that \nwas done and approved by the NBU outside of this dispute context”.   He maintained \nthat position,  even though he accepted that there was no available valuation which \nsupported  UAH 245 million  and that EY’s desk review of that valuation corrected it to \na value range the top of which was significantly less and the bottom of which was only \nUAH 7 million greater than Mr Bezant’s valuation . \n1404.

I prefer Mr Bezant’s assessment .  He carried out his own valuation which was carefully \nreasoned and derived from a range of legitimate inputs.  I also think t hat the \ncharacterisation of his approach to the overlap  in the range he derived from the market \ncomparable approach and the income approach as “pseudoscience ” is unfair.  In my \nview, Mr Bezant’s opinion that , in the circumstances of this case, the most justifiable \napproach was to look for a figure within the overlap between two different but \nlegitimate  valuation techniques, on the basis that he considered that both methods had \nforce , is preferable to the line take n by Mr Kaczmarek . \n1405.  By contrast, I think that Mr Kaczmarek’s approach was unhelpful , in the sense that  it \nboiled down to little more than faith in what he called the NBU’s verification process.   \nI agree that, like many valuations, there is no precise science to any assessment  of the \nvalue of the Kyiv Office  at the time of the Asset Transfer s.  But simply to say (as he \ndid) that, based on his experience of working with bank regulators, it would have been \nrigorously reviewed , is a thin  justification for saying that carrying out a proper valuation \nof his own was not necessary.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n345 \n 1406.  In some respects this is the starkest example of an asset valuation in which Mr \nKaczmarek placed real weight on the verification of asset valu es by the NBU.  Similar \nissues arose in relation to the value of the Stadium, the Training Centre, the Dnipro \nOffice and the Airfield .  I accept that the  fact that the NBU agreed in 2016 to accept \nthat Transferred Assets such as the Kyiv Office had a particular value for regulatory or \ncapital adequacy purposes is capable of being relevant to the question of whether the \nBank is now bound as against the Defendants by the values which were then attributed \nto those assets .  However, i t is less obvious why the NBU ’s acceptance of those values \nshould , in and of itself,  have very much weight for the purposes of establishing their \ntrue value as between the Bank and the Defendants.  The NBU was not itself an expert \nvaluer and , if it is not possible to identify a valuation on which the  NBU might have \nrelied, and which is i tself capable of being scrutinised for the purpose of identifying \nany flaws, the evidential weight which can be attached to the mere fact that the NBU \naccepted that value is limited.  \n1407.  In my judgment the evidence points to the best estimate of the value of the Kyiv Office \nat the time of the Asset Transfers as being UAH 194 ,183,249 . \n \nAsset Transfers: value of the Dnipro Office  \n1408.  The Dnipro Office has been described as an engineering laboratory building located in \nthe Zhovtnevy district of Dnipro at 32 Naberezhna Peremohy Street .  Although it had \nbeen an engineering laboratory and a warehouse it was reconstructed as administrative \noffice premises at some stage after 2010.  It was held in the name of Okeanmash LLC \nand like the Kyiv Office was transferred to the Bank on 6 June 2016.  \n1409.  The original credit value attributed to the Dnipro Office by the Bank was UAH 453 \nmillion .  This value was based on a valuation from UCE  as at June 2015 , but that  credit \nvalue was then reduced to the recognised Original 2016 Value of UAH 212 million  on \n26 September 2016 .

This figure was the amount described in the  EY November 2016 \nReport as the NBU verified value , and seems to have been based on a valuation report \nfrom Kreston dated 4 August 2016 assessing  the Dnipro Office’s value as at 1 July \n2016 .  Unlike the Kyiv Office, the Dnipro Office was not given a Restated 2016 Value \nat the time of the Bank’s 2018 financial statements.  \n1410.  As with  the Kyiv Office, Expert+ also produced a report  valuing the Dnipro Office \ndated January 2019 .  It assessed the value of the Dnipro Office at UAH 183.4  million \nas at 1 October 2016.  There was also a non -specific valuation paper from Synex LLC \nwhich came up with a  figure of UAH 184.2 million  as at 31 October  2017.  EY’s \ndesktop review which led to the EY November 2016 Report considered two reports , \nwhich were not specifically identified, one of which had assessed a value of the Dnipro \nOffice at UAH 377 million and the other of which had assessed a value of  UAH 2 12 \nmillion.   It is tolerably clear that the second of these was the Kreston report but the first \nhas not been identified.  Having regard to what EY considered to be methodological \nerrors, t he EY November 2016 Report produced a potential fair value range of between \nUAH 181 million and UAH 194 million . \n1411.  The value attributed to it Mr Bezant was UAH 175 million. The value attributed to it \nby Mr Kaczmarek, was UAH 2 12 million , i.e., the ultimately recognised Original 2016 \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n346 \n Value.   The difference between the parties’ respective valuations of the Dnipro Office \nwas therefore UAH 37 million , the same figure as  the amount by which the Bank \nclaimed that the credit value exceeded its true value.   Mr Bezant said that although the \nOriginal 2016 Value for the Dnipro Office of UAH 212 (which was adopted by Mr \nKaczmarek) l ies above his valuation range it did not do so significantly .  Both  experts \nagreed that the other ’s valuation was not unreasonable, Mr Kaczmarek said that “I \ncertainly don’t believe it’s [sc. Mr Bezant’s valuation] unreasonable”   and Mr Bezant \nsaid the UAH 212  million value “is high but may still be reasonable” . \n1412.  As with his valuation of the Kyiv Office, Mr Bezant used a market comparables \napproach and an income approach for his valuation  of the Dnipro Office .  In carrying \nout that exercise he derived his inputs both from the other reports and from his market \nresearch.  His market comparables approach produced an implied value range of \nbetween UAH 147.4 million and UAH 266.5 million, while his income approach \nproduced a range of between UAH 113.1 million and UAH 202.6 million.  The range \nwhich overlapped an assessme nt based on the market comparables approach and the \nincome approach was therefore between UAH 147 .4 million and UAH 202 .6 million.  \nMr Bezant then adopted the same approach he had  taken to valuing the Kyiv Office and \ntook the midpoint of UAH 175 million as his valuation, a figure which he correctly \nidentified as being consistent with the other valuations I have described above, apart \nfrom the original UCE valuation on which neither of the experts relied.  \n1413.  Mr Kaczmarek justified his approach on the basis that Kreston valuation was IFRS \ncompliant and  that, although he might not have used the  same parameters as those used \nby Kreston if he had conducted his own valuation,  any differences would have been no \nmore than the types of difference which are commonplace amongst valuers.

As with \nthe Kyiv Office Building, he also relied on the fact that the NBU had approved the \nvaluation.   \n1414.  Although the differences between the experts are not very significant, I prefer the \napproach which was taken by Mr Bezant for reasons which are very similar to those \nwhich apply in relation to the Kyiv Office.

This was no more than a limited acceptance of the Kreston \nvaluation, which as I have already explained was subject to the review process carried \nout by EY, who were not prepared to confirm that they cons idered it was a fair value, \nbecause the EY November 2016 Report recorded that a value range correction to \nbetween UAH 181 million and UAH 194 million  was required.  While t he bottom of \nthis range was UAH 6 million above Mr Bezant’s valuation , the top of it was UAH 18 \nmillion below Mr Kaczmarek ’s.  It follows that, as with the Kyiv Office,  one of the \nfactors on which he placed particular reliance was not properly understood by him.  \n1416.  In my judgment, i t also follows that, while neither expert’s evidence of value of the \nDnipro Office was itself unreasonable, the evidence points to the best estimate of the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n347 \n value of the Dnipro Office at the time of the Asset Transfers as being UAH \n175,000,280 . \n \nAsset Transfers: value of the Stadium  \n1417.  The credit value attributed to the Stadium was UAH 1,517  million  (i.e. its Original 2016 \nValue) , which was based on a combined market and cost approach to valuation assessed \nby UCE in a report prepared  in 2015 .  Its Restated 2016 Value  was assessed as at 31 \nDecember 2016 in a report prepared by Sinex Firm  LLC (“Sinex”) in January 2019  at \na figure of  UAH 16 million . Sinex adopted an income approach to its valuation , but \nneither of the experts relied on it .  The value attributed to the Stadium by Mr Thomas  \nwas UAH 125 million  as at a valuation date of 6 June 2016, being the date of transfer \nto the Bank .  The value attributed to the Stadium  by Mr Kolomoisky’s expert (Mr \nKaczmarek), was UAH 1,544 million .  He b ased his opinion  on (and adopted the figures \ncontained in) a report prepared by Veritas dated 18 August 2 016, which valued the \nStadium  as at 30 June 2016 and applied a cost  approach .  The Veritas figure was the \nsame as the amount described in the EY November 2016 Report as the NBU verified \namount.  The difference between the parties’ respective valuations was therefore UAH \n1,418 million and the amount by which the Bank claimed that the credit value exceeded \nits true value was UAH 1,392  million.  \n1418.

As at the date of  the Asset Transfers, the Stadium, which was completed in 2008, was \nthe home of FC D nipro.  It was a 31,000 se at stadium which was originally built to \ncomply with the requirements for holding UEF A and FIFA games.  The evidence \ndemonstrate d that the per capita use of the Stadium had dropped off quite sharply over \nthe previous five years .  Although the number of games was holding relatively steady \nat between 15 and 20 per annum, the average attendance per game was in steady decline \ndropping  from 19,509 in 2012 to 7 ,307 in 2016 .  Consistently with this evidence , no \nEuropean football club games were played at the Stadium after the Russian invasion of \nCrimea in 2014 .  Although the FC Dnipro team itself continued to participate in the \nEuropa League, it played i ts game s in Kyiv  because UEFA had taken the view that it \nwas too dangerous to allow the Stadium  to host European games . \n1419.  The experts took completely different approach es to valuation  of the Stadium , which \nexplained the dramatic difference s in value  which they arrived at .  Mr Thomas took an \nincome approach , i.e., a DCF valuation.  He did so because he considered the Stadium  \nto be an income -generating asset .  Mr Kaczmarek considered that there was insufficient \ninformation to conduct a n income based DCF valuation and that there were no \nappropriate comparables  to which suitable adjustments might be applied in order to \nenable a market approach.   He therefore said that a cost approach to valuatio n was the \ncorrect way of reaching a fair or a market value  and to that end he simply adopted the \nconclusions of t he Veritas report  which stated that the construction costs in euros was \n€65 million.   This implied a UAH cost of UAH 696 million at a December 2008 \nexchange rate and UAH  1,755 million at a December 2016 exchange rate . \n1420.  There was no real issue  that a cost approach involves ascertaining the current cost to \nreplace the relevant asset .  It is described in the following way in IFRS 13: \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n348 \n “From the perspective of a market participant seller, the price that would be \nreceived for the asset is based on the cost to a market participant buyer to acquire \nor construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence. That \nis bec ause a market participant buyer would not pay more for an asset than the \namount for which it could replace the service capacity of that asset.  … \nObsolescence encompasses physical deterioration, functional (technological) \nobsolescence and economic (external ) obsolescence...”  \n1421.  Mr Kaczmarek  also said that an assessment of fair value does not prioritise the cost \napproach  over any other approach but instead requires the valuer to utilise  the technique \nthat is most objective and least subjective , by maximising the use of observable market \nbased inputs when executing each valuation technique .  Put another way, h e said that  a \nvaluer should make use of the approach that maximises the use of observable inputs \nand minimises the use of unobservable inputs .  In his view t his means that the cost \napproach is most appropriate for the Stadium  because it best achieves that end.   The \nDefendants relied on the fact that this was the methodology  which they said that the \nNBU’s 2016 validation of Veritas’ valuation accepted was appropriate . \n1422.

Mr Kaczmarek's preference for th e cost  approach  used by Veritas  was also based on \nwhat he said would be the reluctance of a willing seller to sell the Stadium at a price \nless than the cost of its construction, less depreciation if applicable .  In relying on the \nVeritas 2016 r eport he noted that it (a) employed historical cost data taken from the \nagreements and contracts used to construct and equip the Stadium  indexed to 2016 , (b) \ncalculated the accumulated depreciation to be deducted by reference to depreciation \ntables and (c) valued the usage rights of the land underlying the Stadium by reference \nto the adjusted price of comparable land plots . \n1423.  For his part, Mr Thomas said that a cost  approach was unsatisfactory  because a \nknowledgeable and willing buyer will pay for a real estate asset an amount based on  \nwhat they can earn from the operation of the asset.   He said (and on this he was \nsupported by IVS 201 3) that the cost approach  is normally used where there is no \nevidence of transaction prices for comparable property and no identifiable actual or \nnotional income stream  accruing to the owner of the relevant interest.   He did not \nconsider it appropr iate to adopt the cost approach  in this case,  not just b ecause the \nStadium was capable of generating income , but also because there were sufficient \nobservable inputs to undertake an income based valuation .   \n1424.  Mr Thomas ’ general criticism that the cost approach was inappropriate to value an \nincome generating asset  was illustrated by a passage in IVS 2013 (p .67 para C22) which \nsaid the following about the costs approach:  \n“This approach is generally applied to the valuation of real property interests \nthrough the depreciated replacement cost method. It is normally used when there \nis either no evidence of transaction prices for similar property or no identifiable \nactual or no tional income stream that would accrue to the owner of the relevant \ninterest.”  \n1425.  This was  said by the Bank to be more particularly the case where the reason for adopting \nit was  what the Defendants advanced as a  presumed refusal by the seller to sell the \nStadium for less than the amount it cost to build .  It was also said by the Bank that it \nwas inappropriate to assume that the hypothetical buyer would be a person who already \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n349 \n owned a Dnipro -based football club for whom the Stadium would have a v alue over \nand above the income it can generate .  This criticism was developed in the Bank’s \nclosing submissions by focussing on the fact that it was common ground between the \nexperts that a fair  market valu e is concerned with a hypothetical transa ction between a \nwilling seller and a willing buyer .  It was said by the Bank that the Defendant’s \nhypothetical seller is not a willing seller  because it would not be  motivated to sell  the \nasset at market terms for the best price attainable in the open market after proper \nmarketing, whatever that price may be  (the IVS 2013 definition of a willing seller) . \n1426.  The Defendants submitted in closing that Mr Thomas agreed that , in addition to ticket \nsales a football club would also earn revenues from such things as TV rights and \nmerchandising which would not be reflected in a bare income analysis of the  Stadium \nalone.

They extrapolat ed from that an argument that it was illogical for Mr Thomas to \nignore the intangible benefits which might accrue to the owner of the Stadium on the \ngrounds that they would not accrue to a bank which was not itself operating a football \nteam , because it would be able to sell on to a purchaser who wa nted a football team to \nplay at the Stadium.  It was said that this meant that the Stadium’s value needed to \ninclude those valuable intangible benefits derived from the fact that a purchaser would \nbe a person who wished to make money not only out of the income stream which flows \ndirectly fro m the Stadium but also indirectly from those other intangible benefits as \nwell.  \n1427.  The Bank said that , even if this was correct so far as an occupying football club was \nconcerned, this was no t relevant to a valuation of the Stadium itse lf.  The pool of \npotential buyers was not limited to football clubs.  It also included proper ty \ndevelopment compan ies, local authorities or other third parties who might wish to rent \nout the Stadium to a football club  or for other sporting events .  On the other side of the \nequation, TV rights for games played and merchandising were available to a football \nclub independently of the Stadium .  While there might in principle be a revenue stream \nof what M r Howard called  intangible be nefits , they flowed from the business and \nactivities of  the club itself  not the Stadium it occupied , and if those were to be taken \ninto account it would be necessar y to take into account what a club has to pay (such as \nwages to players) as well as what it can earn from such benefits .  None of the valuers \nhad taken any of that into account.   \n1428.  I was persuaded  that, as a matter of principle, Mr Thomas was correct on th ese point s.  \nI do not accept Mr Kaczmarek ’s evidence  that a willing seller as d efined will hold onto \nan asse t in the hope that someone will turn up and pay the cost  price for it.   He might \nbe motivated by a desire not to sell at less  than cost price if he can , but that does not \nmake him a willing seller – it just makes him the holder of an asset which is now worth \nless than the amount it cost him to build . I also note that Mr Thomas’ view is consistent \nwith the way that  EY explained the position in the EY  November 2016 Report .  They \nhad carried a desktop review of the Stadium , but recommended a revaluation :  “From \nour point of view the value calculation must include the income base approach , as the \ncost approach for a stadium does not reflect the property's market value .” \n1429.  As to the Defendants’ submission  that the hypothetical buyer would be a person who \nalready owned a Dnipro -based football club for whom the Stadium would have a value \nover and above the income it can generate, I agree with the Bank’s submission t hat this \nwas another way of saying  that synergies from the ownership of a club might mean that \nan enhanced price may be obtainable from a sp ecial purchaser . On that basis , I think \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n350 \n that the Bank was correct to submit that what such a purchaser might be prepared to \npay is not market value because it does not disregard all elements of special value to a \nparticular  willing buyer  and does not limit itself to the value to an assumed willing \nbuyer , who is not a special purchaser and who will therefor e (as Mr Thomas put it in \ncross -examination) “want to recover their investment by earning income” . \n1430.

In Mr Kolomoisky’s closing submissions , reliance was placed on some of Mr Thomas’ \nanswers in cross -examination in support of a suggestion that a willing buyer of the \nStadium might pay more than  a valuation which only reflected the Stadium’s direct \nincome earning potential.  It was asked rhetorically : why in those circumstances  should  \nit nevertheless be valued solely on that basis ?  I did not read Mr Thomas ’ evidence in \nthe way contended for by the Defendants .  Nothing which Mr Thomas said detracted \nfrom the  basic proposition that, whether or not a particular category of purchaser might \nbe able to enhance its total return by combining  a club with  the Stadium  does not affect \nthe appropriate valuation of the Stadium itself , which was the only asset which the Bank \ntook on to its balance sheet in 2016 . \n1431.  Mr Thomas also criticised another of Veritas’  explanation s (likewise adopted by Mr \nKaczmarek) for why it had refused to apply the income approach .  In some respects it \namounted to another way of putting a similar point .  It had said that an income  approach \nwas extremely time consuming to compute because it is necessary to take into account \na multitude of different nuances and details specific to football stadium s.  It also did \nnot account for the social consequences of an asset like the stadium including “growth \nof national pride, solidarity, happiness , joy and harmony ”, an increase in the number of \nthose going into sports and the consequential increase in the overall health of the nation, \nimprovement of the sports result s of the host team and the  increased interest in the city .  \nThese of course are  social conse quences  which may  enure  to the benefit of Dnipro \ngenerally, but as Mr Thomas pointed out (and I agree),  the income generating capacity \nof the Stadium is more relevant to a potential buyer than social benefits  of that type . \n1432.  Mr Kaczmarek criticised Mr Thomas ’ income approach  on the basis that he also had \nused unobservable inputs , because the “notional” data for some of what he had taken \ninto account when calcula ting his EBITDA figure was highly uncertain.  Mr Thomas \ndid not dispute that there was indeed some uncertainty in relation to some of the figures \nhe had put forward , but said that his inputs were in  fact sufficiently observable  from the \npublic sources from which they were drawn .  Mr Kaczmarek also objected to Mr \nThomas' valuation on the basis of the disparity between it  and the valuation conducted \nby UC E in 2015 and Veritas in 2016 , a criticism which the Bank said was unfounded \nnot least b ecause Mr Kaczmarek himself had identified a number of f laws in UC E’s \nvaluation , including the fact that it did not explain the assumption that the highest and \nbest use of the Stadium was as office space for rent rather than as a football stadium . \n1433.  For his part, Mr Thomas also criticised the quality of the evidence on which Veritas \nhad relied as to the historical construction costs of the Stadium.   He said that there was \nno analysis to substantiate or verify those costs and that they therefore had to be treated \nas unobservable , which Mr Kaczmarek himself  had said were unsuitable as inputs when \ncarrying out a valuation based on a cost approach .  In particular , it became apparent \nduring the course of the evidence that some of the costs which were includ ed in Veritas’ \nbase figures were highly unreliable and in some respects significantly overinflated .  \nThus one of the exe rcises which Veritas carried out  in order to arrive at its cost based \nvaluation was to index the actual construction costs by"}

This seems to me to be a fair criticism as was the rather more obvious point \nthat some of the figures for the costs of equipment which were included in the \nconstruction costs were absurd – the evidence contained schedules itemising costs to \nbe taken into account such as potato peelers said to have a 2016 indexed cost of UAH \n120,000 a nd a Samsung  TV said to have a 2016 indexed cost of UAH 2.8 million  \n1434.  Mr Thomas  also said  that no proper adjustment had been made to account for \ndepreciation  and that the Marshall & Swift  tables which had been used by Veritas  \nappeared to relate to garages,  industrials and warehouses , which were inappropriate for \nan asset such as the Stadium.   I agree that the approach adopted by Veritas made little \nsense  because the same depreciation was applied to all of the assets being valued as \ncomponent parts of the whole on the basis that  Veritas assessed the standard service life \nof th e whole of the Stadium as 50 years .  This  then led to a figure of 5%  for physical, \nfunctional and economic depreciation without any attempt to depreciate the various \nelements of the cost included in the original construction figures by reference to a \nrealistic assessment of their true service life.   This too seems to me to  be a point which \nis well -founded . \n1435.  However, Mr Kaczmarek ’s more fundamental point in answer to Mr Thomas’ valuation \nwas that nobody would construct a stadium for a capital sum which was at least twelve \ntimes more (the sum quoted in euros was €65 million) than the value it might ultimately \nachieve based on an income approach (the sum quoted in euros was €5 million).  While \nMr Kaczmarek accepted that it is not unusual for a real property development to sell \nfor less than the amount it cost to build, the gravamen of his criticism of Mr Thomas ’ \nevidence was that the disparity in the present case is very significant indeed.  I ag ree \nthat the disparity is indeed striking, but I also think that it becomes much more \nexplicable when taking into account the substantial reduction in attendance and the \nattendant revenues since 2012, together with the inability to use the Stadium  for the \nUEFA -related purposes for which it was constructed (with the high tickets prices that \nmight then have been anticipated) because of the security situation following the \ninvasion of Crimea.  The conside rations I outlined in paragraph 1418  above  point to a \nprobability  that, even if the Stadium might have been worth its cost price immediately \nafter construction based on anticipated attendance and usage as at 2008 (for which \nfigures were not available), there would have been  a dramatic fall off in value in the \nlight of its prospects for profitable use some eight years later.  \n1436.  It is evident that measuring the impact of these kinds  of consideration is very difficult \nif a cost approach  alone  is used to value an asset.

But I accept the Bank’s submission \nthat t he way in which this should have been approached from a valuer’s perspective \nwas to give proper consideration  not just to the extent to which the elements within the \nconstruction costs of the Stadium should have been depreciated at a much greater rate, \nbut also  and probably more significantly to the issue of economic dep reciat ion or \nobsolescence.  Mr Thomas accepted that Veritas referred to economic obsolescence , \nbut he said that even though they had done so , it was apparent from the tables th ey used \nthat they had not carried out this exercise by using the tables . Mr K aczmarek accepted \nthat, on a proper reading of the Veritas report , its authors  did not identify that it had had \nany regard to this important consideration , but he sought to say that the reason they may \nhave done  so was simply because they did not think that any figure was appropriate.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n352 \n 1437.  I did not find Mr Kaczmarek’s evidence on this point to be very satisfactory.  I have \nlittle doubt that , in so far as the Veritas report did not take into account economic \nobsolescence , both  that report  and Mr Kaczmarek’s adoption of it , would have been \ndeficient for t his reason alon e.  Mr Kaczmarek suggested that it may have been taken \ninto account , but was not considered by Veritas to be material .  I do not think it is \npossible to make that assumption, because there was no proper explanation that that is \nwhat they had done (and that that was their view) but in light of my conclusion  that the \nvalue of the Stadium was significantly impaired by the economic obsolescence apparent \nfrom the kinds of consideration I have identified, some mechanism was required to \nmeasure it .  In the absence of proper comparables,  I agree with the Bank’s submission \nthat this throws a valuer back onto taking an income approach for the purposes of \nestimating the necessary adjustment for economic obsolescence in a cost approach \nvaluation .  This  is a very similar exercise to the DCF valuation carried out by Mr \nThomas . \n1438.  It was common ground between the experts (anyway after their cross -examinations) \nthat any such exercise  should proceed on the basis that the highest and best use of the \nStadium was as a sports stadium and that Mr Thomas had identified most of the sources \nof revenue in carrying out his valuation .  Against that background, Mr Thomas  analysed \nthe Stadium ’s annual revenue from ticket sales and the potential rental return  from the \noffice and storage space within the Stadium , based on five comparable properties o n \nthe market in Dnipro  in 2015 and 2016 .  He also added in the potential income stream \nfrom parking spaces , advertising  and other events in the Stadium assuming  three non \nfootball events per year, consistent with a report by a sports consultancy, based on an \naverage h ire price of UAH 300,000 per event .  He then deducted operating costs of \nUAH 3.6 million per annum of which 1/3 were staff  costs  (based on the number of \nemployees, his knowledge of the staff structure of Ukrainian businesses and wage \ncategories for the sports industry ), and 2/3 were other operating costs .  All of these \nfigures were supported by extraneous evidence.  This led to an  EBIT DA of UAH 18.9 \nmillion  capitalised by applying a rate of 15 % and led  to a market value of UAH 125.4 \nmillion . \n1439.

It was not really in issue that all of the inputs on which Mr Thomas relied were based \non credible evidence derived from verifiable sources.  Mr Kaczmarek also accepted that \nany TV revenue would not be an intrinsic revenue stream associated with the Stadium \nitself.   However, he said  that Mr Thomas had not consider ed all the potential revenue s, \nbecause he did not include  naming rights of the Stadium and he should have included a \nhigher number of non -football events per year.  He said that ten rather than three was a \nmore realistic figure based on the survey relied on by Mr Thomas .  The answer given \nby Mr Thomas to th ese criticism s was that he had been unable to identify any market \nin Ukraine  for corporate branding of the type suggested by Mr Kaczmarek , and that the \nmarket for non -football events was very limited  because of the priority which had to be \ngiven for football , the competition from another stadium in Dnipro for other outdoor \nevents and the relatively inhospitable climate for some types of outdoor events for up \nto six months of the year.  There was no evidence -based answer to Mr Thomas’ view \non this aspect of his valuation  and I consider that the assumptions he made in relation \nto them were reasonable.  \n1440.  The principa l costs which then went into Mr Thomas’ EBITDA  calculation for the \npurposes of his DCF valuation were  also accepted by both experts .  They were the costs \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n353 \n of employees, maintenance expenses and utilities .  Again, there was no evidence -based \nchallenge to the figures which Mr Thomas used for costs or expenses .  It follows that \nthe arithmetical exercise undertaken by Mr Thomas to reach his income approach to \nvaluing the Stadium was based on sound foundations and in my judgment adopts the \nright methodology for valuing the Stadium.  \n1441.  Mr Thomas also put forward  a single cross -check for his valuation in the form of  the \nprice achieved for the sale of a 34,000 seat stadium in Odessa called the Chernomorets \nstadium by the DGF  in 2020 .  This stadium  had been built in 2011  and was sold at \nauction to a US company for UAH 19 4 million.   He said that it was slightly newer and \nslightly larger that the Stadium and was sold three and a half years after his 2016 \nvaluation date.  Nonetheless , and although he did not put it forward as a direct \ncomparable,  he considered that in general terms it was consistent with his valuation as \na general cross -check.  \n1442.  In cross -examination, Mr Kaczmarek did not accept that it was “not a bad cross -check” \nor that it was “certainly the best cross -check we’ve got”; indeed he said it was a terrible \ncross -check , partly because the buyer was thought to be buying into a lot of litigation  \nas the former owner (who was not the actual seller) had refused to give up operational \ncontrol and partly, if somewhat inconsistently , because the buyer may in fact have been \na front for the original owner .  Whichever was closer to the truth , there was therefore \nwhat Mr Kaczmarek called “a lot involved in this transaction that I think causes me to \nhave some concern about its reliability”.  \n1443.  Whilst recognising that the sale of the Chernomorets stadium is  far from perfect as a \ncross check, I accept Mr Thomas’ evidence that it is  of some assistance .  It is not a  \ndirect comparable, but I  think that the disparity between the price achieved for the \nChernomorets stadium in 2020 and the valuation of the Stadium  advanced by Mr \nKaczmarek is so significant (the Stadium was said by him to be worth almost eight \ntimes as much ) that it points to him h"}

It is not a  \ndirect comparable, but I  think that the disparity between the price achieved for the \nChernomorets stadium in 2020 and the valuation of the Stadium  advanced by Mr \nKaczmarek is so significant (the Stadium was said by him to be worth almost eight \ntimes as much ) that it points to him having taken an unrealistic approach to his valuation \nand supports the Bank’s argument that it was  based on a flawed methodology .  \n1444.  In all of these circumstances , I am satisfied that Mr Thomas’ income approach is the \nmost appropriate methodology with which to value the Stadium at the time of the Asset \nTransfers  and that the inputs which he used for that purpose were both reasonable  and \nfounded on sufficient eviden ce.  I am also satisfied that the cost approach adopted by \nMr Kaczmarek is unreliable and reaches an unrealistically inflated value for the \nStadium .  The errors in this approach were made worse by a failure  to take sufficient \naccount of an appropriate rate  of physical and functional depreciation and wha t appears \nlikely to have been the absence of any recognition of economic obsole scence . \n1445.  I therefore find that  the best evidence available confirms that at the time of the Asset \nTransfers a fair market value of the Stadium was the figure  assessed by Mr Thomas, \ni.e. a sum of UAH 125 ,418,459 .  That is the figure arising out of the transfer of the \nStadium for which the Bank must give credit in its claim against the Defendants for the \nlosses which it sustained in consequence of the Misappropriation.  \n \nAsset Transfers:  value of  the Training Centre  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n354 \n 1446.  The credit value attributed to the Training Centre was UAH 670.5 million  (i.e. its \nOriginal 2016 Value), which was based on a combined market and cost approach to \nvaluation as at 9 April 2015 assessed by UCE in a report prepared in 2015 .  Its Restated \n2016 Value, assessed as at 31 December 2016 in  a report prepared by Sin ex in January \n2019 was UAH 142 million ; Sine x adopted a n income approach for its valuation . \n1447.  The value attributed to it by the Bank’s expert (Mr Thomas ) was UAH 105 million , as \nat a valuation date of 6 June 2016, being the date of transfer to the Bank.  The value \nattributed to it by Mr Kolomoisky’s expert (Mr Kaczmarek), was UAH 332 million.  \nThis was the figure which was then described in the EY November 2016 Report as \nhaving been verified by the NBU.  He based his opinion on a report prepared by Veritas \ndated 18 August 2016 which valued the Training Centre as at 30 June 2016 and applied \na cost ap proach.  The difference between the parties’ respective valuations was \ntherefore UAH 227 million and the amount by which the Bank claimed that the credit \nvalue exceeded its true value was UAH 565 million.  \n1448.  The Training Centre is located at Mykhailo Didevych (Pionersky) Lane 14 and 12, \nDnipro, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and consists of a complex of recreational facilities \ncompris ing four training fields, an indoor arena, two main buildings (with offices, living \nspace, a gym, pool, sauna and showers) and additional structures .  Its focus is on \nfootball and it can used by amateur, semi -professional and professional sports teams \nfor a fee.

As with the valuation of the Stadium, the principle disagreement between Mr Thomas \nand Mr Kaczmarek related to the appropriate methodology for carrying out the \nvaluation.   Mr Thomas contended that the Training Centre was an income generating \nasset and so an income approach was appropriate, while Mr Kaczmarek adopted the \ncost approach whic h had been used in Veritas’ August 2016 valuation .  Veritas adopted \na cost approach because it said that:  \n“It is impossible to use the income approach in this case because Training ground \nwas developed not for profit purposes, therefore, the concept of its design is based \non the values that would meet the achievement of the club's sports goals.”  \n1450.  Many of the same interconnected issues which arose in relation to the valuation of the \nStadium also arose in relation to the experts’ valuations of the Training Centre.   The \nfirst issue related to the approach which the Defendants took to identifying the correct \nhypothetical seller and the correct hypothetical purchaser of the Training Centre.  They \nposited that the seller would have to be a person who was not prepared to sell the \nTraining Centre for less than the cost of its construction (whether or not it  was \nresponsible for its original construction) and the purchaser would have to be the owner \nof a football club in Dnipro.  It was suggested that, in such a situation, a prospective \npurchaser would be faced with two alternatives: one to construct its own f acility and \nthe other to pay the seller the cost which they would have to incur in constructing a \nsimilar facility if they had to do it themselves.  \n1451.  As with the case of the Stadium, I agree with the Bank that this is a false basis on which \nto proceed.  The purchaser contemplated by the Defendants would not be a willing \npurchaser, because it has special purchaser status which should be (but on the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n355 \n Defendants hypothesis would not be) disregarded for valuation purposes.  Likewise, the \nseller contemplated by the Defendants would not be a willing seller, because it would \nbe a particular type of seller who has predetermined for extraneous reasons the pri ce at \nwhich it is prepared to sell.  \n1452.  The second  connected issue related to Mr Thomas’ evidence that the highest and best \nuse for the Training Centre (on which he then based his income approach valuation) \nwas as a sports tourism complex with on -site accommodation.  The Defendants \nchallenged Mr Thomas’ view that  the Training Centre fell within the sports tourism \nsector  on the grounds that it was not at the date of valuation being used as a sports \ntourism business , but rather was being used as a training ground for FC Dnipro .  The \nhighest and best use for the Training Centre which had been adopted by both U CE and \nVeritas in their 2015 and 2016 valuations was as a football club training facility .  Veritas \nsaid that the reason for this was that the Training Centre was “a unique specialised \nproperty which was not intended for gaining a profit”.  Mr Howard adopted that highest \nand best use in his cross -examination of Mr Thomas . \n1453.  Mr Kaczmarek took a slightly different line  (although he had referred to the Veritas \nconclusion on this issue earlier in  his own report ).  He said that he disagreed with Mr \nThomas’s view that the highest and best use for the Training Centre  was as a sports \ntourism property , but the real extent of any disparity with Mr Thomas’ opinion was \nunclear because in his view the highest and best use would be as  what he called  “a \nmembership -oriented sports club ” where additional income could be  achieved through \n“one t ime use "}

He therefore \ndiffered both from the position w hich the Defendants  appeared to take  in challenging \nMr Thomas’ evidence  and from Mr Thomas, describing his differences with Mr \nThomas as “very different business models” . \n1454.  Mr Kaczmarek then went on to explain that he considered that far more income could \nbe generated for the training centre if it was marketed to local residents on a \nmembership basis whilst also leasing other assets to both members and non members . \nHe did not consider that tourists to D nipro were the primary target market .  He said \nthat: \n“In this sense, the Training Centr e would operate more akin to a private sporting \nclub where the club would supplement its monthly membership fees from non -\nmembers for the use of its facilities and members for the use of fees on a reservation \nbasis.”  \n1455.  However, although Mr Kaczmarek referred to far more income being generated from \nthe Training Centre if his usage was adopted , he did not then quantify the consequences \nof the difference in view  he had with Mr Thomas .  He did not do so  because he s aid \nthat his opinion on usage  did not cause him to consider that an income approach to \nvaluation based on that use was appropriate .  He said that no studies had been performed \nwhether in 2016 (or at any other time ) to develop a potential cash flow m odel sufficient \nto enable an income approach to be implemented .   On the same point, t he Defendants \nalso submi tted that Mr Thomas’ own approach to an income approach valuation was \nmisguided, because it did not include any actual income data relating to the use of a \nsports centre as a sport tourism complex . \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n356 \n 1456.  It is not in issue that the  Defendants  were correct to say that there was no data \nevidencing the actual inpu ts in relation to the Training Centre, although the Bank \ncontended that the only reason it was not available was that it was not provided by  the \nIndividual Defendants , notwithstanding that it was ultimately owned and c ontrolle d by \nthem .  This inevitably meant that there was uncertainty in relation to the inputs to be \ntaken into account , a consideration which was accepted by Mr Thomas as being relevant  \nto his valuation.  \n1457.  Furthermore, Mr Thomas  also accepted that, as at the date of valuation, the  Training \nCentre  was not being used as part of sports tourism business , but in his view t his did \nnot detract from the fact that  for valuation purposes the  Training Centre ’s usage  was \nbest characterised as a sports tourism complex with on -site accommodation .  On that \nbasis, he  went on to calculate what he called an anticipated profit in the form of  an: \n“operating cash flow generated for a period of 1 year, converted into a capital sum \nby applying a capitalization rate that reflects an adequate return on invested capital \nappropriate for the type of commercial operation and location as of the date of \nvaluation. In accordance w ith this approach, the operating income is defined and \nconsidered as the EBITDA of the asset.

The inputs he used for that purpose were notional figures for the  price charged per \nperson per day for the package of services, including accommodation, offered by the \nTraining Centre and the total number of visitors likely to use these services throughout \nthe year. In the absence of actual information  he determined a median price per person \nper day for that package and a normalised annual occupancy rate by reference to \ncomparable properties . \n1459.  This pricing data was derived from 27 properties in 12 different countries with facilities \ngenerally similar to those of the Training Centre  and led to a conclusion that the median \nprice per person per day for all 27 was UAH 1 ,060 It was driven by general  market \ndemand for sports training and recreation applicable in all countries including Ukraine , \nrather than by specific reference to football.   He also took into account the income \ngenerating value attributable to the on -site accommodation  having regard to data \nrelating to occupancy rates , which he assessed at 65% .  He then deducted assumed \noperating expenses by an analysis of EBITDA profit margins for companies operating \nin comparable emerging markets to reach a 42% EBITDA profit margin which he then \ncapitalised at a rate of 15% .  He accept ed that  there was  uncertainty in relation to his \ninput s but was of the view that  his approach was both reasonable and robust given the \nlimited information available to him.  \n1460.  Mr Kaczmarek’s reliance on the Veritas valuation was based on what he said appeared \nto him to be a proper implementation of the cost approach.   I shall come on to some of \nthe problems with the way that it was implemented, but I also think that there is real \nsubstance in Mr Thomas’s principled rejection of the use of a cost approach in the first \nplace . I think he was right to conclude that the cost approach is generally only applicable \nto the valuation of real property where there is either no evidence of transaction prices \nfor similar property or no identifiable actual or notional income stream and that this \nwas not the case in relation to the Training Centre .  Mr Thomas’ view on this question \nof principle was also supported by  the EY November 2016 Report .  It said about both \nthe valuation used by the Bank  when taking the Training Centre onto its books as part \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n357 \n of the Asset Tran sfers (the UCE valuation) and the  Veritas valuation described as \n“verified by the NBU”  as follows:  “this value calculation must include an income \napproach, as the cost approach does not capture the property’s true market value ”. \n1461.  It was Mr Ka czmarek’s evidence that different valuers might have made different \nassumptions, but said that nothing in his review of the work  done by  Veritas  suggested \nthat their parameters were unreasonable.  He also said that Veritas had maximised the \nuse of observable inputs “drawing wherever possible on historical cost information \nrelated to the valuation object itself”.  For this reason he concluded that it was \nunsurprising that the NBU chose to approve the Training Centre valuation report \nproduced by V eritas.   The Bank did not accept that the NBU had approved the Veritas \nreport in the sense assumed by Mr Kaczmarek, and for that reason his reliance on what \nthe NBU had done was inappropriate but, irrespective of that,  one of the more striking \naspects of Veritas’ (and therefore Mr Kaczmarek’s) application of the costs approach \nwas that, on its own terms, it provided little certainty i"}

In this context, the Bank mounted a sustained attack on the exercise which Veritas itself \nhad carried out . The figures Veritas had used for the original construction costs were \nwholly notional and were derived from what Mr Thomas called  “cost estimates derived \nusing statistics taken from a Soviet -era cost manual produced by the State Committee \nof the USS R Council of Ministers for Construction in 1969 ” known as the UPVV , \nwhich were then indexed to the dat e of valuation in 2016 .  In Mr Thomas’  view there \nwere  many problems with this approach.  They included the fact that  the original costs \nfigures were entirely notional  and were based on parameters relevant to a Soviet \ncommunist economy in 1969 which bears  no relation to a Ukrainian market economy \nin 2016 (25 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union) .  Veritas also omitted  from \ntheir indexation tables a period of six or seven years between 1984 and 1991.  \n1463.  Other aspects of the Veritas cost approach which were criticised by the Bank included  \nthe addition of a developer profit of 2 6% and the manner in which the Marshall & Swift \ndepreciation tables were used to depreciate the assets  to which the cost approach was \nbeing applied.  One example of a surprising approach to depreciation drawn out in \ncross -examination of Mr Kaczmarek was that there were some assets in respect of \nwhich their 44 year actual term of use was 4 years in excess of their 40 year regulatory \nterm of use, but they were only depreciated by 30%.   It was also clear from Mr \nKaczmarek’s evidence that the Veritas report made no assessment of the highest and \nbest use for the Training Centre and did not account for economic o bsolescence .  He  \nexplained this omission on the basis that Veritas may have considered that the facilities \nwere in very good shape , but I find it difficult to accept that evidence (which the Bank \ncriticised as being partisan and self -serving) on the basis that there was no indication in \ntheir report that this was a view they in fact took.  \n1464.  Having regard to all of these considerations, I consider that  the evidence adduced from \nMr Thomas is to be preferred to that adduced from Mr Kaczmarek , based as it was on \nhis adoption of the Veritas report.  There is no doubt that there was a significant degree  \nof uncertainty in Mr Thomas ’s valuation, but I am satisfied that he adopted the correct \nmethodology for estimating a fair market value at the time of the Asset Transfers, and \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n358 \n that the inputs he use d were reasonable for the valuation he carried out based on the \nusage he assume d and sufficiently robust to support his conclusion . \n1465.  I therefore find that the value of the Training Centre at the date of the Asset Transfers \nwas the figure attributed by Mr Thomas : UAH 104,919,540 . That is the figure arising \nout of the transfer of the Training Centre  for which the Bank must give credit in its \nclaim against the Defendants for the losses which it sustained in consequence of the \nMisappropriation.  \n \nAsset Transfers: value of the Airfield  \n1466.

The credit value attributed to the Airfield  was UAH 366 million  (i.e. its Original 2016 \nValue), which was based on  a report prepared by UCE in 2015  applying a  market and \nincome  approach to the value of the Airfield as  at 18 June  2015 .  Its Restated 2016 \nValue, assessed as at 31 December 2016 in a report prepared by Asset Expertise  in \nFebruar y 2019 was UAH 3.6 million; Asset Expertise  adopted what it called a \ncombined comparable and income approach for its valuation.  The value attributed to it \nby the Bank’s  expert (Mr Thomas ) was UAH 5.7 million  as at a valuation date of 6 June \n2016, being the date of transfer to the Ban k, using a weighted  market and income \napproach .  The value attributed to it by Mr Kolomoisky’s expert (Mr Kaczmarek), was \nUAH 34 million.  He based his opinion on a report prepared by Kreston GCC Advisors \nLLC (“Kreston”)  dated 5 August 2016 which valued the Airfield  as at 1 July 2016 and \napplied a cost approach.  This figure was also described in the EY November 2016 \nReport as the NBU verified  figure .  The difference between the parties’ respective \nvaluations was therefore UAH 28 million and the amount by which the Bank claimed \nthat the credit value exceeded its true value was UAH 360 million.   It is striking that \nthe UCE report was wildly in excess of the other valuations, and the valuation it gave \nwas rejected by both experts.  \n1467.  Mr Thomas said that the description of this asset as the Airfield was a misnomer , \nalthough he continued to refer to it as such to avoid confusion .  He said that the assets \nwhich comprise the “Airfield” are a series of 33 buildings situated on two land plots .  \nThe buildings  were described as being in poor, satisfactory or (in one instance) good \ncondition .  The land on which the warehouses were located did not function as an \noperational airfield at the valuation date and had not done so for more than a decade .  \nThe Government land cadast re disclose d that the ownership and property rights  in the \nland belong to  the regional government, Dnipropetrovsk District State Administration.   \n1468.  There are tw o main issues which arise .  The first is that Mr Thomas  limited his  valuation \nto the buildings  and the land beneath the buildings , and excl uded the remaining land on \nthe site which was not transferred to the Bank .  Mr Kaczmarek took a different approach \nbecause his valuation included a figure attributable to the whole of the two plots of land \non which the buildings were situated .  In large part this difference in approach explains \nthe differences in the valuations of the two experts.  \n1469.  Mr Thomas’ explanation for his position was that, although both the buildings \nthemselves and what he called the usage rights of the land beneath the m were \ntransf erred to the Bank and could be transferred on to a new o wner as part of a sale, he \nconsidered that it was unlikely that the usage and ownership rights to the additional  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n359 \n land on which the buildings did not sit could be transferred .

These usage rights were not transferred or transfer able to \nthe Bank . \n1470.  Mr Kaczmarek took a different view , because he said that it was reasonable to conclude \nthat there was inherent value associated with the land  plots as a whole , not least because \nit would appear to be impossible to construct improvements on the land if the land use \nrights were not owned or possessed .  That strikes me as being a rather circular argument . \nIt is not at all obvious wh y that is the case given the extent of the land not covered with \nbuildings even if they are spread out .  It also ignores that what matters for present \npurposes (and indee d the purposes for which the contemporaneous valuations were \ncarried out) is the extent of the property actually mortgaged t o the Bank as part of the \nAsset Transfers , and in respect of which the Bank as mortgagee would be able to \nexercise ownership  rights  on enforcement of its security .  He also said that any issue as \nto the extent of the rights was inconsistent with the contemporaneous valuations in \nwhich both Kreston (in 2016) and later in the year EY gave value to th ose land use \nrights.  \n1471.  The experts agree d that the ownership of the land other than the land under the buildings \nthemselves is a factual matter , and ultimately not a matter for them .  I take the same \nview. In my view , the best and most relevant evidence is to be found in the terms of the \nmortgage agreement  pursuant to which the Bank acquired its rights over the Airfield as \npart of the Asset Transfer s.  This agreement  makes a clear distinction between  what it \ncalls the Mortgaged Propert y (clause 7)  on the one hand  and the two  plots of land  on \nwhich the Mortgaged Proper ty was situated (clause 8)  on the other .  This other land \ncovered a substantially greater total area  (139.1037 hectares divided into 2 separate \nplots of 137.96 hectares and 1.1437 hectares) than the area of land on which the \nbuildings comprising the Mortgage d Property w ere constructed .  Mr Thomas said that \nthe built land  amounted to only 4,520 square metres, i.e. less than half a hectare . \n1472.  The propert y charged to the Bank,  which is the subject matter of the mortgage \nagreement , is (as it name implies) the paragraph 7 “Mortgaged Property ”.  It is \ndescribed as a complex at the Airfield address , registered as separate , demarcated \nproperty with its own immovable property registration number .  The other land is \ndescribed in paragraph 8 as being the  two land plot s with two separate  cadastre number s \non which the Mortgaged Property is situated .  It is not itself Mortgaged Pr operty as \ndefined .  This emphasises the distinction  of two  separate properties, each with their own  \nseparate regist rations,  only one of which was transferred as Mortgaged Property.   It is \nexpressly provided that “no other pledge shall be given hereunder” .  It follows that the \nland on the Airfield other than the complex of buildings falling within the definition of \nMortgaged Property was not effectively transferred to the Bank as security under the \nterms of the mortgage agreement.   \n1473.  However, t he mortgagor also ha d rights to use those parts of the land  at the Airfield site \nwhich were not part of the Mortgaged Propert y pursuant to the terms of the lease \nagreement s with the local authority.

For that reason alone, the Kreston valuation (and its adoption by Mr \nKaczmarek) is deeply flawed  because it values an asset which I find not to have been \nthe subject of an effective transfer to the Bank . \n1474.  In any event, even if that were to be wrong, it is impossible to tell from the Kreston \nvaluation how the valuers went about quantifying the prospective rental stream from \nthe whole of the Airfield , which was the method they used for valuing the land usage \nrights .  While Kreston calculated a rental value per square metre of warehouse space  \nwhich  they regarded as comparable to the buildings on the Airfield, it is not clear how \nthey then quantified the value per hectare of the unbuilt land.  Mr Akkouh suggeste d in \nhis cross -examination of Mr Kaczmarek that the value for the whole site was assessed  \nby reference to the rental value per square metre of warehouse  space , which would have \nbeen absurd , because only a very small proportion of the total area was built on .  I am \nnot convinced that the assumption on which this part of his cross -examination was \nbased is correct, but it is striking that although Mr Kaczmarek had adopted the Kreston \nreport as his own evidence, he was unable to explain what they had in fact do ne. \n1475.  The second main issue has a much more  limited impact (just short of UAH 2 million) \non the valuation .  The disagreement was  whether to adopt a weighted market and \nincome approach, which is the approach adopted by Mr Thomas having determined that \nthe highest and best use for the buildings was warehouse storage, or a cost approach \nwhich is adopted by  Mr Kaczmarek , based  on the Kreston report .  A similar  divergence \nof view in relation to the application of the cost approach arose in relation to the Airfield \nas had arisen in relation to the Stadium  and the Training Centre.  \n1476.  It was Mr Kaczmarek’s position that there was insufficient information to implement \nthe income approach and that the cost approach was to be preferred be cause it was \nreliant on more observable inputs than the income approach .  Mr Kaczmarek gained \nsupport from the EY November 2016 Report, because they said that  they thought that \nthe cost approach with an asset depreciation test should  have  been used as the primary \nbasis for the valuation. Indeed t hey the n went on to say that the Kreston report may \nhave subst antially understated the fair value of the land use rights , i.e. the full 137.96 \nhectares and not just the buildings : \n\"In our view, the value estimate for the land found by capitalising additional \nincome in Report 2 [Kreston Report], should have been double checked using the \nsales comparables approach to ensure it matched up to market prices. Our desk \nreview looked at sal es prices for similar plots of land on the market. We did not \nmake an assessment and did not make detailed calculations, but we want to note \nthat the market price range for farm land is 1.4 - 4.6 dollars per square metre and \nindustrial use - 1.6 - 3.6 doll ars per square metre (for areas with comparable \nlocation and size).

Mr Kaczmarek’s opinion was that, because there was no historic income or cost date \nfrom the property itself, and because there was no evidence as to whether or not \nproperty -specific data would cause an increase or decrease in an income based \nvaluation, Mr Thomas’s valuation was notional and could not give rise to a sufficient \nlevel of confidence to establish what he called a compliant fair value measurement.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n361 \n 1478.  Mr Thomas  said that th e income  approach was  justifiable because the buildings , which \nwas all he thought it appropriate to value,  were capable of generating a n identifiable \nincome stream in the form of observable market inputs , while the market approach was \nalso justifiable because the assets being valued were very common and there was a \nsubstantial  market for their sale and rental , utilising their highest and best use .  The \nmarket approach assessed the rental stream from five assets with a similar location and \nin a similar physical condition and, adjusting for matters such as the surface area of the \ncomparable , gave rise to a valuation of UAH 6.15 million .  The income approach was \nderived from a comparables -based median rental value of c.UAH 19 per sq m per month \nand arrived at a figure of UAH 5.41 million after appropriate adjustments and \ncapitalisation .  His final weighted valuation attributed 40% fr om the results of the \nmarket approach and 60% f rom the results of the income approach.  \n1479.  I think that Mr Thomas’ assessment  was based on sufficientl y reliable input data and I \nprefer his evidence on this issue.  It seems to me that the more commonplace the asset, \nthe higher the level of confidence the valuer can have in the use of market -based input \nfigures , thereby making less significant the fact that actual figures for the historic use \nof the relevant building may not be available .  I also think that it is possible to take into \naccount ( without relying on it in its own right) that in the event the Airfield was sold at \nauction in  August 2020 for a figure of UAH 6.2 million . \n1480.  I also consider that, even if a cost approach were to have been the best way of making \na reliable valuation  of those parts of the Airfield which were transferred to the Bank as \npart of the Asset Transfer s, the evidence demonstrates that the way in which Kreston \n(and therefore Mr Kaczmarek ) used the cost estimates suffered from the same \ndeficiencies as the costs approach relating to the Training Centre.  In short I think that \nas with the Training Centre, Mr Thomas was justified in his opinion that “I do not \nconsider that the parameters on which the UPVV cost estimates are based provide a \nreliable comparable to the market costs that would have existed in the (free market) \neconomy in Ukraine in 2016 ”. \n1481.  I therefore find that the best evidence supports the Ban k’s case that the value of the \nAirfield at the date of the Asset Transfers was the figure attributed by Mr Thomas : UAH \n5,708,758 .  That is the figure arising out of the transfer of the Airfield for which the \nBank must give credit in its claim a gainst the Defendants for the losses which it \nsustained in consequence of the Misappropriation.  \n \nAsset Transfers: value of the Aircraft  \n1482.

The credit value s (i.e., the Original 2016 Values ) attributed to the nine aircraft totalled  \nUS$163 million.  This appears to have been based  on nine reports prepared in  August \n2016 by Veritas , which the experts called by the Bank and Mr Kolomoisky both said \nwere unreliable  because of the methodology and dat a inputs which were used.  The \nvalue attributed to the  nine aircraft  by the Bank’s expert (Ms Razzhivina ) was U S$69 \nmillion.   The value attributed to them  by Mr Kolomoisky’s expert (Mr Seymour ), was \nUS$84 million.  The difference between the parties’ respective valuations was therefore \nUS$15 million and the amount by which the Bank claimed that the credit value \nexceeded  their true value was U S$94 million.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n362 \n 1483.  In the section of this judgment concerned with the ownership of the Transferred Assets  \n(see in particular paragraphs 1192 ff above)  I have already described  how the  nine \naircraft were sold to the Bank by Pers er and the n immediately sold on  by the Bank to \nDilorsano .  It is the Bank’s position that the whole transaction was collusive because \nboth Perser and Dilorsano were companies owned and controlled by the Individual \nDefendants and the net benefit to the Bank was limited to the sum of US$ 12,336,440 , \nwhich was the full extent of the repayment of principal actually made by Dilorsano as \nat 16 June 2023 .  The Bank’s case is therefore that the transfer of the nine aircraft only \nreduced its l oss by US$ 12,336,440 and not by the credit  value o f US$163 million \nderived from the nine Veritas reports.  \n1484.  I agree with the Bank’s submission on this point .  I am satisfied that  the agreement s \nbetween  Perser and the Bank and between  the Bank and Dilorsano w ere not part of a \ngenuine arm’s length transaction but were in fact part of a collusive arrangement  \nbetween connected parties , which purported to b e a genuine mechanism for reducing \nthe indebtedness to the Bank under the Relevant Loans , but which in fact left the Bank \nwith rights against Dilorsano which were never worth more tha n a fraction of the true \nvalue of the nine aircraft themselves.  In circumstances in which the terms of the \nagreement between the Bank and Dilorsano took the form which it did , the true value \nof that which  the Bank  received from the transaction as a whole was only ever the value \nof the rights which i t had against Dilorsan o.  The best evidence of the value of those \nright s as at the time of the Asset Transfers is the amount of principa l which the Bank \nhas been able to recover from Dilorsano . \n1485.  In case I am wrong about that, I should explain my conclusion as to th e true value of \nthe nine aircraft at that time .  Of the nine aircraft, two were manufactured by Airbus, \nfour were manufactured  by Boeing and three were manufactured by Embraer .  By the \nconclusion of the evidence, there was no dispute as to the value of the four Boe ings.  \nRelatively early on (viz., b y the time of the expert’s second joint statement ), the value \nof Boeing 767 (MSN 25280)  had been agreed  by the part ies at the figure assessed by \nMr Seymour (US$5.99 million) .  Rather later (viz., at  the beginning of  Ms Razz hivina’s \ncross -examination ), Mr Howard  announced that Mr Kolomoisky accepted her \nvaluations of the other Boeing 767 aircraft: MSN 28659  at a figure of US $3.75 million, \nMSN 25533 at a figure of US$8.85 million and MSN  25536 at a figure of US$8.27 \nmillion.

The dispute was then limited to the two Airbus es and the three Embraers \neach of which was valued by Ms Razzhivinia at a lower figure than the figure reached \nby Mr Seymour.  \n1486.  Before explaining my findings in relation to the true value of the three E mbraers , I note \nthat the Individual Defendants must have known that now-agreed value of  US$17.12 \nmillion for  two of the Boeing aircraft ( MSN 25533 and MSN 25536 ) is very \nsubstantially less than the aggregate of the Original 2016 Values  given to MSN 25533 \nand MSN 25536, which was US$58 million.  The reason for this is that  Pennylane’s \nfinancial statement s for the year ended 31 December 2015  disclosed that the average \nvalue  of its six Boeing aircraft, which included MSN 25533 and MSN 25536 , was just \nover US$12 million  each.  Although the US$12 million figure , of which the Individual \nDefendants will have been aware from Pennylane’s financial statements , is materially  \nhigher than the true value of US$8.85 million and US$8.27 million for MSN 25533 and \nMSN 25536  respectively , it is very substantially less  than the Original 2016 Values  of \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n363 \n US$24.9 million given to  MSN 25533 and US$33 million given to MSN 25536  (see \nthe two relevant Dilorsano sale agreement s referred to in paragraph 1195  above ). \n1487.  Mr Seymour and Ms Razzhiv ina agreed that the correct  methodology for valuing an \naircraft has a number of stages.  The first is to establish the base value of an aircraft of \nthe age and type being valued  on the assumption that it had a base specification.  The \nconcept of base value is itself described by the International Society of Transport \nAircraft  Trading (“ISTAT”) as follows:  \n“Base Value is the Appraiser ’s opinion of the underlying economic value of an \naircraft in an open, unrestricted, stable market environment with a reasonable \nbalance of supply and demand, and assumes full consideration of its “highest and \nbest use” . An aircraft’s Base Value is founded in the historical trend of values and \nin the projection of value trends and presumes an arm’s -length, cash transaction \nbetween willing, able and knowledgeable parties, acting prudently, with an absence \nof duress and wit h a reas onable period of time available for marketing. In most \ncases, the Base Value of an aircraft assumes its physical condition is average for \nan aircraft of its type and age, and its maintenance time status is at mid -life, mid -\ntime (or benefiting from an above -average maintenance status if it is new or nearly \nnew, as the case may be). ” \n1488.  Ms Ra zzhivina described this first stage as requiring the collection and analysis of \naircraft trans action data to produce a normalised value for a generic aircraft of the type \nbeing value d with a base specification.  It also requires the valuer to assume that , as at \nthe valuation date , the aircraft is in what is called “hal f-life” maintenance condition, \ni.e., that its major modules ( airframe, engines, landing gear  and auxiliary power unit) \nare at an assumed mid -point interval between  their next scheduled inspection or \noverhaul.  \n1489.  The next stage is to adjust that base value  so as to reflec t any differences as between \nthe base specification and the specification of the actual aircraft being valued.

The next stage is to adjust that base value  so as to reflec t any differences as between \nthe base specification and the specification of the actual aircraft being valued.   Ms \nRazzhivina said that this led to  a half-life retrospective market value of the aircraft.  The \nthird stage is to make a further adjustment to take account  of where the major \ncomponents of the aircraft are in their maintenance cycle.  \n1490.  The differences in value reached by Mr Seymour and Ms Razzhivina are in large part  \nattributable to the first stage of the analysis , i.e., their assessment of the base value of \neach of the two Airbuses and each of the three Embrae r aircraft.   There were the n \nrelativel y small adjustments made by Ms Razzhivina to reach the half -life market \nvalues .   The figures the two experts  reached for the  five aircr aft threw up an aggregate \ndiffere ntial of US$14.53  million  for the half -life market values for all five  of the \naircraft , broken down as follows:  \ni) Airbus (MSN 2462) , manufactured 2005 : Ms Razz hivina: US18. 1 million. Mr \nSeymour US$24 .01 million.  Difference: US$5. 91 million.  \nii) Airbus (MSN 2 682), manufactured 2006 : Ms Razzhivina: US $20 million. Mr \nSeymour US$2 5.45 million.  Difference: US$5. 45 million . \niii) Embraer (MSN 145-250), manufactured 2000 : Ms Razzhivina: US$ 1.7 million. \nMr Seymour US$2 .69 million.  Difference: US$ 0.99 million.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n364 \n iv) Embraer  (MSN 145 -290), manufactured 2000 : Ms Razzhivina: US$1.7 million. \nMr Seymour US$2.69 million.  Difference: US$0.99 million.  \nv) Embraer (MSN 145 -394), manufactured 2001 : Ms Razzhivina: US$1.7 million. \nMr Seymour US$2. 89 million.  Difference: US$ 1.19 million.  \n1491.  The remain ing difference s between the  experts  flowed from a disagreement as to  the \nappropriate extent of the maintenance adjustment , in respect of which the experts were \nUS$1.15 million apart  for all five aircraft and an adjustment to reflect damage done to \nAirbus (MSN 2462 ) in respect of which Ms Razzhivina applied a figure of US$1.87 \nmillion while Mr Seymour made no adjustment.  \n1492.  One of the issue s with the evidence relating to the base value of the five aircraft is th at \nthe source of the information on which each of the exp erts relied for their respective \nopinions could not be fully tested  because of the form in which it was presented .  In \ntheir joint statement Ms Razzhivina and Mr Seymour  explained that they had both relied \non confidential and public data points in conducting their valuations , that those data \npoints were available to them as at August 2016 (i.e., as at the valuation date), and that \nthe use of these published values prevented the influence  of hindsight.  \n1493.  Both experts also said that, a lthough based in some part on undisclosed confidential \ninformation, t hey or their organisations had both published the ir initial values in August \n2016 : Ms Razzhi vina via the Oriel online valuation system  and Mr Seymour via IBA’s \nAircraft Values Book.   They also both agreed that  each expert was individually \nresponsible for collecting market data points and that , because the market data points \non which they relied w ere confidential , they would each have relied on a different set \nof data which may have led to th ose differences in values.  \n1494.  The Bank submitted that Ms Razzhivina’s evidence on this point was more reliable \nbecause she had provided much more information about the data points which underlay \nher published values.  She also explained  that she based her opinion on what she called \ncontemporaneous transactional data relating to the "}

The Bank submitted that Ms Razzhivina’s evidence on this point was more reliable \nbecause she had provided much more information about the data points which underlay \nher published values.  She also explained  that she based her opinion on what she called \ncontemporaneous transactional data relating to the sale and leases of specific types of \naircraft which then enabled her to plot data points against the age of the aircraft.  An \nappendix to her report gives a  detailed analysis of what those  contemporaneous data \npoints  comprised .  She identified  eleven  for the Airbus  aircraft and cross checked them \nagainst six post-dated transactional data points , three of which we re public and three of \nwhich were confidential.   She identified four for the Embraer.  However, although \ndetailed, much of this data cannot itself be cross checked, because it comes from both \npublic and confidential sources and was therefore anonymised in her report so that it \ncould not be related to an actual sale.   \n1495.  Mr Seymour took a d ifferent approach , accepting in his report that he had not provided \nthe same level of detail as to the various data points used for each valuation “since the \nfindings of our research and analysis were published as a single resultant figure in the \nrelevant edition of our Aircraft Values Book”.  In fact the relevant appendix to his report \nis in a very abbreviated form,  the substance of which was only a single page .  He \naccepted in cross -examination that he had not give n any details of the pricing \ninformation he had looked at and that there was nothing which the court  could \ninterrogate to assess the validity of the data .  He also had no real explanation for why \nhe could not have done what Ms Razzhivina did and anonymise the dat a if, as appeared \nto be the case , he was concerned about maintaining confidentiality .  Instead , he just \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n365 \n presented a generic summary which had limited  evidential value because there was \ninsufficient information to correlate the data poi nts to any of the five aircraft.  \n1496.  The closest that Mr Seymour got to any particularisation in relation to the Airbus \naircraft was as follows:  \n“My colleagues at IBA were in regular communication with the trading community \nand lessors in 2016 and those opinions were that Airbus A321 -200s between the \nages of 10 and 12 years were trading for between US$23,500,000 and \nUS$28,000,000 depending on maint enance condition. ” \n1497.  This is obviously unsatisfactory evidence for a number of reasons, including the fact \nthat it is hearsay , which could not be tested in cross -examination.   He also accepted that \nwhat it boiled down to was that he had a good company and the court should trust that \nhe had got it right.   I do not think that this is a very compelling basis on which to \nconclude that his evidence was to be preferred  over that of Ms Razzhivina , although I \nalso accept that the confidentiality issues to which I have already referred  has an adverse \nimpact on the weight which can be attributed to her opinion as well.  \n1498.  In their closing submi ssions , couns el for Mr Kolomoisky gave a number of reasons  \nother th an the consequences of the underlying data being confidential as to why Ms \nRazzhivin a’s data points were unsatisfactory.  It was said that the ages of some of the \nAirbus aircraft to which her data points related were not comparable  to those which \nwere the subject matter of the experts’ valuation s.  It was also said that all but one  of \nMs Razzhivina’s  data points gave either higher values than those provided in the IBA \nmaterials or values which were largely consistent with them.

Indeed, s he accepted that  \nsome of  the data points she described were in line with IBA values , and that some of \nthe data points provided a wide range for the age of the aircraft and their values , which \nmade comparison with other transac tions very difficult .  All of this was evidence which \nprovides some substance to the submission that Mr Seymour’s values are to be \npreferred.  It was also said against Ms Razzhivina that the uncertainty around the values \nfor sales in 2016  affected her use of a depreciation curve for the purposes of reaching \nher Asset Transfers valuation.  \n1499.  Of these points, the most telling challenge to Ms Razzhivina’s evidence  would  have \nbeen any correlation  between her data points and the IBA valuations relied on by Mr \nSeymour.   However, I do not think that the evidence makes out Mr Kolomoisky’s \nsubmission on this issue .  It would certainly be accurate to say  (as Ms Razzhivina \naccepted in cross -examination) that some of her data points gave values that were \nhigher than or consistent with the IBA values , but it does not demonstrate , as Mr \nKolomoisky said it d id, that it was “all but one” which fell into this category .  \nFurthermore, Ms Razzhivina al ways qualified her answer by explaining that market \nvalue was supposed to ignore the increase in value attributable to aircraft with a lease \nattached , which was the case with several of the IBA numbers .  The Bank also \ndemonstrated in a paper handed up during the course of its oral closing submissions \nthat the table relied on in support of Mr Kolomoisky’s argument on this point  was \nincomplete , in that (a) it did not include a number of data points where it could not be \nsaid that they were in line with the IBA values  and (b) it sought to treat some of Ms \nRazzhivina  data points as more comparable  to the IBA  values  than was in fact the case.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n366 \n 1500.  Turning to the three Embraer aircraft, the differences in relation to the half -life market \nvalues are less substantial.  In the case of these aircraft as well, it is significant that Ms \nRazzhivina’s data points were more detailed than those given by Mr Sey mour, although \nduring the course of her cross -examination it became apparent that two of them were \nnot particularly helpful; one because it post -dated the valuation date and the other \nbecause it was a price implied from a lease not a sale.  I also agree th at, ignoring the \nimpact of a lease (as explained above in relation to the Airbus aircraft) the remaining \ndata points she used were more consistent with Mr Seymour’s half -life market values \nthan her own.  \n1501.  However, I also accept that it would be over -simplistic to conclude that Ms \nRazzhivina’s surviving data points were consistent with the IBA figures.  That is only \npartially right because it ignored the fact that for data points two and four the \nsubmissions  on behalf of Mr Kolomoisky compared the top end of Ms Razzhivina’s \nrange to the bottom end of Mr Seymour’s.  It is also striking that those submissions \nconcentrate on picking holes in Ms Razzhivina’s evidence, rather than addressing why \nit was that Mr Sey mour’s evidence was intrinsically more reliable.

It is said that Ms \nRazzhivina did not express any disagreement with the base values set out in the IBA \nAircraft Value Book, but that is a submission of only limited value because, as she \nexplained in relati on to the Airbus and the Embraer aircraft, she was not asked to \nconsider IBA’s base values.  \n1502.  All of this illustrates that there is considerable uncertainty in both experts’ assess ments \nof the correct half -life market value for the  aircraft .  But taken in the round , I found  Ms \nRazzhivina’s evidence to be more compelling than that of Mr Seymou r.  In reaching \nthat conclusion I also had regard to the fact  (alluded to in paragraph 1232  above)  that \non a number of aspects of his valuation , Mr Seymour accepted as part of the process of \nagreeing the joint statement that he had made some fairly basi c errors in relation to his \noriginal assessment of the half -life value of the aircraft and that to that extent his \noriginal figures were wrong .  These included a failure to  value by reference to the title \nengines  rather than fitted engines of one of the Bo eings and two of the Embraer aircraft, \nand a failure to apply accepted industry practice of assuming that where the condition \nof an aircraft compo nent is unknown, the valuer should assume that it is in a half -life \ncondition . \n1503.  These  errors , which included  a number of other problems with his valuation corrected \nduring the course of agreeing the joint statement , meant that adjustments of several \nhundred thousand US $ were required to his original opinion.   The fact that he had made \nthe errors in the first place undermined my confidence in the reliability of his evidence.  \n1504.  This leaves two other variables . The first is a reduction  for stigma of damage in relation \nto one of the Airbus aircraft (where the difference between the experts was US$1.87 \nmillion , Mr Seymour being of the view that no reduction was required ).  The second is \na maintenance adjustment where the difference between the experts is US$654,000  for \nthe Airbus (MSN 2462)  and significantly smaller figures for the other Airbus (MSN \n2682 ) and the three Embraer aircraft, all four of which were within what the experts \naccepted was a reasonable range of difference.  \n1505.  As to the damage, the Airbus was hit by a ramp truck in September 2010 resulting in a \n5 metre hole in its fuselage.   It was accept ed by Mr Seymour that this constituted really \nserious damage affecting a pressurised area and the primary structure of the aircraft .  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n367 \n He also agreed that anyway in theory major carriers would want to steer well clear of \nplanes with a substantial damage history, although he gave an example of one instance \nin which  a major airline did not take that approach on the grounds that it was not going \nto impede its ability to earn revenue .  He accepted  that a normal range of adjustment \nfrom the adjusted aircraft value  was between 0% and 30% depending on whether the \ndamage was to a pressurised or unpressurised part of the plane , whether it was to a \nprimary , secondary or tertiary  part of the  structure and whether it was in an area likely \nto suffer further damage .  Although his initial view was that no reduction was \nappropriate, w hen pressed, he accep ted that a reduction of somewhere in the region of \n1% to 2%  would be justif ied.  \n1506.

This is \nobviously a matter on which  views can properly differ, but having read th e AMS  report, \nI can see why the damage was characterised as serious.

On this \npoint I take the view  that Ms Razzhivina’s evidence is more realistic. I find that a proper \nreduction for stigma of damage  to this Airbus aircraft was 10%. \n1507.  As to the mainten ance adjustm ents, the only one of any real significance is the \ndifferential of US$654,000 in relation to the negative maintenance adjustment for the \nAirbus’ second engine .  Ms Ra zzhivina’s assessment was US1.58 million while Mr \nSeymour’s was US$701,000 .  There are respectable arguments both ways on this point , \nbut if it were to be the case that the Bank was required to give credit to the Defendants \narising out of the value of the Aircraft, I would have preferred Ms Razzhivina’s \nevidence.  I n my judgment the amount for which credit should have been given if I had \nnot accepted the Bank’s submissions in relation to Dilorsano which I have explained in \nparagraphs 1483 ff above would have US$ 69,270,131 . \n \nUnlawful conduct of the Individual Defendants: Article 1166  \n1508.  The unlawful conduct on which the Bank relies is that the Individual Defendants used \ntheir control over the Bank to procure the misappropriation of US$1,911,877,385 from \nthe Bank in the form of the Relevant Drawdowns, made under the Relevant Loans.  It \nis said that they caused the Bank to grant the Relevant Loans to the Borrowers, in a \nmanner that was flagrantly contrary to the Bank’s basic lending procedures, in spit e of \nthe Borrowers’ lack of credit or trading history and obvious inability to repay the su ms \nloaned to them, and for the purpose of misappropriating monies from the Bank.  \n1509.  It is also submitted that causing or procuring t he subsequent transfer of the Relevant \nDrawdowns back and forth between Borrowers and Suppliers culminating in the \nconclusion of the RSAs and the making of the Unreturned Prepayments, together with \nother measures to conceal the Misappropriation, gave rise to clear breaches of duty \nunder Ukrainian law.  These other measures inc luded authorising the preparation of \nextensive, often backdated sham paperwork, such as the LFSAs, Share Pledges and \ndocuments in support of the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings, the imprope r grant of the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n368 \n Intermediary Loans and the New Loans and the alteration of the Borrowers’ nominee \narrangements in an effort to conceal their affiliation with the Individual  Defendants.  \n1510.  This conduct was said to be unlawful because it deprived  the Bank  of its  monies in a \nmanner not provided for by the laws of Ukraine contrary to Article 3(1)(2)  and it \nviolated  the Bank’s rights with an intention to injure the Bank and the exercise of their \nrights in an abusive manner contrary to Article 13 .  It also amounted to a breach of what \nare generally treated in Ukraine as being fiduciary duties: a failure to act in good faith \nand in the best interests of the Bank by causing the Bank to enter into pu rported \nagreements which were not in its best interests contrary to Articles 92, Article 63 and \nArticle 42 , a failure  to comply wit"}

I agree that , to the extent that the Individual Defendants procured, assisted or \nparticipated in  any of the elements of the Misapp ropriation referred to, the y will  have \ncommitted  serious breaches of  all of the  fiduciary dut ies, which was the way in which \nthe Bank concentrated in putting its case in closing .  In that regard , it is clear that both \nof the Individual Defendants were ‘officers’ of the Bank for the purposes of the JSC \nLaw, because they were members of the Supervisory Board throughout the relevan t \nperiod.   They were therefore obliged, pursuant to Article 63(1) to “act in the interests \nof the company, follow the requirements of the law, provisions of the charter and other \ndocuments of the company”.  \n1512.  I accept the Bank’s case that the evidence supports a clear finding that the Individual \nDefendants both controlled the Bank and the other Relevant Entities and that the nature \nand extent of their control was such as to enable them  to procure the planning , \nimplementation and operation of both the loan recycling scheme and the \nMisappropriation should they have wished to do so .  The Bank has established its case \nthat the members of the ECC who approved the Relevant Loans were loyal to and in \nclose communication with the Individual Defendants  in the relevant period, and have \nremained loyal to  them ever since . \n1513.  I also accept the Bank’s case that it is inconceivable that those directly involved would \nhave approved either the Relevant Loans or the making of the Relevant Drawdowns  \nwithout the Individual Defendants’  instructions to d o so, more particular ly where the \nRelevant Entities  were all controlled by them as well .  The same can be said about the \nBOK and PBC employees who arranged and participated in the Relevant Drawdowns . \nI agree that t he notion that they  were made to the Borrowers without instruction from \nthe Individual Defendants is unsustainable . The findings I have already made about the \nIndividual Defendants’ control of the Relevant Entities, and the unlikelihood of the \nBank’s employees embarking on this scheme without their active approval and consent, \nmeans that it is inherently unlikely  that any of the steps in the Misappropriation were \nnot known and approved by both of them.  \n1514.  There is little direct evidence to this effect, but the circumstantial evidence is \ncompelling, more particularly when combined with the adverse inferences I draw from \ntheir failure to give evidence and attend for cross -examination.   Amongst the many \nother matters I have summarise d in this judgment, t hat circumstantial evidence includes \ntheir more than 90% ownership of the Bank, the roles which they both performed in the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n369 \n Bank, the way in which the Bank was structured , the departure from the Bank of the \nemployees to whom they were closest at the time of nationalisa tion and the widespread \nexten t of related party lending by the Bank . \n1515.

I cannot reach such a  clear conclusion on the precise extent to which each of  the \nIndividual Defendants was  consulted on the making of each of the Relevant Loans, but \nI think it is more likely than not that they were , albeit it is quite possible that they \ndelegated  to others the ability to give specific  instructions and authorit y to make \nRelevant Loans, such to b e conveyed to the ECC  (or possibly the Management Board) \nby others .  However, the mere giving of the instructions to act in that manner while \nleavi ng the detail of what was to be done is itself a breach of duty, albeit without specific \nconsequ ences until such time as the instructions are impl emented.  \n1516.  I have reached the conclusions I have  on the Individual Defendants’  role, in part \nbecause of the finding s I have made  about the benefits which they and their other \nbusinesses ultimately received from the Misappropriation, but it is also clear to me that \nsuch a conclusion is justified by the very nature of a loan recycling scheme  being \noperated for the purposes of extracting foreign currency from Ukraine .  Decisions about \nthe need for the extraction of money as part of what was on any view  a foreign currency \nrelated money laundering scheme are likely to have come from them as and when \nmonies were required.  \n1517.  However, even if that were not to be the case in relation to each of the Relevant Loans, \nI have little doubt that the implementation of the scheme on a day -to-day basis only \noccurred with their general approval and consent.  Every time a Relevant Loan was \nagreed or a Relevant Drawdown was made, implementation only occurred because the \nparticipating individuals within the Bank, Primecap and PBC knew and believed that \nthey were acting with the consent and approval of the Individual Defendants , which \nthey were , not least because the Individual Defendants knew and intended that that \nwould be the case.  The liability of the Individual Defendants in those circumstances is \nestablished because they have been guilty, in their capacity as members of the \nSupervisory Board, of a culpable failure to take steps to prevent the Misappropriation \neffected pursuant to each of the Relevant Drawdowns as and when they occurred (see \nthe conclusions as to Ukrainian law on this issue that I reached in paragraph 848 above).  \n1518.  I make these findings in relation to both of the Defendants, notwithstanding that it is \nclear that the dominant figure in controlling the Bank was Mr Kolomoisky.  I do not \naccept that Mr Bogolyubov had distanced himself from the affairs of the Bank to the \nextent that his counsel sought to portray, anyway at any stage prior to the end of what \nthe Bank called the active stage of the Misappropriation in September 2014, which is \nthe most relevant timescale for this purpose.  The Relevant Loans would not have be en \nmade without his approval and consent in his capacity as one of the two controlling \nshareholder s and chairman of the Supervisory Board.  The level of that influence and \ncontrol wa s such that h e was as much a participant in the making of the Relevant Loans \nand the authorising of the scheme under which the Relevant Drawdowns were made as \nwas Mr Kolomoisky.  Furthermore, he continued to participate in the events which \noccurred between then and nat ionalisation in a manner which made clear both that he, \nlike Mr Kolomoisky, knew all about and had approved the Misappropriation, and that \nhe needed to do what he could to assist in ensuring that the Bank could carry on in \nbusiness without making full disclosure (and rectifying the consequences) of its \nexposure to r el"}

I am therefore satisfied that, in causing, procuring and approving the Misappropriation , \ninvolving as it did the entry into of the Relevant Loans and the making of the Relevant \nDrawdowns, both of the Individual Defendants acted unlawfully.  The  Relevant Loans \nwere entered into and the Relevant Drawdowns were made without the formal approval \nof the Supervisory Board, in contravention of the Charter and the Bank’s credit \ncommittee regulations and on terms which could never have been validly authori sed \nbecause  they were so obviously contrary to the Bank’s best interests.  In all these \nrespects, this was unlawful conduct within the meaning of Article 1166.  It is clear to \nme that in causing the Bank to conclude and implement these arrangements with the \nBorrowers , the Individual Defendants failed not only to act in the interests of the Bank, \nbut also to “follow the requirements of the law, provisions of the charter and other \ndocuments of the company”, as required by Article 63.  \n1520.  Put another way, p rocuring the advances to be made to the Borrowers was an unlawful \nact by anyone such as the Individual Defendants who owed the fiduciary and other \nduties to the Bank I have described above.  The Borrowers were shell companies with \nno assets and no prospect  of repaying the money which had been transferred to them \npursuant to the Relevant Loan s and no proper security had been given.  The inference \nis overwhelming that the Individual Defendants knew that the scheme in which the \nBank was engag ed which led to the making of the Relevant Drawdowns would expose \nthe Bank to a very substantial risk that the loans would be irrecoverable, which in the \nevent occurred because of the Unreturned Prepayments (a point to which I shall return).  \nI also have n o doubt that, because t he Borrowers were all owned and controlled by the \nIndividual Defendants  through PBC , there is no conceivable basis on which the \nnominee directors and UBOs of the Borrowers would have caused the Borrowers to \nenter into the Relevant Lo an Agreements or make and receive the Relevant Drawdowns \nwithout the Individual Defendants ’ instructions to do so.  \n \nThe liability of the Individual Defendants under Article 1166: harm and causation  \n1521.  The way the Bank puts its case on harm is that it transferred money to the Borrowers \nunder sham loans drawdown pursuant to the Relevant Drawdowns in exchange for \nwhich it received (at most) a worthless covenant to repay from a Borrower which was \na shell co mpany being used as a vehicle for fraud.  I accept that this part of the Bank’s \nclaim has been established.  The harm it sustained was the amount drawn down which, \nbecause of the worthlessness of the Relevant Loan agreements (which were in any event \nshams)  and the absence of any proper security was for the full amounts of the Relevant \nDrawdowns.  How that was caused and how the court should assess full compensation \nfor the harm are two separate questions to be considered once the harm caused by the \nunlawful  act has been identified.  \n1522.  The total of the Relevant Drawdowns was US$2,335,943,519.

On the basis of the way \nthe Bank puts its case, this is the correct starting point for identifying the harm for which \nthe Bank is entitled to compensation from anyone who caused that harm by their \nunlawful acts.  However, using the payment references recorded in the Bank’s \ntransactional data to link the  relevant payments (which was the methodology adopted \nby the Bank’s forensic accounting expert), Relevant Drawdowns in the amount of \nUS$384,214,201 w ere then repaid by further Relevant Drawdowns.  The Bank says that \nthis shows a net total of Relevant Drawdowns not repaid by further Relevant \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n371 \n Drawdowns of US$1,951,729,318.  I agree that the c.$384 million figure must be \ndeducted to avoid double -counting.  This is close to the figure for Unreturned \nPrepayments of US$1,911,877,385, which itself is confirmed by the Kazantsev \nSpreadsheet and the Gu rieva Spreadsheet, the significance of which I have described \nearlier in this judgment and to which the Bank has limited its claim.   \n1523.  The Bank then submitted that the unlawful conduct of the Defendants caused it harm \nto which it is entitled to full compensation to the extent of at least US$1,911,877,385, \nbeing the amount of the Relevant Drawdowns to the extent that they were not \nthemselv es replaced by further Relevant Drawdowns.  Put another way, procuring the \nBank to make the Relevant Drawdowns caused the Bank harm, in the form of \ndeprivation of its money in exchange for no value.  The harm suffered at the moment \nof the Relevant Drawdown s was therefore caused by the Individual Defendants.  The \nconsequence is that the Individual Defendants then came under an obligation to provide \nfull compensation for the loss that is referable to the harm caused.  \n1524.  It was submitted that the burden then shifted to the Defendants to demonstrate that the \nBank had made genuine recoveries which further reduced its compensable loss.  The \nBank stressed in its closing submissions that this was the nature and extent of the ha rm \nfor which it claims to be compensated.  In particular, it does not allege that it suffered \nharm by being induced to enter into a series of bad or commercially impaired (but valid) \nloans which may have caused loss to the extent of their irrecoverability.   I accept that \nthe Bank’s analysis is supported by the evidence.   \n1525.  First of all,  I agree that the harm was caused by the unlawful conduct of the Individual \nDefendants.  The fact that other participants, such as members of the Management \nBoard who knew what was going on (e.g., Mr Novikov, Mr Dubilet and Ms Gurieva) \nmay also have committed unlawful acts does not break the chain of causation between \nthe Individual Defendants’ acts of procurement and the harm suffered by the Bank, nor \ndoes the fact that other unlawful acts, such as the approvals by the ECC, were \ncommitted betw een the time of the original approvals given by the Individual \nDefendants and the suffering of the harm on the making of the Relevant Drawdowns.  \n1526.  The reason for this is that I infer that the approvals and consents which must have been \ngiven by the Individual Defendants were continuing throughout the active period of the \nMisappropriation, and but for the instigation and sanction of the Individual Def endants, \nnone of the individual or corporate participants in the Misappropriation would have \nacted in the way they did.

Individuals such \nas Mr Novikov, Mr Dubilet and Ms Gurieva were subordinates of the Individual \nDefendants who were accustomed to comply and did comply with their instructions.  \nThe Relevant Entities were corporate vehicles controlled by the Individual Defendants \nthrough the medium of PBC and Primecap.  In my view, ther e is clearly a legally \nsignificant causal link between the harm and conduct by the Individual Defendants \nwhich created the conditions for harm and the actions which turned it into a reality.  \n1527.  I also consider that the evidence establishes sufficient unity of intent as to the \ninterrelated and cumulative unlawful conduct, committed by each of the Individual \nDefendants , which is sufficient for each of them to be jointly liable to compensate the \nBank for the  indivisible  harm in the form of the Relevant Drawdowns caused by that \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n372 \n conduct.  I have explained my fin dings in relation to Article 1190 and joint liability  in \nparagraphs  927ff above.  In my judgment, in this context, there i s no distinction between \nthe position of the Individual Defendants in relation to each of the Relevant \nDrawdowns , because they both owed the Bank the same duties and they both breached \nthose duties so as to engage the provisions of Article 1166 by permitting and procuring \nthe Relevant Drawdowns  to be made , which caused the harm in respect of which the \nBank now sues . I also think, that whatever may be the limitation of  the principle s to be \nderived from the Gaz Ukrainy  line of authorities, this is a case in which it is impossible \nto determine as between the Individual Defendants “ what action and to which extent ” \ncaused  the harm  in the form of the Relevant Drawdowns whether taken separately or \ntogether.  \n1528.  Even, having regard to the possibility that one of the Individual Defendants was more \ninvolved in the planning and implementation of the scheme than the other, it would \nhave been sufficient (as it was in Energobank  and Ukoopspilka ) if the unlawfulness was \nno more than a failure to intervene to stop the Misappropriation.  They both knew of \nthe essential elements and of the potential for the Bank to sustain loss.  Given the need \nfor their consent and approval for the scheme to procee d, Ukrainian law would tre at \nthem both as causally responsible for the harm in fact sustained  in the form of the \nRelevant Drawdowns .  In my judgment, the conduct of each of the Individual \nDefendants in connection with the operation of the loan recycling scheme, and the \nduties they breached as members of the Supervisory Board, were sufficiently inter -\nconnected and sufficiently directed at the same ultimate aim (viz. using a loan recycling \nscheme to extract money from the Bank), for the causal link between their conduct and \nthe harm sustained to have been established.  \n1529.  In their closing submissions, counsel for Mr Bogolyubov undertook the burden of \nexplaining why this analysis was wrong.  It was said to be a fatal flaw in the Bank’s \ncase that it cannot show that there was any Misappropriation or that it has suffered any \nloss because its contemporaneous records disclosed that there was never any intention \nfor the Relevant Drawdowns to leave the Bank and they did not do so.

All that \nhappened was that funds were circulated between the accounts of different notional \ncustomers .  The reality was that there was simply a series of internal credits and debits \nrecorded in the Bank’s ledgers and the vast majority of the obligations arising as a result \nof the Relevant Drawdowns were then discharged by the use of subsequent lending.  \n1530.  I should add that, i n reaching the conclusions I have on this part of the case, I have \nconsidered the way in which all of the Defendants sought to characterise the Bank's true \nharm as being limited to what were called Relevant  Drawdown Portions .  This was a \nconcept introduced into the pleadings as a result of evidence adduced from Mr \nDavidson , and was said by Mr Kolomoisky (an d on this point his case was adopted by \nthe other Defendants), to be correct because the Bank claims that only part of a Relevant \nDrawdown caused it loss and the balance is not the subject of the claim.  \n1531.  I do not think that this is the right way of looking at what occur red.  Quite apart from \nthe fact that it does not reflect the way in which the Bank has identified what it says is \nthe harm that it sustained as a result of the Defendants ’ unlawful conduct, it does not \ndraw the distinction between the harm which was suffered at the time each Relevant \nDrawdown was made and the full compensation to which it is entitled in the amount \nclaimed, all of which was said to have been caused by the Re levant Drawdowns, b ut \nbecause of the amount of US$384,214,201 which was repaid by further Relevant \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n373 \n Drawdowns, was not the same figure as the amount for which it accepts it is entitled as \nfull compensation for the harm it sustained.  \n1532.  Having established that the starting point for the harm it sustained was the full amount \nof the Relevant Drawdowns, I am satisfied that the Bank’s methodology, which was \nthen adopted in Mr Thompson’s evidence for the purposes of calculating and verifying \nthe figures was an appropriate transactionally -linked means of determin ing the full \ncompensation to which it was entitled.  It adopted an analysis of the links between the \nRelevant Drawdowns and the Unreturned Prepayments which was based on the Bank’s \ntrans actional data .  One of the several reasons why the Bank’s methodology was correct \nfor this purpose was that , recognising that the Bank sues in tort and does not seek a \nproprietary remedy for recover y of the amounts drawn down,  the methodology  \nrecognises and responds to the structure  of the recycling scheme  itself , at the heart of \nwhich was the Misappropriation  and in respect of which it sues .  It follows that , subject \nto any genuine repayments and the impact of the Limitation Defence, to which I will \nturn shortly, I am satisfied that the Individual Defendants are both liable to the Bank \nfor the full sum of US$1,911,877,385  claimed.  \n \nUnlawful conduct  of the Corporate Defendants : Article 1166  \n1533.

The RSAs were invalid \nsham contracts concluded to provide  ostensible justification for the transfer of the \nBank’s money  out of Ukraine. The true transactions they concealed were said to be void \nas contrary to public policy pursuant to Art icle 228(1) -(2), in that their aim was to \nfacilitate and conceal the misappropriation of  the Bank’s funds .  I think there is no doubt \nthat is the case.  The Bank also said that the Corporate Defendants further participated \nin other measures taken to disguise the Misappropriation, including  the prepar ation of \nbackdated LFSAs  and the creation of sham  documentation to substantiate the claims \nmade by Borrowers in the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings.  \n1534.  Because of the way in which the Corporate Defendants advanced their case on causation \nand harm, the precise nature of what is alleged against them is important.  The specific \nparticulars  of breach pleaded i n the B ank’s Particulars of Claim and Reply  included the \nfollowing allegations:  \ni) that, in order to enable themselves to receive the funds being misappropriated \nfrom the Bank, each of the Corporate Defendants created and/or executed at \nleast one RSA , the terms of which were commercially inexplicable a nd with \nwhich none of them had any intention o r prospect to comply;  \nii) that the Corporate Defendants  received the Unreturned Prepayments and \nthereafter failed either to deliver goods in accordance with the RSAs or to make \nrepayment to the Borrowers ; \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n374 \n iii) that the Corporate De fendants procured  sham correspondence and agreements \nbetween themselves and the Borrowers in relation to the 2014 Ukrainian \nProceedings ; and \niv) that the English Defendants each created and/or entered into the LFSAs i n order \nthat the Misappropriation could be hidden from the Bank’s auditors and/or the \nNBU . \n1535.  The particulars of breach also included a more general allegation that t he Corporate \nDefendants  assisted the Individual Defendants  in misappropriating $1,911,877,385 of \nthe Bank’s monies in the manner described in an earlier part of the pleading.   This \nallegation is very wide -ranging in its form , and the Bank made clear in its written \nopening that the conduct which gave rise to liability comprised the Corporate \nDefendants’  participation in the Misapp ropriation and the subsequent attemp t to \nconceal it as par ticularised in the Particulars of Claim .  This therefore included assisting \nin the Misappropriation by being part y to documentation such as the RSAs and the RSA \nPledges which were in fact shams.  \n1536.  In light of the conclusions I have reached on what occurred as part of the \nMisappropriation, and the fact that the Corporate Defendants were corporate vehicles \nowned and controlled by the Individual Defendants, I am satisfied that their knowledge \nis to be attributed to the Corporate Defendants , a state of awareness which exten ds to \nall of the essential elements of the loan recycling scheme and the Misappropriation.   It \nfollows that the Corporate Defendants knew that the monies they received by way of \nUnreturned Prepayments  were received for an unlawful purpose , the very nature of \nwhich had the effect of harming the Bank.  \n1537.

The Corporate Defendants relied on Mr Nahnybida’s  evidence that the actions of the \nCorporate Defendants, such as creating and executing documentation for transactions \nin order to  disguis e the Misappropriation  and allowing the use of the Corporate \nDefendants' bank accounts  did not  violate Article 3(1)(2) or Article 13 .  In my view this \nevidence does not sufficiently focus on the fact s that the se Articles are engaged when \nconduct is aimed at and facilitates the deprivation of the Bank’s property in a manner \nnot permitted by Ukrainian law and that there is no requirement for the Corporate \nDefendants to have taken funds directly from the Bank for the test to be satisfied.  \n1539.

It was said that, by facilitating  the onward transmission of the funds , \nthe Corporate Defendants assisted in misappropriat ing them from the Bank, and \nassisted in conceal ing the misappropriation , that being conduct sufficient to constitute \na breach of Art icle 3(1)(2).  \n1540.  I agree .  I accept that Ukrainian law has adopted a wide and flexible definition of  \n‘property’, and applied the protections afforded to property interests in obviously \npersonal (and not proprietary) claims.   The conduct of the Corporate Defendants  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n375 \n facilitated the onward transmission of the funds  misappropriated from the Bank, and \nassisted in the concealment of the Misappropriation .  In light of the conclusions I have \nreached on the meaning and scope of Article 3(1)(2)  (see paragraphs 893ff above) , I am \nsatisfied that the Corporate Defendants ’ conduct in participating in the \nMisappropriation and subsequent attempts to conceal it, is conduct w hich breaches the \nprohibition against depriv ing a person of their ownership of property, is contrary to  \nArticle 3(1)(2)  and is therefore unlawful for the purposes of Article 1166.  \n1541.  By way of p ostscript, I should mention that at one stage the Individual Defendants \nadvance d an argument that the claims in tort against them were precluded by what was \ncalled the rule against competition of claims.  This was not pursued in closing \nsubmissions and I need say no more about it . \n \nThe liability of the Corporate Defendants under Article 1166: harm and causation  \n1542.  The next question  for determination is whether the harm suffered by the Bank on the \nmaking of the Relevant Drawdowns  was caused  by any of the C orporate Defendants ’ \nunlawful act s.  This is a much more acute issue for the Bank’s claim against the \nCorporate Defendants than it is for the Bank’s claim against the Individual Defendants, \nbecause the nature of the unlawful conduct they committed and the role that they \nfulfilled in the Misappropriation and the loan recycling is very much more confined \nthan that of t he Individual Defendants . \n1543.

Ukrainian law does not provide \na freestanding cause of action akin to the tort of conspiracy under English law , they did \nnot owe fiduciary duties to the Bank and, s ave in the most general sense , their acts of \nparticipation were limited to the Relevant Drawdowns which relate to the Unreturned \nPrepayments which they themselves received .   \n1544.  The Corporate Defendants  submitted that the Bank cannot establish a sufficient causal \nlink between the unlawful act s alleged against them and the harm  it sustained .  This \nsubmission is based on the Bank's case that it susta ined harm  at the point of each \nRelevant Drawdown , when there was one of  270 separate fraudulent  misappropriations \nof the Bank’s money . The Corporate Defendants said that the timing and \ncontemporaneous documentary evidence clearly demonstrate d that the unlawful acts \npleaded against them by th e Bank played no role in causing the Relevant Drawdowns , \nbecause the y occurred after the Relevant Drawdown constituting the harm had been \nmade .  They also relied on the fact that the Bank’s own case is that the Corporate \nDefendants involvement was only in cover ing up the harm  and concealing the fraud . \n1545.  The Corporate Defendants describe d the Relevant Drawdowns and their RSAs as \nfalling into three categories , all of which are said to give rise to different categories of \ncausal connection.  In each case it is said that the Ukrainian law test for a causal link \nbetween any unlawful conduct by any of the Corporate Defendants and the harm \nsustained on the making of the Relevant Drawdown  is not satisfied.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n376 \n 1546.  The first category is t hose Relevant Drawdowns made  by a Relevant Borrower who had \nno RSA at all (“Non -RSA Connections”) .  They comprised  the four Relevant \nDrawdowns by Prominmet and the Cypriot Borrowers , in respect of which there was \nnever any RSA between that Relevant Borrower and any of the Corporate Defendants .  \nThe Corporate Defendants  point ed out that the Bank’s case is that the contemporaneous \ncommunications show that the Relevant Drawdowns of th e Cypriot Borrowers took \nplace before the agreements f or their Relevant Loans were put in place . \n1547.  The second category is t hose 245 Relevant Drawdowns , which were cycled at least \nonce via a different prepayment under a different supply agreement before the \nUnreturned Prepayment was made under the associated RSA (“Looped Connections”) .  \nThe Corporate De fendants were correct to submit that the evidence showed that th e \napproval and agreeing of each Relevant Loan under which each Relevant Drawdown \nwas obtained pre -dated the coming into existence of the associated RSAs .  This was \nsaid to mean that t he RSA s necessarily cannot have been used in the process of the \napproval and agree ment  of those loans.  It was said that, i nsofar as the approval and \nagree ment  of any of those Relevant Loans may have involved reliance by the Bank on \nthe existence of a supply agreement, it cannot have been the associated RSA , because \nthe Relevant Drawdowns were transferred onwards as part of the first loop under other \nsupply agreements.   It follows that t he RSAs referenced in the final loops of Looped \nConnections cannot have been a ca use of the Relevant Drawdowns.  \n1548.

The third category is those 21 Relevant Drawdowns , which were transferred directly as \nan Unreturned Prepayment under the associated RSA (“No -Loop Connections”).   It is \nsaid that, of those, 14 were drawn do wn under Relevant Loans which had been approved \nand agreed well before the drawdown and seven were drawn down contemporaneously \nwith the approval and agreeing of the Relevant Loans .  It was submitted that the \ndocumentary evidence shows that , even in those instances, the executed RSAs did not \nplay a role in  effecting those drawdowns.  \n1549.  Although the evidence demonstrates that , in all but a very few instances , the Relevant \nLoans were  agreed before the execution of the associated RSA, that is not the case with \nthe Relevant Drawdowns .  However, the Corporate Defendants pointed out that the \ndrawdown requests from Borrower to Bank for the seven No -Loop Connection \nRelevant RSAs entered into  contemporaneously with the approval and agreeing of the \nassociated Relevant Loans did not refer to the purpose of the drawdown nor that it \nwould be used to make (or ‘fund’) an Unreturned  Prepaym ent.  Counsel for the \nCorporate Defendants sought to illustr ate this point b y reference to the US$36.8 million \nRelevant Drawdown made by Uniks  on 31 July 2014 (I have already made brief \nreference to this in paragraph  325 above ), with an onward transfer to Teamtrend the \nfollowing day . \n1550.  I agree that the documentation show s that t he Corporate Defendants  did not prepare the \ndraft RSA , but only executed it  and only did so after the Relevant Drawdown was made.   \nThe only documentation requested by BOK , and actually provided by PBC in advance \nof the Relevant Drawdown , did not refer to the RSA or to Teamtrend , and th e Bank \napproved the Relevant Loan prior to any mention of Teamtrend or an  RSA , (although \nthat is only on the basis that the do cumentation must have been backdated ).  The \nCorporate Defendants also pointed out that the Bank relied on the same  evidence to \nsupport its submission that the  Relevant Loans are  shams.   Nonetheless in a case such \nas Uniks, it is my view that given the nature of what was going on, little can be drawn \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n377 \n from th e documentary record ; it is likely that those directly engaged in operating the \nscheme on behalf of the Bank, the Borrowers and the Corporate Defendants would have \nknow n of the link.  \n1551.  It was also said that the absen ce of any causal link could be seen from the evidence of \nwidespread backdating of the RSAs relied upon by the Bank.  If the documents did not \neven exist at the time of the Relevant Drawdowns , they could not have had  anything at \nall to do with the Borrowers obtaining those monies. Likewise , it was clear that the \nCorporate Defendants  did not actually create the RSA document ation , but only \nexecuted the drafts  presented to them by employees of BOK or PBC , while there was \nevidence that sometimes the provision of RSAs was overlooked altogether.   I am not \npersuaded that this last point is of any real significance . \n1552.  The Corporate Defendants also relied on the Bank’s reference  to the Borrowers having \npledged their rights to goods or repayment under RSAs to secure some of the Relevant \nLoans.

It \nfollowed, so the Corporate Defendants submitted , that a ny further use of the RSAs by \nthe Borrowers was not attributable to the Corporate Defendants .  Likewise it was said \nthat t he RSA Pledges  all post -dated the Relevant Drawdowns and so cannot have been \ncausative of the agreement of the Relevant Loans or the making of the Relevant \nDrawdowns. The Corporate Defendants  gave by way of example an RSA Pledge from \nInker iya to the Bank dated 28  August 2014  in respect of which both the Relevant \nDrawdown and the associated Unreturned Prepayment to Ukr transitservice were made \nsix weeks earlier on 14 July 2014.  \n1553.  I will come back to the timing point, but t he fact that the RSA Pledge s were contracts \nbetween the Bank and the Borrowers to which the Corporate Defendants  were not part y \ndoes not seem to me to take matters very much further .  Subject to identification of the \nappropriate Supplier, which is really the timing point, the structure of what was \nproposed was well know n. \n1554.  The Corporate Defendants said that it was also  relevant to causation as between any \nunlawful act committed by it and any harm sustained by the Bank that receipt of the \nUnreturned Prepayments  and their onward transfer and non -repayment under the \nrelevant RSA were not a cause of harm , because a ll of these events necessarily took \nplace after each of the Relevant Drawdowns  had been made , and therefore after the \nspecific harm  alleged by the Bank  had been suffered.   In 36 instances (totalling \nc.US$933m ), the Borrower which had transferr ed to the Corporate Defendants was also \nthe onward transferee receiving the funds back from the Corporate Defendants .  \nOtherwise, the onward transferees we re other non -Ukrainian companies involved in the \nscheme or were used to repay the loans of other Borrowers.  \n1555.  It was said that , because all onward transfers were to other accounts within the Bank, \nthe net financial position of the Bank was the same pre -receipt, upon receipt and post -\nonward transfer. It was said that t he position both before and after was that there was a \ncredit balance in the amount of the Unreturned Prepayment in an account of a customer \nof the Bank ( whether Borrower, Corporate Defendant or onward transferee).   The only \nchange was the identity of the customer but  that was said by the Corporate Def endants \nto be  functionally irrelevant as all are said by the Bank to be worthless companies  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n378 \n owned and controlled  by the Individual Defenda nts.  I do not think that this point goes \nanywhere  on this part of the cas e.  The question is whether ther e is a cau sal link between \nthe outflow on the making of the Relevant Drawdown and the Corporate Defendant’s \nconduct and what happened to the funds after they left the ir hands. If anything that goes \nto the compensation to be paid, not to the causal link between conduct and harm . \n1556.

It was \nsubmitted that , even if the purposes of the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings w ere to enable \nthe Borrowers to avoid incurring substantial penalties under currency control laws  and \nto furnish the Bank with evidence  capable of being supplied to the NBU  to explain wh y \nthe Relevant Loans had not been repaid  (which I agree that they were ), that is not a \ncause of the harm relied on by  the Bank , i.e., each of the Relevant Drawdowns .  In any \nevent, as the Corporate Defendants pointed out, it is not suggested that the judgments \nand awards were  ever provided to the NBU  or had any particular effect on any course \nof action that it took . \n1557.  As to the 78 LFSAs , 37 of which were executed by the English Defendants and 41 of \nwhich were executed by other Suppliers  (none were executed by the BVI Defendants) , \nthe Corporate Defendants pointed out that the Bank alleged that this purported security \nwas in reality created to disguise the Misappropriation to avoid detection by the NBU, \nwhich I am satisfied that it was.   They said that the  LFSAs executed by the English \nDefendants  either had no functional effect (if they were  no more than a paper exercise \nwith no substance, i.e., a sham)  or, if they did , cannot have caused the alleged harm . \n1558.  The reasons for this were that (a) they were agreements between the Bank and the \nBorrowers to which the Corporate Defendants were not party  and (b) they were all dated \nafter both the Relevant Drawdowns and the agreement of the Relevant Loans, and \ntherefore cannot have been used to obtain the Relevant Drawdowns , more especially if \nas the Bank alleged to be the case many were backdated  (the timing point again) .  \nFurthermore , Relevant Loans were only ever partially secured by  LFSA  Pledges  over \nRSAs from  the English Defendants , rather than other Suppliers , with the consequence \nthat the recipient of an Unreturned Prepayment and the party to the LFSA pledged to \nsecure the Relevant Loan used to obtain a Relevant Drawdown which ‘caused’ that \nUnreturned Prepayment, were often different.  \n1559.  The Corporate Defendants also submitted that the evidence in any event shows that the \ncover up was ineffective  and that n obody internal to the Bank , the new management or \nthe NBU w as fooled or deceived by any of these documents .  I agree that there are \ncertainly some  indications that this was the case , although my description earlier in this \njudgment of what occurred between the time  of the last of the Relevant Drawdowns and \nnationalisation, and the time that matters took to come to a head , illustrates why  it is \noversimplistic to conclude that the Corporate Defendants can have no liability for \nineffectual or redundant wrongdoing .  That can only be based on the likelihood that, \neven if the Bank had claimed on the basis of harm caused by the alleged cover -up, that \nclaim would have failed . \n1560.  Part of the Corporate Defendants’ answer to the claims against them was that the Bank \nwould have suffered loss in any event, because the harm was caused by the Borrowers \nwho drew down the funds which crystallised at the time of each Relevant Drawdown. \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n379 \n I do not accept that this of itself relieves the Corporate Defendants from liability.

Indeed it was a central \npart of the operation of the s cheme as devised.  If the Bank was caused harm by the \nCorporate Defendants it was actionable as much as the harm caused by the Individual \nDefendants because, without their participation (or that of somebody else fulfilling their \nrole) through the entry int o of the RSAs, those parts of the scheme which resulted in \nthe Unreturned Prepayments would not have been carried into effect.  Put another way, \nit is clear from the way in which the scheme operated that the entry into the RSAs by \nthe Corporate Defendants or some other Supplier was an inherent part of the same \nscheme in which the Relevant Drawdowns which gave rise to the harm sustained by the \nBank were made.  \n1561.  That this is capable of being sufficient appears from cases such as Gaz Ukrainy  and \nDTEK .  Thus i t is clear from the approach adopted in Energobank , Ukoopspilka  and \nGaz Ukrainy  that it is possible for a person acting unlawfully as part of a pre -planned \nscheme to still be causally responsible for the harm sustained by the Bank, even if the \nprimary act (in the case of the Corporate Defendants the entry into of the RSAs and the \nreceipt of the Unreturned Prepayment) occurred after the time of the harm (in the \npresent case the making of the Relevant Drawdowns).   There are two ways of looking \nat the reason for this as a matter of Ukrainian law.  The first is that they caused the harm \nbecause it would not have been sustained by the Bank if they had not pre -agreed to the \nRSAs, even if their participation in receiving  the Unreturned Prepayment occurred later.  \nThe second is that their participation was a simple case of assistance in a scheme, which \ntaken as a whole, involved them in committing the unlawful acts I have  already \ndescribed.  \n1562.  The possibility of the first of these two reason s is based on a proper understanding of \nGaz Ukrainy .  As Mr Marchukov pointed out , it may well have b een an important point \non the facts of that case that it had  been pre -agreed that the relevant  defendant should  \nreceive the monies.  It is the Corporate Defendants’ case that , in the vast majority of \nRelevant Drawdowns , they  were only selected to receive an Unreturned Prepayment on \nan ad hoc  basis well after the Relevant Loan had been agreed and  often months aft er \nthe Relevant Drawdown  itself had been made . \n1563.  In my view , the evidence demonstrates very clearly that the whole scheme was co -\nordinated by BOK, but it also shows that it was often not planned and pre -determined \nthat a particular Relevant Loan would be approved and agreed to facilitate a Relevant \nDrawdown for onward transfer to a pre -selected Supplier.   Indeed it was i ntrinsic to the \nongoing management of the loan recycling process that, at the time of approval and \nagreement of each Relevant Loan, it was not known whether any particular Supplier \nwould have any in volvement thereafter.   Indeed , as a matter of fact , in the case of \nLooped Transactions, the process of selecting one of the Corporate Defendants to \nreceive an Unreturned Prepayment often only occur red months after the Relevant \nDrawdown.  \n1564.  It seems to me that this is a critical factual question.  Subject to questions on the \napplication of Article 1190 , it is only in relation to Relevant Drawdowns where it is \npossible to identify that a Corporate Defendant would be a party to the RSA under \nwhich an Unreturned Prepayment was to be paid , that it is possible to say that they  \nmight have done anything which caused  the specific harm to the Bank that occurred on \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Priv"}

In my judgment,  whether “direct cause ”, \n“main reason ” or “objective consequence ” is the appropriate test, an ability to identify \nthe Corporate Defendant to receive the Unre turned Prepayme nt at the time of the \nRelevant  Drawdown  is required  to establish causation .  If that cannot be done,  there is \nan insufficient causal link to show that  any Corporate Defendant caused that element \nof the harm in respect of which the Bank sued .  In my view, m erely because a particular \nCorporate Defendant might have accepted Unreturned Prepayments on previous \noccasions , or might be chosen at some future date, does not suffice.   It seems to me that \neven though they might have been  controlled by the Individual Defendants, and  even \nthough , in the events that transpired , they became the recipients of the Unreturned \nPrepayment  in due course , they must be identifiable as participants at the time of the \nharm . \n1565.  There was limited evidence on this point  but, in assessing the appropriate inferences I \nhave in mind the fact that the scheme was operated as a single whole.   In that context, \nit seems to me that the task for the court is to work out whether any of the Corporate \nDefendants had been identified by the operators of the scheme , not at the time the \nRelevant Loan was agreed , but at the time the Relevant Drawdown was made.  Given \nthe centralise d manner in which th e scheme was operated, t he time that BOK \ndetermined  that the money was required to be drawn down is the critical point, not the \ntime that the original Relevant Loan was agreed.  \n1566.  Where that is the situation, it is right  to conclude that the harm sustained by the Bank \ncan properly be said to have been caused  by the chosen Corporate Defendant’s \nparticipation as the putative Supplier , even though not yet documented.  In my \njudgment, in  the absence of any clear evidence, i t will be appropriate to draw that \ninference where the applicable RSA dates from or about the Relevant Drawdown , but \nnot if it is more than one month  later.  Any suspicion that an RSA  may have been \nbackdated is to be left out of account for these purp oses.  The backdating is just as likely \nto reflect a contemporaneous recognition that it had always been intended that the \nRelevant Drawdown was (and should have been recorded as ) associated with the RSA, \nas it is to reflect the possibility that the applicable Supplier was only chosen some time \nafter the Relevant Drawdown had already been made.  \n1567.  The next  question  relates to the second way of looking at what happened in Gaz \nUkrain y.  This is  whether a simple case of assistance in a scheme, which taken as a \nwhole involved the  Corporate Defendants  in committing the unlawful acts I have \nalready described , establishes sufficient unity of intent for each of the Corporate \nDefendants to be jointly liable  pursuant to Article 1190 .  The liability would then be to \ncompensate the Bank for the harm caused by the making of the Relevant Drawdowns, \neven where the particular Corporate Defendant concerned had not been chosen at the \ntime, or did not itself receive the Unreturned Prepayment referable to the Relevant \nDrawdown.

This also raises the question of whether the harm alleged by the Bank is \nindivisible . \n1568.  I have identified the amounts of the Unreturned Prepayments attributable to each of the \nCorporate Defendants in paragraph 380 above.    The Bank submitted that the re is \nsufficient unity of intent , because the actions of each of the Corporate Defendants were \nall part of a single wider scheme committed for a common (fraudulent) purpose and \nunder common direction.  It is said that all of the Corporate Defendants played the same \nrole in respect of dif ferent Unreturned Prepayments, and for that reason the Bank \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n381 \n suffered “indivisible harm by interrelated, [cumulative/collective] actions or actions \nwith unity of intent”, as the experts put it.  \n1569.  The Corporate Defendants submitted that the Bank’s case fails to appreciate that Article \n1190 imposes liability for jointly caused harm, not for joint participation in some \nscheme , one aspect of which, effected by others, is what causes the harm .  Put another \nway, liability under Article 1190 depends upon the Corporate Defendants’ acts of \nhaving caused the effecting of the Relevant Drawdowns .  The mere fact that they may \nhave  had a  role in the 2014 transactions more broadly is not sufficient because, u nder \nboth Article 1166 and 1190, the focus must always be on the harm  said to have been \nsustained, i.e. the Relevant Drawdowns.   Put another way, the Corporate Defendants \nsubmitted that a ssisting, or being ready to assist, after the event does not render them \nliable.  This was consistent with the experts’ agreement that  there is no  cause of action \nakin to the tort of conspiracy under English law.  The conduct alleged against the \nCorporate Defendants  could have been excluded , and the Relevant Drawdowns would \nstill have occurred.  \n1570.  It was submitted on behalf of the Bank  that the evidence demonstrates that the \nCorporate Defendants were all under the common control of the Individual Defendants \nand were all participants in a wider scheme under common direction in relation to which \nthey all played a significant role.   I agree with that submission so far as it goes , but I \ndo not agree  that this gives the answer , because t he question is whether the Corporate \nDefendants have caused  harm which is indivisible (which the separate Relevant \nDraw downs are not) “ by interrelated, [cumulative / collective] actions or actions with \nunity of intent ”.  The most that can be said about such elements  of the harm as did not \nlead to a Corporate Defendant to  commit to accept an Unreturned Prepayment , is that \nit was potentially there in the background to act as a Supplier if chosen to do so .  As I \ndo not think that t he component elements of the harm in the form of the 270 separate \nRelevant Drawdowns are indivisible, I do not consider that the Bank has established \nsufficient unity of intent as to the interrelated and cumulative unlawful conduct to give \nrise to joint liability of all of the Corporate Defendants both as bet ween themselves and \nas between themselves and the Individual Defendants.  \n1571.

Their acts of participation in the Misappropriation \nare the same whether they were undertaken on their own behalf or pursuant to the \nEnglish Agency Agreements.   As Mr Hunter submitted in closing, they still participated \nin and aided and abetted the Misappropriation even if they did so as agents.  \n1573.  A point to which I will revert in the context of the claim in unjust enrichment is that I \nthink this argument is also without merit for a different reason.  As I have already \nexplained earlier in this judgment I am satisfied that the ED Principals were, li ke the \nCorporate Defendants, ultimately controlled by the Individual Defendants.  As such, \nthey were aware of the nature of the scheme and the Misappropriation.  The evidence \ntherefore points strongly to the likelihood that the English Agency Agreements we re \nmade between two groups of companies owned and controlled by the Individual \nDefendants and that they had no genuine purpose apart from adding to the concealment.  \nI find that this was indeed the case.  \n1574.  This finding is based on a whole series of circumstances apart from the conclusion I \nhave reached on their ultimate beneficial ownership.  They include the fact there was \nno legitimate commercial reason (and none has been proffered by the Corporate \nDefenda nts) as to why the ED Principals should need or wish to conduct a “worldwide \nexport and import trading business” as undisclosed principals (the phrase used in the \nEnglish Agency Agreements).  The  commission payable under them was tiny and they \nprovided tha t the agent (i.e., one of the English Defendants) “shall not, unless expressly \nauthorised by the Principal …, disclose to any third party that the Agent is acting as \nagent or nominee for the Principal”.  As the Bank submitted, this would have made any \nlegitimate business impossible, because any legitimate purchaser of ore, heavy \nmachinery or PET was bound to want to look behind a relationship with the English \nDefendants, given the facts that they had no financial standing, no offices, no website, \nno staff, and no experience in this industry.  \n157"}

They also include the interconnectivity between the purported beneficial ownership of \nthe English Defendants and the ED Principals which made little commercial sense.  I \nwas shown by way of example evidence that the purported UBO of Hangli was  said to \nbe Ms Trykulych , but Ms Trykulych is also the purported UBO of Teamtrend, for whom \nHangli is said to be the relevant ED Principal.  Ms Trykulych is an employee of PBC \nand is also said to be  one of the  UBO s of 13 Borrowers, four of which ( Ortika, Ribotto, \nIntorno and Empire  LLC (“Empire”)) had all entered into RSAs with Teamtrend.  The \nBank is entitled to characterise this as a farce in which Ms  Tryk ulych’s companies \n(Ortika, Ribotto, Intorno and Empire) enter ed into contracts with another of her \ncompanies, Teamtrend, purportedly acting as undisclosed agent for yet another one \n(Hangli).  \n1576.  The Bank’s case that the English Agency Agreements had no genuine purpose apart \nfrom adding to the concealment is further supported by the fact that there has been no \nexplanation as to why, when the ED Principals did not supply goods or return the \nUnreturn ed Prepayments under the RSAs, there was no attempt by the Corporate \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n383 \n Defendants to bring claims against them under the indemnities contained in the English \nAgency Agreements.  I accept the Bank’s submission that a genuine agent would have \nbeen bound to take those steps, either when sued by the Borrowers in the 2014 \nUkrainia n Proceedings or following the judgments and arbitration awards against them.  \n1577.  I also accept the Bank’s submission that it is striking that there is no evidence as to how \nthe Corporate Defendants thought that the ED Principals were going to pay for any of \nthe goods, which the Corporate Defendants (as their purported agents) had assum ed \nobligations to supply.  The artificial and essentially dishonest nature of what was going \non is illustrated by the fact that what  purported to be instructions given by the ED \nPrincipals to the Corporate Defendants for the purchase of goods under Supply \nAgreements were backdated on a number of occasions.  In 2015, the English \nDefendants’ new accountants, DJC, started to ask difficult questions relating to the \nrationale behind a number of aspects of the Corporate Defendants’ activities, such as \nwhy Collyer  and Teamtrend had chosen to use a UK company to act as undisclosed \nagent for the purchase and sale of minerals where neither the produc er, the supplier, nor \ncustomer had any connection with the UK.  This request was made of Sofocleous and , \nin response, Pr imecap prepared a raft of backdated instructions from the ED Principals \nwhich I infer was done in an attempt to provide appropriate audit evidence.  This was \nplainly a dishonest attempt to pull the wool over the auditors’ eyes.  \n1578.  Finally, but tellingly, there is no evidence from either the Corporate Defendants or the \nED Principals themselves substantiating their case that the Corporate Defendants were \nbona fide agents and that the ED Principals were bona fide  principals.  One of the \nreasons for this was that all of the English Defendants ’ directors resigned immediately \nafter the Court of Appeal’s jurisdiction judgment, but there is no reason to think that \ntheir position could not have been verified on oath had they chosen to do so.  \n1579.

I am \nsatisfied that this was done for the purposes of the loan recycling scheme , but I am also \nsatisfied that the evidence supports a conclusion that it is  not just a question of whether \nthe English Agency Agreements were being used as part of a fraud .  This is a case in \nwhich,  despite the ir appearance, t here was no true agency relationship at all.  As such \nthey, and the agency relationship which they appeared to evidence or create, satisfied \nthe conventional test for being a sham, whether:  \ni) as a matter of English law , being the law said to govern  the contract , they were  \n“intended to give to third parties or the court the appearance of creating legal \nrights and obligations different from the actual rights and obligations if any \nwhich the parties intend to create ” (Snook v . London and West Riding Investment \nLtd [1967] 2 QB 786, 802); or  \nii) as a matter of Ukrainian law being  a transaction concluded by the parties for the \npurposes of concealing another transaction.  \n \nClaims in Restitution  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n384 \n 1580.  The Bank contends that its claims against the Corporate Defendants in unjust \nenrichment are governed by Ukrainian law.  It relies on Articles 10(1) and 10(4) of \nRegulation (EC) No 864/2007 on the law applicable to non -contractual obligations \n(Rome II), as retained by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and amended by \nSI 2019/834 (“Rome II”).  The Corporate Defendants contend that any claims against \nthem in unjust enrichment are governed by Cypriot law and they rely on Article 10(2) \nof Rome II:  \n“1.  If a non -contractual obligation arising out of unjust enrichment, including \npayment of amounts wrongly received, concerns a relationship existing between \nthe parties, such as one arising out of a contract or a tort/delict, that is closely \nconnected wi th that unjust enrichment, it shall be governed by the law that governs \nthat relationship.  \n… \n“3.  Where the law applicable cannot be determined on the basis of paragraphs 1 or \n2, it shall be the law of the country in which the unjust enrichment took place.  \n“4.   Where it is clear from all the circumstances of the case that the non - contractual \nobligation arising out of unjust enrichment is manifestly more closely connected \nwith a country other than that indicated in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, the law of that \nother country shall apply.”  \n1581.  The language of Article 10 therefore requires the court first to consider whether the \nnon-contractual obligation concerns a relationship existing between the Bank and the \nCorporate Defendants, which is closely connected with the unjust  enrichment.  If it \ndoes, the law that governs that relationship must be applied unless Article 10(4) is \nengaged.  In opening its case, the Bank submitted that its restitutionary claim against \nthe Corporate Defendants engaged Article 10(1) because it concerned the relationshi p \narising out of its tortious claim under Article 1166 against the Corporate Defendants.  \nIt still relied on the argument in its closing submissions, but without any further \ndevelopment.  \n1582.

Mr Plewman pointed out that this was an argument which had been disavowed by the \nBank on its application for a WFO at the outset of these proceedings, when it had \naccepted (without qualification) that “Article 10(1) does not apply because there is no \nexist ing relationship between the Bank and the Defendant Suppliers”.  He submitted \nthat the Bank was in any event correct to take the position which it then did, both \nbecause the claim in tort is not one based on the kind of duty which might establish a \nrelatio nship with the Bank, and because any such duty would not have been “existing” \nprior to the events giving rise to the claim.  \n1583.  In Banque Cantonale de Geneve  v. Polevent Ltd  [2016] QB 394 at [16] , Teare J was \nconcerned with a claim in deceit in which there was no relationship between the \nclaimant and the tortfeasor before the tort was committed.  He rejected an argument \nthat, because it could be said that, after the tort had been committed, there was a \nrelationship between victim and tortfeasor “with legal consequences”, that was \nsufficient to engage Article 10(1):  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n385 \n “16. … However, if that “relationship” were enough then Article 10(1) would add \nnothing to Article 4(1) in the context of the tort of deceit. Article 4(1) already \nprovides that where the obligation to provide restitution arises out of the tort, the \nlaw of the tort will govern that obligation. I therefore consider that Article 10(1) is \nnot intended to refer to  the mere “relationship” of wrongdoer and victim created by \nthe commission of the tort.  \n“17. Article 10(1) refers to a relationship “existing between the parties”. The \nnatural meaning of such a relationship in the context of article 10(1) is, it seems to \nme, one that is in existence before the facts which give rise to the “claim have \noccurred ;” \n1584.  I agree with the approach adopted by Teare J .  It follows that the Corporate Defendants \nare correct on this issue.  Article 10(1) of Rome II does not apply the law of Ukraine to \nthe claim against the Corporate Defendants.  \n1585.  Nobody argues that Article 10(2) applies, nor for that matter was there any mention of \nArticle 4(1) in the parties’ submissions.  So the next question is to identify the country \nin which the unjust enrichment took place for the purpose of determining the e ffect of \nArticle 10(3).  There is no real dispute about this.  The relevant country is Cyprus, \nbecause the Bank’s allegation is that the Corporate Defendants were enriched by \nacquiring property in the form of prepayments under the RSAs in circumstances in \nwhich they have never complied with their purported obligations under the RSAs or \nreturned the Unreturned Prepayments.  It is therefore the Bank’s case that the \nenrichment comes from the acquisition of property in the form of money which \noccurred with the crediting of the Corporate Defendants’ accounts at the Cyprus branch \nof the Bank.  \n1586.  The remaining argument is whether the prima facie  application of Article 10(3) is \ndisplaced by the “manifestly more closely connected” test contained in Article 10(4).  \nThe Bank submitted that it is, because the only relevant factor which connects the claim \nin unjust enrichment to Cyprus is the location of the Corporate Defendants’ bank \naccounts, which adds nothing because that is no more than the justification for applying \nArticle 10(3) in the first place.

The Bank also submitted that Cyprus as a location  was \nof no particular significance, because the Corporate Defendants could equally have had \ntheir accounts with another non -Ukrainian subsidiary of the Bank (e.g., in Latvia).  The \nonly point which mattered was that the destination of the funds should be o utside \nUkraine.  \n1587.  More positively, Ukraine was said to be manifestly more closely connected to the \nrestitutionary obligation than Cyprus, because the Corporate Defendants received the \nUnreturned Prepayments as part of a fraudulent scheme controlled by two Ukrainian \noligarch s with the purpose and effect of misappropriating funds from a Ukrainian Bank.  \nThe Bank also relied on the fact that the scheme was actually implemented by and with \nthe involvement of a number of individuals, including people said to be the UBOs of \nthe Co rporate Defendants, who were based in Ukraine (Mr Melnyk, Mr I Pugach, Ms \nYesipova, Ms Trkulych and Mr Ivlev).  It also relied on the fact that the Corporate \nDefendants knew that the Unreturned Prepayments were funded by fraudulent loans \nfrom the Bank in U kraine and the whole structure was designed to conceal breaches of \nUkrainian currency control regulations.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n386 \n 1588.  Mr Plewman submitted that, whatever the connections to Ukraine, it could not possibly \nbe said that the connections to Cyprus were not real and substantial.  The Corporate \nDefendants were not themselves Ukrainian (they were incorporated in England and the \nBVI) and they were managed by Cypriot professional directors; indeed it was the \nBank’s own case that the Individual Defendants’ control of and influence over the \nCorporate Defendants was through Primecap, a Cypriot corporate services provider \nestablished by  Cypriot lawyers.  He also said that Cyprus was the country in which the \nmoney which was the subject of the Bank’s claim continued to be located when it was \ntransferred on by the Corporate Defendants.  Another factor which counted against a \nmanifestly clos er connection to Ukraine  was that the prepayments were received by the \nCorporate Defendants in US$ rather than UAH.  \n1589.  An important starting point, as explained by the editors of Dicey (at para 36 -043), is \nthat the exception in Article 10(4) is only to be applied where there is a compelling \nreason for displacing the relevant general rule (in this case Article 10(3)).  This  is clear \nfrom the use of the word “manifestly” in the language of the Article.  I also agree that \nthe court’s task is to ascertain whether there is a country, which has a manifestly closer \nconnection to the restitutionary obligation – i.e., the focus is o n the country not the law.  \nIn the present case, the exercise required by Article 10(4) is a comparison of the \nconnection between the restitutionary obligation and Cyprus on the one hand and \nbetween the restitutionary obligation and Ukraine on the other.  \n1590.  One conclusion which flows from these principles is that the fact that the Corporate \nDefendants are English and BVI companies is not of much assistance in determining \nthe right answer, nor is the fact that the transfer was in US$ rather than UAH.  The \ncomp arison is between connections to Cyprus and connections to Ukraine.  \nConnections to third countries may go to show that not every factor apart from the place \nof receipt points inexorably to Ukraine, but if they do not point to Cyprus, their \nusefulness is l imited.  \n15"}

As to Primecap, although it is a corporate services provider established in Cyprus, my \nfindings as to the control over its activities exercised by individuals in Ukraine, both in \nrelation to the transactions with which these proceedings are concerned and m ore \ngenerally, mean that the connection to Cyprus is in fact and substance more limited than \nthe place of its establishment and operations might otherwise indicate.  The enrichment \noccurred in Cyprus (a factor which will always of course be present where i t said that \nArticle 10(4) should displace the prima facie  rule in Article 10(3)), but the expense was \nsustained by the Bank in the Ukraine.  I also think that, because steps which gave rise \nto an unjust enrichment were component parts of a fraud practised on a Ukrainian bank, \nstructured in the way that it was to  avoid Ukrainian currency control obligations, and \nclosely interrelated to torts governed by Ukrainian law in which the loss was sustained \nin Ukraine, points to a very close connection to Ukraine.  \n1592.  These are all powerful reasons for concluding that Article 10(4) is engaged.  There is, \nhowever, real substance in Mr Plewman’s point that a transfer out of Ukraine, and (more \nimportantly for the claim in unjust enrichment) a receipt by a recipient outside  Ukraine, \nwas an essential element of what all parties accept (for different reasons) was a loan \nrecycling scheme intended to avoid Ukraine’s currency control regulations.  I agree that \nthe fact that it was necessary for any enrichment to occur outside Ukr aine, detracts from \nany connection between the restitutionary obligation and Ukraine, and makes it more \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n387 \n difficult for the Bank to say that the connection to Ukraine is manifestly closer than \nCyprus.  \n1593.  Although I have not found the point an easy one, I have reached the conclusion that the \nBank is correct on this issue.  Notwithstanding the high bar which it has to overcome, \nI have concluded that it is clear from all the circumstances of the case, includi ng in \nparticular those to which I have specifically referred, that the restitutionary obligations \narising out of the Bank’s claims in unjust enrichment are manifestly more closely \nconnected with Ukraine than they are with Cyprus.  It follows that the law o f Ukraine \nshall apply.  \n \nUnjust Enrichment: Ukrainian law : Introduction  \n1594.  It was common ground between the experts that claims in unjust enrichment under \nUkrainian law are governed by the principles set out in Chapter 83 of the Civil Code, \nof which Article 1212 is the core provision.   Article 1212 is entitled “ General provisions \non obligations in connection with the acquisition or preservation of property without \nsufficient legal grounds ” and provides as follows:  \n“1.  A person who has acquired or preserved property at the expense of another \nperson (the injured party) without sufficient legal grounds (acquisition of property \nwithout grounds) shall be  obligated to return that property to the injured party. The \nperson is also obligated to return the property in the event that the ground upon \nwhich it was acquired later fell away.  \n2.  The provisions in this Chapter shall apply irrespective of whether the acquisition \nor reservation of property without grounds resulted from the conduct of the acquirer \nof the property, the injured party or other parties, o"}
{"start": 1463000, "text": " without sufficient legal grounds (acquisition of property \nwithout grounds) shall be  obligated to return that property to the injured party. The \nperson is also obligated to return the property in the event that the ground upon \nwhich it was acquired later fell away.  \n2.  The provisions in this Chapter shall apply irrespective of whether the acquisition \nor reservation of property without grounds resulted from the conduct of the acquirer \nof the property, the injured party or other parties, or as the result of an event .” \n1595.  Article 1213  is also relevant.  It is entitled  “In-kind return of unjustly acquired property ” \nand provides as follows:  \n“1.  An acquirer must return unjustly acquired property to an injured party in kind.  \n2.  If it is impossible to return unjustly acquired property to an injured party in kind, \nits value  (as determined at the time when the restitution case is heard) shall be \ncompensated. ” \n1596.  The experts described the elements of a claim under Article 1212 as follows:  \n“(i) the acquisition (or preservation) of property; (ii) such acquisition is at the \nexpense of the claimant; and (iii) the absence of legal grounds for the acquisition \n(or if there were such grounds, they have fallen away and ceased to exist).”  \n1597.  The experts also agreed in their joint statement that there is no need for a claimant to \nshow that the acquirer of property is at fault for a claim in unjust enrichment to succeed, \nthat for the purposes of Article 1212 property includes money (whether in t he form of \ncash or in a bank account) and that the length of time for which an acquirer holds the \nunjustly acquired property is irrelevant.   There was also no dispute between the experts \nthat the Civil Code makes no provision for a defence of change of pos ition.  It follows \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n388 \n that I accept Mr Beketov’s evidence that once a person has been enriched within the \nmeaning of Article 1212,  it is no defence that the enrichment has been dissipated, \nalthough dissipation may be relevant to the issue of remedy.  \n1598.  An introductory  argument advanced by the Corporate Defendants, although limited in \nits impact to the English Defendants , was that any Unreturned Prepayments they may \nhave received were received for the ED Principals under the English Agency \nAgreements with the consequence that they themselves did not acquire property for the \npurposes of Article 1212.  \n1599.  The Bank had two answers to this contention. The first was that the English Agency \nAgreements were shams and accordingly of no effect.  I have already explained my \nfindings to that effect in paragraphs 1572 ff above.  On that basis , it is self -evident that \nthe English Agency Agreements do not evidence a genuine relationship of agent and \nprincipal and they cannot operate to affect the fact that the recipients of the property \nwere the Corporate English Defendants not the ED Principals . \n1600.  The second argument is that even if the English Defendants  held the  Unreturned \nPrepayments on trust for the ED Principals, they still acquired  property for the purposes \nof a Ukrainian law claim in unjust enrichment , because legal title to the Unreturned \nPrepayments remained with them , Ukrainian law not recognis ing the notion of a \ndivision between legal and equitable title.  \n1601.  In light of my finding that the Agency Agreements were shams, the second point does \nnot arise.  However, I think it is another answer to  the English Defendants in any event.  \nI accept Mr Anderson’s submission that Ukrainian law would recognise that the English \nDefendants have been enriched by receipt of the monies for the purposes of a Ukrainian \nlaw claim in unjust enrichment because they received legal title to the Unreturned \nPrepayments regardless of where, as a matter of English law, the beneficial interest lies.  \n1602.  In reaching that conclusi"}

In reaching that conclusion, I have considered  Mr Nahnybida ’s evidence that, although \nthe English Agency Agreements were governed by English law, Article 1018 of the \nCivil Code applied, because the property was acquired by the English Defendants, \nacting as commission agents for the ED Principals.  He said that this meant that the \nacquirers of the funds paid to the English Defendants were the ED Princip als and not \nthe English Defendants themselves. It therefore followed that they would be the \nappropriate def endants to any claim under  Article 1212 : \n\"The property acquired by the commission agent at the expense of the principal is \nthe property of the principal.\"  \n1603.  I do not accept that this is the correct analysis.  Mr Beketov’s answer to this evidence \nwas contained in one of his reports and I agree with it.  He said the following in relation \nto Article 1018:  \n“I agree that under this provision where a commission agent receives funds \npursuant to his agency agreement, the effect of that provision is that those funds \nare treated under Ukrainian law as being owned by the commission agent’s \nprincipal, and the commiss ion agent has no rights of  ownership to the funds. I do \nnot, however, see how this rule of Ukrainian law can have any application in the \npresent case, where the Agency Agreements in question between the [English \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n389 \n Defendants]  and [the ED Principals]  are alleged by the Bank to be void, which if \ncorrect would in my view eliminate any basis for saying that the English \nDefendants]  held the funds they received to the account of [the ED Principals] , or \nthat the [ED Principals ] held the beneficial interest in those funds. ” \n \nUnjust Enrichment: Ukrainian law : causation and indirect enrichment  \n1604.  The next disputed issue is whether the Unreturned Prepayments amounted to an \nenrichment of the Corporate Defendants at the expense of the claimant .  The Bank  \nsubmitted  that they were because the Unreturned Prepayments were caused by the \nRelevant Drawdowns, such that the enrichment was at the expense of the Bank for the \npurposes of Art icle 1212 .  The Bank said that the straightforward analysis was that, but \nfor the Relevant Drawdowns, the Unreturned Prepayments would not have been made.   \nThis was sufficient because, a s Mr Beketov explained when expressing his view in the \njoint statement:  \n“where A has unjustly acquired property at the expense of B and A has \nsubsequently dissipated its enrichment to C, B may pursue a cause of action under \nArticle 1212 against A or C, although B would not be permitted to double recover \n… C hains of transfers that are causally linked together are  relevant to consider for \npurposes of determining liability under Article 1212”.  \n1605.  He expanded on this analysis of the effect of chains of transfers and causal links in one \nof his several reports by explaining that in his view, a causative element to a claim in \nunjust enrichment is inherent to the requirement of Article 1212 that the def endant’s \nenrichment be ‘at the claimant’s expense’.  He said the following:  \n“… the proper defendant(s) to an unjust enrichment claim are those who acquired \nproperty without sufficient legal grounds and at the Bank’s expense. Consistent \nwith this, at Beketov 8/248, 250, I explained that, in my view, where person A has \nacquired prop erty without sufficient legal grounds at the expense of "}

Consistent \nwith this, at Beketov 8/248, 250, I explained that, in my view, where person A has \nacquired prop erty without sufficient legal grounds at the expense of person B, and \nA has subsequently dissipated its unjust enrichment to person C, B may pursue an \nunjust enrichment claim against A or C, or indeed could pursue separate unjust \nenrichment claims against each of them (although B would not be permitted to \ndouble recover). This assumes that the elements of Article 1212 are satisfied in \nrespect of C’s acquisition, and in my view this should be the case where there is a \ncausative link between the first and sec ond transfers, because in that case C’s \nenrichment can be said to have been at B’s expense.  \n1606.  The Corporate Defendants challenge d that analysis on two levels.   The first gave rise \nto a question of law; t hey submitted  that, as a matter of Ukrainian law , indirect  \nenrichment is impermissible . The second was a c hallenge to the factual basis for saying  \nthat there  is a causal connection  between the Relevant Drawdowns and the Unreturned  \nPrepayments.   This is very similar to the question I have already addressed in relation \nto the claim under Article 1166.  \n1607.  As to the first point, the Corporate Defendants’ position was summarised by Mr \nNahnybida who said that it was his view that, in the example given by Mr Beketov, “B \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n390 \n only has a cause of action under Article 1212 against A”. He expressed his position \nwith some certainty on the causal link analysis as follows:  \n\"Chains of events causally linked together have no role to play in the Article 1212 \nanalysis. Rather the reduction (or non -increase) of property on the side of the victim \nand the increase (or preservation) of the same property on the side of the acquirer \nmust be interdependent counterparts, like ‘ two sides of the same coin ’.\" \n1608.  Originally the Bank was able to point to a number of cases in which the Supreme Court \nhad used the language of a causal relationship when describing the increase in the \nproperty of one person and a corresponding loss of property by another: see e.g. case \nNo. 910/59/22, Bionics Lab  at [86] and case No. 903/359/21, Brandbord LLC v . \nCommunal Enterprise \"Lutskreklama\" at [34]).  But, by the commencement of the trial, \nthe case on which it placed most reliance was the decision of the Supreme Court in case \nNo. 901 /17361/21, Peasant Fa rm Ukraine v . State Treasury Service of Ukraine  \n(“Peasant Farm ”). \n1609.  In Peasant Farm  the claimant contended that fraudsters, masquerading as legitimate \nagricultural companies with whom it would normally transact, had set up bank accounts \nin the name of those legitimate companies, procured the Peasant Farm to make \npayments into those accou nts and then a day or so later, withdrawn funds from those \naccounts, using forged cheques, as purported wages for employees.  In order to enable \nthe withdrawals under this pretext, tax and other levies on these purported ‘wages’ had \nbeen ded ucted at source and paid over to the State Treasury Service (“STS”), which \nreceived a total of UAH 5,273,500 in payments that were not in reality due, because the \nfunds withdrawn had not in fact been used to pay wages.  \n1610.  Peasant F arm claimed for the return of the UAH 5,273,500.  It succeeded in the \nCommercial Court, the decision of which was overturned in the Court of Appeal but \nwas then restored in the Supreme Court.

It succeeded in the \nCommercial Court, the decision of which was overturned in the Court of Appeal but \nwas then restored in the Supreme Court.  The Bank submitted (and I agree) that this \ndecision is a clear ex ample of indirect enrichment.  The STS did not receive funds \ndirectly from the Peasant Farm, but rather from accounts (operated by fraudsters) in the \nname of third -party companies.  Furthermore, the STS’s enrichment and the Peasant \nFarm’s loss w ere not simultaneous, but were separated in time by at least a day.  In \ncross -examination, Mr Nahnybida accepted:  \n“there were several transfers of the Farm Enterprise’s Funds to a number of \nrecipients, including the State Entity and the enrichment of the State Entity did not \ninvolve a simultaneous reduction of the property on the side of the Farm Enterprise \n… the loss  and the enrichment were not independent counterparts arising from the \nsame event. They were not two sides of the same coin”.  \n1611.  This therefore undermined Mr Nahnybida’s original explanation of the principle that a \nclaim for indirect enrichment is impermissible under Article 1212.  It was also wrong \nto suggest, as was put to Mr Beketov in cross -examination , that Peasant Farm  was not \na case of indirect enrichment at all because “the money was in fact never received by \nthe third parties at all; it was paid into some fraudulently created bank accounts opened \nby the fraudsters which just happened to use the third parties' name”.  To the extent that \nhe did so, Mr Beketov was wrong to accept this suggestion, because the money went \nfrom Peasant Farm into accounts in the names of third parties, stayed there for one or \ntwo days and then went from those accounts in part to the STS and in part t o the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n391 \n fraudsters as fake wages.  In the event the point did not seem to be pursued in closing \nsubmission by the Corporate Defendants in that form, although Mr Plewman did \nsuggest that the “indirectness” of the receipt of monies by STS was in substance \nephemeral because the intervening bank account through which the money passed was \nan account in the name of an entity which did not authorise its opening to begin with , \nso that it can never itself have acquired the funds . \n1612.  In cross -examination, Mr Nahnybida  also suggest ed that Peasant Farm  was different \nfrom this case, because it concerned “an indirect preservation but not an acquisition ” of \nmoney .  The Bank submitted that this was a novel distinction belatedly concocted by \nhim in an effort to evade the clear findings made in that Peasant Farm  that indirect \nenrichment was permissible.   Mr Anderson submitted that this is not a distinction drawn \nin Article 1212 itself or in any of the authorities.  I agree that both acquisition and \npreservation are referred to in Articles 1212(1) and 1212(2) collectively and without \ndistinction.  The words are also used without distinction in the language of the ruling \nin Peasant Farm  itself and Mr Nahnybida did not identify any case in which such a \ndistinction had been drawn.   However, I think that the distinction i s clear in concept \nbecause, as Mr Beketov explained in his report, a  person may become enriched by  (a) \nthe actual acquisition of another’s property or property rights; or (b) preserving or \nsaving his own property at the expense or detriment of another.  \n1613.  But critically on this point, it is clear from the Resolution recording the actual decision \nin Peasant Farm  that the Supreme Court had in any event analysed the case as one \nabout acquisition not preservation.

But critically on this point, it is clear from the Resolution recording the actual decision \nin Peasant Farm  that the Supreme Court had in any event analysed the case as one \nabout acquisition not preservation.  In my view the distinction suggested by Mr \nNahnybida and its impact on the arguments in this case do not reflect the law of \nUkraine.  \n1614.  Mr Nahnybida  also suggested that the decision in Peasant Farm  was inconsistent with \nthe earlier decision of the Grand C hamber in case  No. 910/3009 /18, All Ukrainian Joint \nStock Bank v . NBU in the liquidation of VAB Bank PJSC  (“VAB Bank ”).  He had relied \non this case in an earlier report in support of the following propositions:  \n“… that the consequence of further alienation of groundlessly acquired property is \nto transform the object of the unjust enrichment obligation: instead of returning the \nproperty in kind, compensation for this property must be paid to the victim. That \nwas t he only alternative envisaged. The Supreme Court did not suggest that relief \nunder Articles 1212 -1214 of the Civil Code would be available against the other \nperson to whom the securities had been alienated. The obliged person under Article \n1212 of the Civi l Code always remains the one who was enriched due to the initial \ndirect groundless acquisition of property, directly connected to the loss of that \nproperty by the victim, irrespective of whoever subsequently acquired the \nproperty.”  \n1615.  I do not agree with Mr Nahnybida’s evidence on this point, and I think that Mr \nBeketov’s conclusion that, on a proper analysis, VAB Bank  is not relevant to the issue \nin hand reflects Ukrainian law. As Mr Anderson explored in his cross -examination of \nMr Nahnybida, VAB Bank was a two -party case involving a direct transfer between the \nclaimant, VAB Bank  (claiming through the DGF), and the defendant, NBU.  The Grand \nChamber was primarily concerned with interpreting two other statutory provisions and \nits consideration of Article 1212 was expressly obiter.  It did not purport to consider the \npossibility of a  claim against an indirect recipient be cause that was an issue which \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n392 \n simply did not arise.  All that it said in relation to Article 1212 was that, if the direct \nrecipient of specific property no longer retained the property it received from the \nclaimant, the claimant should bring its claim against the direct recipient under Article \n1213 for compensation for the value of the property rather than the return of the \nproperty in kind, which is something that the claimant did not do in that case.  The \nreason the claim actually failed was that the relief actually sought was in appro priate.  \n1616.  I should record that a t the end of Mr Nahnybida’s  evidence on this point, Mr Anderson \nput it to  him that  the Grand Chamber does not say in VAB Bank  that no claim can be \nbrought under Article 1212 against an onward recipient of the securities : “It just does \nnot say that because it wasn't asked to consider the point. Do you agree? ”.  Mr \nNahnybida did not agree with that suggestion, but I think he was wrong not to do so.  I \nam satisfied that there is nothing in VAB Bank  that is inconsistent with the later deci sion \nof the Supreme Court in Peasant Farm , and that the result in Peasant Farm  reflects a \nproper application of the law of Ukraine on this point.  \n1617.  However one aspect of the test , which is also  mandatory , is the requirement spelt out in \ntwo resolutions  of the Supreme Court in c ase No. 910/9345/17  and cas e No. \n916/2478/20  (only partial translations were in the papers) , both of which were referred \nto by Mr Beketo v and pick"}

The way that the \npoint was put by the Supreme Court in case No. 916/2478/20  was that : \n“the mandatory condition is the coincidence in time of the increase in property of \none party (the acquirer) and reduction of property of another party (the injured \nparty), as well as the lack of sufficient legal ground (a legal fact) for enrichment.”  \n1618.  The mandatory  close ness of the connection was  also articulated in  another resolution \nof the Supreme Court dated 6 February 2020 in case No. 910/13271/18  (only a partial \ntranslation was in the papers) , albeit no t with quite such an emphasis on the issue of \ncoincidence .  Mr Beketov had originally included a translation which s uggest ed that the \nthird element for an unjust enrichment claim was “a causal link between the increase or \npreservation of property by the acquirer and the reduction or absence of increas e on the \npart of the victim”.   This was subsequently accepted by Beketov as incorrect and he \nagreed  that the correct translation of the Supreme Court’s third requirement for unjust \nenrichment was “(3) conditionality of increase or retention of property on the part of \nthe acquirer by a decrease or absence of increase on the part of the victim”  \n1619.  I can see that  there may be  good policy reasons for preferring Mr Beketov’s evidence.  \nAs he pointed out, if Mr Nahnybida were correct, it would mean that a person setting \nout to unjustly enrich himself at another’s expense could avoid liability under Article \n1212  by imposing a straw man in a chain of transactions between himself and the \nvictim.  He considered that, for reasons of policy, the Ukrainian courts would reject \nsuch an outcome  and t he Bank submitted that this is not a conclusion that a sensible \nlegal system should countenance.  \n1620.  However, it is very difficult for an English court to satisfy itself that Ukrainian law will \nmove further in that direction  and I  think it is unhelpful, and potentially misleading , to \nuse the language of causation without appropriate qualification as the princip al basis  \nfor identifying the enrichment element of a claim under Ukrainian law.   While it is \ncertainly the case that a causal connection is required , I prefer Mr Nahnybida’s  view \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n393 \n that this is only part of the test and that there is also a requirement for conditionality or \ncorrespondence of enrichment and loss , which has a temporal component in the form \nof simultaneity or coincidence in time .  I therefore agree in large part with Mr Plewman \nthat the requirement for conditionality and correspondence in Ukrainian law, along with \nits temporal component, is almost always incompatible with liability as a result of the \nindirect acquisition of property, and inevitably means that the necessa ry causal \nconnection must be a very close one.   It is evident that it will extend to cases such as \nPeasant Farm , but the facts must be that close . \n \nUnjust Enrichment: Ukrainian law : insufficient legal grounds  \n1621.

The next part of the legal analysis is the Bank ’s conten tion that the Corporate \nDefendants  received the Unreturned Prepayments without sufficient legal grounds .  It \nis said that they did so because it is common ground between Mr Beketov and Mr \nNahnybida that an enrichment will have been received without sufficient legal grounds \nif the recipient acquires property pursuant to a void transaction and the Relevant Loans \nand RSAs , pursuant to which the Corporate Defendants  obtained the Bank’s property \nare indeed  void. \n1622.  The Bank further submitted that the Corporate Defendants acted abusively in entering \ninto the RSAs and receiving the Unreturned Prepayments under the RSAs, such that \nthey are not entitled to rely upon them  as legal grounds for  their enrichment.  This \nsecond point reflects Mr Beketov’s evidence (based on the principles explained in \nparagraphs 862ff above) that,  if an acquirer relies upon a legal right as a defence to a \nclaim in unjust enrichment, the court may refuse to protect that right if it is being \nexercised abusively.  In other words, t he court may also refuse to enforce an otherwise \nvalid transaction if it concludes that the person relying upon the transaction is doing so \nabusively.   He explained that, if the RSAs were found to have been entered into with \nthe intention of harming the Bank’s rights  and were therefore abusive, those agreements \ncould not be relied upon as providing  the Corporate Defendants  with a lawful basis for \nreceiving the Unreturned Prepayments, even if the RSAs  were not void on the grounds \nalleged by  the Bank.  \n1623.  In the light of the conclusions I have already explained on voidness (see the section of \nthis judgment starting at paragraph 1006  above), I find that this element of the cause of \naction is satisfied.  \n1624.  In these circumstances, I am satisfied that a claim in unjust enrichment against the \nCorporate Defendants is theoretically available to the Bank in the sense that an indirect \nclaim is possible , if but only if the causal link is very close .  Under the law of Ukraine, \nthe causal relationship must comply with the requirements of coincidence and \nsimultaneity between the increase in the property of the Corporate Defendants and a \ncorresponding loss of property by the Bank.  I also think that Mr Beketov’s evidence  \nthat c hains of transfers that are causally linked together are  relevant to consider for the \npurposes of determining liability under Article 1212  is correct  in theory, but it will only \nbe in a situation akin to Peas ant Farm  that a claim will satisfy the test . \n1625.  It follows that I think  that the law of Ukraine does not permit a claim in unjust \nenrichment under Article 1212 to be made where the enrichment is as a result of a \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n394 \n causally -linked chain of transactions which are not both simul taneous and direct .  This \nleaves open the possibility (as occurred in Peasant Farm ) that there may be a third party \nin the chain through whom what would have otherwise been a direct transfer can be \nseen to pass , but it does not permit the court to circumvent the principles of simultaneity \nor coincidence .  I should add that it is necessary to leav e out of account proprietary \ntracing cases, which  are not proceedings under Article 121 2: that  is not the way that the \nBank puts its claim against the Corporate Defendants . \n1626.

I will deal with the question of whether and how that test is satisfied on the facts of this \ncase after considering the Cypriot law of unjust enrichment.  It is appropriate for me to \nmake findings on Cypriot law as well, in case I am wrong in my conclusion that the \nrestitutionary obligations arising out of the Bank’s claims in unjust enrichment are \nmanifestl y more closely connected with Ukraine than they are with Cyprus.  \n \nUnjust Enrichment: Cypriot  law \n1627.  The Bank’s claim s as a matter of Cypriot law are brought under section 70 of the \nContract Law  (“section 70”) , section 65 of the Contract Law  (“section 65”)  alternatively \nas a freestanding claim in unjust enrichment under the Cypriot common law.  \n1628.  Both the Bank and the Corporate Defendants adduced expert evidence from Cypriot \nlawyers.  The expert called by the Bank was  Stelios Nathanael, who served as a Judge \nin Cyprus for 33 years, the last 13 of which were spent on the Supreme Court bench \n(for a period of which he was the President).   Mr Nathanael  replaced the Bank’s original \nexpert, Petros Artemis  (also a former Supreme Court judge ), who died part way through \nthe proceedings . The expert called by the Corporate Defendants was Andreas \nErotocritou, w ho qualified as a Cypriot lawyer in 2007.  \n1629.  The Bank submit ted that, in circumstances where a large part of the dispute between \nthem is how the Cyprus Supreme Court would be likely to  interpret various issues if a \ncase such as the extant one were to come before it, the views of Mr Nathanael should \ncarry significantly more weight.  It also submitted that this was more particularly the \ncase, given that it was revealed in cross -examination that Mr Erotocritou had breached \nhis duty to the court as an expert by citing a passage from the Indian textbook, P ollock \nand Mulla : The Indian Contract and Specific Relief Acts , 16th ed (“Pollock & Mulla”) \n(a work which the experts agree is authoritative in Cyprus) , in support of his thesis that \nsection 65 did not provide for a claim for indirect enrichment, when another passage \nfrom that textbook reached the opposite conclusion.  \n1630.  I will come onto the substance of this particular point in due course, but Mr Plewman \nsaid that it was plain that  Mr Erotocritou  had missed the passage now relied upon \n(which had not been identified by Mr Nathanael), and the allegation of breach of duty \nhas been made on the basis of a preconceived assumption unsupported by the evidence. \nHaving re -read the passage from his cross exa mination on a number of occasions, I \naccept that this is an accurate reflection of what occurred.  Nonetheless, the way in \nwhich  Mr Erotocritou  dealt with the point gave me some concerns both as to the \nthoroughness of his research and to the fact that he seems to have concentrated too \nmuch on answering Mr Nathan ael’s evidence rather than ensuring that all of the points \nhe was required to address were fully ventilated in his report.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n395 \n 1631.  It was common ground between the experts that the starting point for interpreting the \nContract Law is the wording of the relevant provision and (reflecting section 2(1) of \nthe Contract Law) that a concept or term of the Contract Law should be interpreted i n \naccordance with English law principles of statutory interpretation, provided always that \nthe resulting interpretation is not inconsistent with the Contract Law itself (or another \nlaw or the Constitution) or the caselaw of the Supreme Court.

Both experts \nalso agreed that the English common law can be relied upon to interpret the Contract \nLaw to the extent there is no inconsistency and that there are a number  of cases in which \nthe Cypriot courts have turned to English law in support of reasoning on specific points \nof unjust enrichment.  \n1632.  Mr Erotocritou also accepted in cross -examination that as the principles of English legal \ninterpretation develop and evolve, so Cypriot law applying such principles will also \ndevelop and evolve and that, in the absence of Cypriot law on a particular point,  the \nCypriot courts can and will look to English law principles (and this Court is entitled to \ndo the same), saying: there “is nothing wrong with the Cyprus courts referring or \nquoting English case law … in order to touch [i.e. deal with] a specific point” . \n \nUnjust Enrichment: Cypriot  law: section 70  of the Contract Law  \n1633.  Section 70 provides as follows:  \n“Where a person lawfully does anything for another person, or  delivers anything to \nhim, not intending to do so gratuitously, and such other person enjoys the benefit \nthereof, the latter is bound to make compensation to the former in respect of or to \nrestore the thing so done or delivered. ” \n1634.  It is common ground that  the components of a claim under s ection 70 are that a lawful \nact must be done, for another person, by a person not intending to act gratuitously and \nthe person for whom the act is done must enjoy the benefit of it .  It is also common \ngrounds that a defendant is liable under s ection 70 even if the benefit was received in \nits capacity as agent in circumstances where the alleged principal was undisclosed or \nthe defendant was involved in a wrongful act or privy to a fraud or sham transa ction by \nwhich the benefit was conferred upon him.  \n1635.  The three main areas of disagreement identified by the Bank were  (a) whether section \n70 can apply in cases of ‘indirect’ enrichment; (b) the claimant must have intended to \nenrich the defendant; and ( c) whether  section 70 can apply in cases where the relevant \ntransaction is illegal.   Mr Erotocritou  said that the defendant  had to have been directly  \nenriched by the claimant, that the claimant must have intended to enrich the defendant \nand that the remedy was not available where the relevant transaction is ille gal. Mr \nNathan ael took the opposite view on each of those three points.  \n1636.  On the issue of indirect benefit, Mr Nathan ael’s conclusion was:  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n396 \n “I have no doubt that the Cypriot courts, like their English counterparts, would \nrecognise that the imposition of liability for unjust enrichment in circumstances of \nindirect enrichment is a sensible and just legal development, given especially that \nmodern  economic transactions are more complex and more readily carried out \nusing electronic means than was the case (or could have been envisaged) back in \n1931 when the Contract Law, Cap. 149, was enacted.”  \n1637.

Mr Nathan ael’s reference to “their English counterparts” was to three case s: Relfo Ltd \nv. Varsani [2015] 1 BCLC 14 at [97]  (where enrichment through a circuitous route was \ntreated as being in reality equivalent to a direct payment and demonstrated a sufficient \ncausal connection to support a remedy in unjust enrichment); Menelaou v . Bank of \nCyprus UK Ltd  [2016] A.C. 176 at [27]  (where the question in each case is said to be \nwhether there is a sufficient causal connection, in the sense of a sufficient nexus or link, \nbetween the loss to the Bank and the benefit received by the defendant); and Investment \nTrust Companies v . Revenue and Customs Comrs  [2018] A.C. 275 at [4 8] (in which it \nwas held that a set of co -ordinated transactions can be treated as forming a single \nscheme or transaction for the purpose of the “at the expense of” inquiry, on the basis \nthat to consider each individual transaction separately would b e unrealistic).  \n1638.  Mr Erotocritou  disagreed.   On the basis of his evidence, the Corporate Defendants  \nsubmitted that on its plain construction, section 70  cannot apply to indirect transfers \ngenerally, and in particular cannot apply to the Looped Connection transactions \ncharacteristic of this case .  It was said that the person who is bound to restore the benefit \nis the person who  both received it from the claimant and the person to whom it was \ndelivered.   It was also said  that the claimant must have know n at the point of transf er \nthat it was making the transfer to the defendant.   I agree that the language of section 70 \ncontemplate s an identity between the person who receives  the enrichm ent and the \nperson bound to restore or make compensation for the receipt  but, as Mr Erotocritou  \nagreed, it does not s pell out whether what is delivered must be direct or whether it is \nsufficient i f it comes through an indirect route . \n1639.  Mr Erotocritou  also said that  adopting Mr Nathan ael’s approach  would be inconsistent \nwith the decision of Sekavin SA v. The Ship \"Platon Ch\" and Others  (1987) 1 CLR 297  \n(“Sekavin ”) and would require the Supreme Court of Cyprus to depart from its previous \ncaselaw .  He was of the view that departing from Sekavin  would not be justified, as  the \nprinciples set out in the judgment are not \"undoubtedly wrong\" and remain in line with \nthe express wording of section  70.  He also said that s uch an interpretation would not \nlead to injustice as the law of Cyprus  provides  for a num ber of alternative causes of \naction that may enable a claimant  to recover against a person who had been indirectly \nenriched as a result of a wrongdoing.  \n1640.  Sekavin concerned a claim by a fuel supplier to a ship against both the ship and the \nmortgagees of the ship who had taken over the ship pursuant to the terms of the \nmortgage. Prior to enforcing the mortgage, the claimant had delivered the fuel to the \nship and the ownership of the fuel had passed from the claimant to the ship. When the \nmortgagees took over the ship at a subsequent stage, they had effectively benefitted \nfrom the fuel. The claimant raised a claim against both the ship and the mortgagees for \nunjust enrichment. The mortgagees applied to set aside service of the proceedings \noutside the jurisdiction on the ground that \"no cause of action\" was disclosed against \nthem. The court held that  section 70 “reproduces the common law principles of quasi \ncontractual liability of the recipient of goods or services supplied or rendered non-\nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n397 \n gratuitously; whereupon an obligation i"}

Mr Nathan ael pointed out that Sekavin  was very different from the facts of the present \ncase.  The mortgagee was not found as a matter of fact to have received a benefit and \nthe case made no finding on the issue of whether a benefit received indirectly can be \nthe subject of a claim in unjust enrichment.   He said that neither the parties in the case, \nnor the court, are recorded as having made submissions on, or discussed, any issue of \ndirect or indirect transfer or enrichment.  He also said that it was not a case involving a \ncomplex series of transactions found to be a sham , nor was it a case of a set of \ncoordinated transactions constituting a single scheme.  \n1642.  Mr Erotocritou accepted that , whether an indirect benefit would  suffice for the purposes \nof section 70 is a matter of interpretation of that provision  and that  nothing in the \nexpress wording of s ection 70 requires the benefit received by a defendant to have been \nconferred directly upon them by a claimant .  He also accepted that his position was \nbased on an inference (by which he meant that his reading of the section as a whole did \nnot contemplate the involvement of a third person), rather than the express l anguage of \nthe section, and that  the Cypriot Supreme Court has not had occasion to rule on a case \ninvolving a sham series of transactions or a single composite scheme and has therefore \nnot been called upon to interpret or apply English case law in that context.   As to the \nSupreme Court cases on which he did rely, Mr Erotocritou  agreed that none of them  \nexpressly deal t with the issue of indirect benefit  and, apart from Sekavin , there “is no \nother Cyprus case law in relation to indirectness” .  He also accepte d that the  remaining \nauthorities to which he referred  were not cases concerning indirect benefits and that  \nSekavin  was a “very different case” to the English cases .  However, he also relied on \nPollock & Mulla ( the Indian Contract and Specific Relief Act  has a provision in \nidentical terms to section 70),  and which explains at §70.23 that “the benefit must be \ndirect and not indirect, i.e., directly derived by the person for whom the work is done”  \n1643.  In these circumstances, I see the force of Mr Nathan ael’s view that, in the right \ncircumstances and having regard to the Cypriot courts’ approach to the application of \nEnglish law principles in interpreting the Contract Law, a benefit or enrichment \nconferred upon a defendant indirectly is capable of  suffic ing for the purposes of section \n70.  I find that this is indeed the law of Cyprus , anyway in very closely confined \ncircumstances .  I also agree that such circumstances are capable of  includ ing those in \nwhich a defendant has received a benefit indirectly from the claimant by way of an \nintervening transaction which is found to be a sham and where the defendant received \na benefit indirectly from the claimant by way of co -ordinated transactions forming a \nsingle  scheme.  This reflects developments in the common law of both England and \nCyprus which the court in Sekavin  explicitly recognised as by and large being reflected \nin section 70 . \n1644.

This reflects developments in the common law of both England and \nCyprus which the court in Sekavin  explicitly recognised as by and large being reflected \nin section 70 . \n1644.  The second area of dispute is Mr Erotocritou ’s statement that “ [b]ased on  the caselaw \ninterpreting section 70 of the Contract Law, Cap.149, the phrase \"for another person\" \nrequires the claimant to establish that it intended to enrich the defendant\". In support of \nthis proposition he again referre d to Pollock & Mulla, in which, commenting on the \nphrase \"for another person\" as  used in the Indian legislative provision equivalent to \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n398 \n section 70 , the authors expressed the view that this means the claimant must have \nintended to enrich the defendant.  \n1645.  Mr Nathan ael’s position was that there is no Cypriot case law suggesting that a claimant \nmaking an unjust enrichment claim (whether expressed with or without reference to \nsection 70) must establish that he intended to enrich the defendant. He said that there is \nsimp ly no such statutory requirement and he did not consider that this proposition can \nbe read into section 70 or be the natural consequence of the words \"for another person.\"  \nIn his opinion those words simply require that the claimant has done an a ct as a result \nof which the other person has received a benefit.  \n1646.  It was not clear to me that the second disputed question remained in issue, because it \nwas not developed in the Corporate Defendants’ written or oral submissions.  If it is, I \nagree with the Bank’s case.  While section 70 requires that the person doing the  relevant \nthing does not intend to do so gratuitously, Mr Erotocritou accepted that there is nothing \nin section 70 which explicitly requires the claimant to have intended to enrich the \ndefendant.  He cited no Cypriot authority in support of his proposition  that a claimant \nmust have such an intention.  I agree that, if the point were to have been pursued, Mr \nNathanael’s view, which is that the section simply provides that an unjust enrichment \nclaim will not lie where the claimant intended the defendant to re ceive the enrichment \nwithout adequate reimbursement of value,  is to be preferred. There is no requirement \nthat a claimant under section 70 needs to establish that he intended to enrich the \ndefendant.  \n1647.  The third disputed issue identified by the Bank was whether  section 70 can apply in \ncases where the relevant transaction is illegal.   It was agreed between the experts that \n“[w]here the claimant is unaware or is not party to the illegality the Cyprus Courts will \nnot refuse a remedy” under section 70.  The Bank submitted that it therefore followed \nthat, if a claimant is party to an agre ement or transaction which is prima facie legal, but \nwhich is in fact tainted by illegality, the claimant will not be barred from bringing a \nclaim under section 70 if he is unaware of , and not party to, the illegality.  I think in the \nend there was not very much between the experts on this point.  \n1648.  Mr Nathanael accepted that the law of Cyprus has a strict approach to turpitude and \nthat, in circumstances where both parties act unlawfully or in bad faith, any claim would \nbe rejected by the Cypriot Courts on ex turpi causa  grounds.  However he made clear \nthat those principles would not preclude an unjust enrichment claim where the \ndefendant has been enriched at the claimant's expense by means of a fraudulent or sham \nagreement (or series of agreements) pursuant to which funds moved fro m the claimant \nto the  defendant, assuming the claimant had no k"}

In other words the touchstone for the denial of relief in such cases is \nnot the illegality of the transaction per se, but the bad faith of the claimant.  This \nproposition was supported by a number of authorities and, in my view, accurately \nreflects the law of Cyprus.  \n1649.  However, the Corporate Defendants went on to submit that, for any claim in  unjust \nenrichment to succeed under Cyp riot law the court must conclude that the Bank was an \ninnocent party , but that, as at 2014  when the enrichment is said to have occurred, it is \nplain it was not.   It was submitted that the fact that the Bank, under its new  post-\nnationalisation management, has a different perspective on the advisability of Bank’s \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n399 \n effecting the  Relevant Drawdowns cannot affect this analysis.  It was said that it cannot \nbe right that a claim would fail if decided in 2016, but would succeed in 2017.  \n1650.  The Bank disagreed with this analysis.  It submitted that, although they were void for \nthe reasons I have already explained,  there was nothing illegal about the loans \nthemselves on their face and that, because the Individual Defendants and all of the other \nindividuals who participated in the scheme were acting mala fide  and the Bank was the \nvictim of the Misappropriation, their guilty knowledge could not be attributed to the \nBank.  \n1651.  This aspect of the argument was not really developed in submission s, and there may be \nan issue arising as to  the law which governs the question of whether the state of mind \nof those involved in the Misappropriation can be attributed to the Bank for this purpose.  \nIt may be Ukrainian law as the law governing the Bank’s constitution or Cypriot law as \nthe law gover ning (on this basis) the restitutionary obligation.  The parties did not \ngrapple with these issues in this context, but I think it is possible to re ach a conclusion \nbecause they bear a close similarity to the question of the Bank’s awareness of the facts \nof the claims that were available to it for limitation purposes, which I deal with \nelsewhere in this judgment.  \n1652.  In that context, it was always accepted by the Defendants that the knowledge of the \nMisappropriation could not be attributed to the Bank through the Individual Defendants \nor anybody else who was implicated in the Misappropriation and that no innocent \nmembe rs of senior management had the necessary awareness for limitation purposes \nbefore the active stage of the Misappropriation came to an end and the last of the \nRelevant Drawdowns was made.  I do not see how it can be said that , if the Bank had \nno awareness for limitation purposes, it is nonetheless to be treated as having \nknowledge sufficient to be aware of the even potentially unlawful nature of what was \ngoing on  (or otherwise to have been acting in bad faith so as to give the Corporate \nDefendants a defence to the claim in restitution ) during the period in which the Relevant \nDrawdowns were still being made  \n1653.  I therefore agree that, as a matter of principle, section 70 would be available as a legal \nbasis for a claim in this case.

This issue applies to all of the unjust enrichment \nclaims, whether they a rise under Ukrainian or Cypriot law, and I shall come to it after \nI have expressed my conclusions on the other ways in which the Ban k puts its case.  \n \nUnjust Enrichment: Cypriot  law: section 65  of the Contract Law  \n1654.  The Bank’s claim in unjust enrichment against the Corporate Defendants is also made \nunder section 65:  \n“When an agreement is discovered to be void, or when a contract becomes void, \nany person who has received any advantage under such agreement or contract is \nbound to restore it, or to make compensation for it, to the person from whom he \nreceived it. ” \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n400 \n 1655.  Initially, t he experts had disagreed as to  (a) whether the “void agreement” must be \nbetween the claimant and the defendant , (b) whether s ection 65 applies to cases of \n‘indirect’ enrichment  and (c) the impact of illegality.   In their written closing \nsubmissions, the Corporate Defendants put the argument slightly differently.  They said \nthat, if what occurred was simply what the Bank’s counsel had called a Papering \nExercise, then section 65 necessarily cannot be engaged, because the Relevant Loans \nand RSAs we re then not ‘real’ “agreements” at all for the purposes of section 65.  They \nrelied on Pollock & Mulla at p.1015 which notes: “… section 65 starts because of there \nbeing some agreement or contract between competent parties. It has no application to a \ncase in which there never was, and never could have been, any contract”.  \n1656.  It was also submitted in support of the first two disputed points that section 65 cannot \nbe engaged in cases such as the present, because  the Unreturned Prepayments were not \nan advantage received by the Corporate Defendants  “under” the Relevant Loans , as \nsection 65 expressly requires.    It was said that the Bank’s claim seeks to engage section \n65 by stitching together two sets of contracts (i.e., the Relevant Loans and the RSAs) \nin a manner not contemplated by the wording of the section. This was said to mean that , \nsave in exceptional circumstances , its operation is necessarily confined to direct \nenrichment , a proposition which is reinforced by the liability being to restore or  make \ncompensation for the advantage “to the person from whom he received it”.   It was said \nthat, i n all but exceptional circumstances, those requirements can only be satisfied \nwhere the (void) agreement was between the claimant and the defendant directly.   It \nalso followed that tortious concepts of causation can have no role in the app lication of \nsection 65 and that the  only persons from whom the Corporate Defendants received  the \nUnreturned Prepayments were the Borrowers, who were therefore the only proper \nclaimants.  \n1657.  Mr Nathanael’s view was that the agreement or contract in question does not have to \nbe between the claimant and defendant.  He relied on the wording of section 65 which \nprovides that “any person”, not “any party”, must restore a benefit received under a \nvoid contract, and pointed out that the use of “person” stands in contrast to other \nprovisions of the Contract Law which specifically refer to a “party” (e.g., the \nimmediately preceding sections 62 and 64).  He also relied on the same English law \nauthorities  on the effect of sham intermediary transactions and transactions which form \npart of a single composite scheme as he had referred t"}

He also relied on the same English law \nauthorities  on the effect of sham intermediary transactions and transactions which form \npart of a single composite scheme as he had referred to in the context of his evidence \non section 70.  \n1658.  He also expressed himself forcefully in his report to the following effect:  \n“So, for example, if an enrichment has passed from a claimant to a defendant via a \nseries of sham agreements, I am certain that the Cypriot courts would not deny an \notherwise just claim brought under section 65 on the basis that there was a series \nof sham a greements between the claimant and defendant, rather than a single sham \nagreement to which both were party. ” \n1659.  The Bank also relied (although it seemed that Mr Nathan ael had not) on the academic \ncommentary in Pollock and Mullah and which was the passage that Mr  Erotocritou  had \nfailed to refer to and caused the Bank to accuse him of acting in breach of duty (see \nparagraph 1630  above):  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n401 \n “The obligation under this section to restore the advantage received under an \nagreement is not confined to parties to the agreement, but extends to any person \nthat may have received the advantage.”  \n1660.  This reflected a case in the Allahabad High Court  (Kazi Hamid Ali vs Girraj Bakhsh  \n(1887) ILR 9 All 340 ), in which Edge CJ had said:  \n“It appears to me that in this view of Section 18, the provisions of Section 65 of the \nContract Act would apply. That Section provides that \"when an agreement is \ndiscovered to be void, or when a contract becomes void, any person who has \nreceived any advant age under such agreement or contract is bound to restore it or \nmake compensation for it, to the person from whom he received it.\" It has been \nsuggested that this Section should be read as if the person making restitution should \nactually have been a party t o the contract; but the Section is expressed in the widest \nterms, and includes any person whatever who has obtained any advantage under a \nvoid agreement.”  \n1661.  The Corporate Defendants submitted that this case did not help , because the benefits \nhad clearly been received directly from the claim ant and in that sense “under” the \nagreement and that no Cypriot case ha d been identified in which section 65 was applied \nwhere the agreement was with a different party (i.e., not the defendant).   They also \nrelied on a decision of the Supreme Court of Cyprus in  Ioannides as Administrator of \nEstate Haralampidis v . Archdiocese of Cyprus  (13 January 2020), in which i t was held \nthat section 65 could not apply in the circumstances of the case for two simple reasons: \nthat there was no agreement between the parties and that the Appellants had failed to \nprove any benefit allegedly received by the Respondent.   There was some debate about \nthis case during the course of the trial, not least because the Supreme Court was presided \nover by Mr Nathan ael when judgment was delivered .  However I think it is reasonably \nclear that it was an essential part of the reasoning that the absence of any  agreement \nbetween the parties , or between the respondents and one of the appellants to the appeal , \nwas the essential reason  that the counterclaim for restitution could not succeed . \n1662.  I have not found this an easy point , but I prefer M r Erotocritou ’s evidence.

Although \nPollock & Mullah clearly consider that the law should be developed along these lines , \nIoannides  seems to be clear authority that it has not yet taken that course , while the use \nof the word “under” indicates that the draftsman only had in mind a single void \nagreement to which enricher and enriched were both party .  Mr Nathan ael’s evidence \nas to the distinction between party and person has some force , although it s significance \nis reduced somewhat by the way in which “ person” is used in the preceding section \n(section 64 ) as an obvious reference to a party  exercising his power to rescind a voidable \nagree ment . In summary , I am not persuaded that this is a provision to which such a wide \nconstruction will be  given  under Cypriot law , which is the tenor of the evidence given \nby Mr Nathan ael.  I therefore find that, if the matter were to come before a Cypriot \ncourt , it would determine that , for the purposes of section 65 , both enricher and enriched \nmust be party to one or more  agreement s which are found to be void . \n1663.  As to the impact of illegality on the cause of action, Mr Erotocritou had originally said \nthat the courts have traditionally not permitted the recovery of any benefit which was \nobtained “in the frames of the illegal agreement or contract”.  It is not very clear what \nhe meant by that, although the phrase seems to have been picked up from an academic \ncommentary.  In the event I think it is clear that, as with section 70, the true rule is the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n402 \n one originally espoused by Mr Nathan ael, i.e., that  if the claimant was unaware of any \nillegality in the transaction, and acted bona fide , then the Cypriot courts would not \nrefuse that claimant a restitutionary remedy in respect of any benefit passing under that \ntransaction, even if ultimately it is demonstrated that the transaction is tainted by \nillegality.   The same answ er therefore appl ies on this issue, as the answer I have already \ngiven in relation to section 70. \n \nUnjust Enrichment: Cypriot  law: an independent cause of action  \n1664.  The third alternative basis for the Bank’s claim in unjust enrichment under Cypriot law \nwas Mr Nathanael’s view  that such a cause of action is available outside the scope of \nthe Contract Law  and that, upon being presented with an opportunity to do so, the \nCypriot courts will explicitly recognise that an independent cause of action in unjust \nenrichment can exist.   In this context, counsel for the Corporate Defendants submitted \nthat the court must be careful to ensure that it carries out the correct exercise when \nconsidering possible developments in a foreign law.  In SFO v . Litigation Capital  \n[2021] EWHC 1272 (Comm), Foxton J  gave a concise and helpful summary of the \ncourt’s task in the following passage from his judgment at [529]:  \n“This is clearly an interesting point of Jersey law concerning the interaction of \nproperty and trusts law in the context of trustee fraud which is not subject to any \ndirect Jersey authority, and on which there is much to be said on both sides. As \nSimon J h eld in Yukos Capital , the role of the court in these circumstances is to \ndecide what conclusion the foreign court would reach on a developing area of the \nlaw, not to seek to anticipate a rational development in the foreign law or decide \nwhat the law should  be.” \n1665.  The Corporate Defendants also drew attention to the fact that Mr Nathan ael had \nconfirmed in cross -examination that a standalone cause of action would involve a \n“development of the law” and had said in his second report that:  \n“I have no doubt that the C"}

The Corporate Defendants also drew attention to the fact that Mr Nathan ael had \nconfirmed in cross -examination that a standalone cause of action would involve a \n“development of the law” and had said in his second report that:  \n“I have no doubt that the Cypriot courts, like their English counterparts, would \nrecognise that the imposition of liability for unjust enrichment in circumstances of \nindirect enrichment is a sensible and just legal development” (emphasis added)  \nI do not think that this takes matters very much further.  Indeed that statement seems to \nme seems to me to be entirely consistent with a conclusion that a Cypriot court would \ndecide, in this  developing area , that a free -standing cause of action in unjust enrichment \ndoes indeed exist under Cypriot law.  \n1666.  The Corporate Defendants also relied on the fact that, in their joint statement, the \nexperts agreed that “[I]n no case so far has the Supreme Court of Cyprus acknowledged \nunjust enrichment as an autonomous cause of action”.  However, that of itself does no t \ntake matters very much further either, because Mr Nathan ael advanced his opinion as \nconsistent with (although not explicitly decided in) two Cypriot Supreme Court \nauthorities in which claims in unjust enrichment were considered without any reference \nto the Contract Law.  While the Supreme Court did not expressly acknowledge an \nautonomous cause of action, these cases proceeded on the basis of general principles of \nunjust enrichment as articulated in the English authorities.  That factor alone means that \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n403 \n they are some support for a decision on the conclusion which the Cypriot court is likely \nto reach on a developing area of the law, rather than a  decision as to what a rational \ndevelopment in the law  should be . \n1667.  Indeed, I think that Mr Nathan ael was correct to draw attention to what he said was the \nmodern approach of the Cypriot courts, in one of those cases.  His evidence was that \nthe law has developed in the last 20 years and now aims to give full effect to the \nprinciples of unjust enrichment  and restitution as developed under English law.  He \ngave a detailed explanation of why that was the case.  In particular he said that in Nakis \nTheocharidis v . Ioannou  (2012) 1 CLR 1311 (“ Theocharidis ”) (in which he had been \non the panel as a judge but dis sented on the facts), when considering a counterclaim for \nrestitution, the majority had spelt out that three prerequisites must be satisfied for an \nunjust enrichment claim: (i) the defendant must have been enriched by the receipt of a \nbenefit, (ii) the ben efit must have been received at the expense of the claimant, and (iii) \nit must be unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit.  This statement of principle, \ntogether with its detailed discussion of the common law, was explicitly drawn from \nEnglish autho rity, without reference to any grounding in Cypriot statute (whether \nsection 70, section 65 or otherwise) and in a factual context in which neither of those \nprovisions would have applied.  \n1668.  Although Theocharidis  failed on the facts, in m y view  it is strong support for Mr \nNathanael’s opinion that the Supreme Court would conclude, if asked, that there is a \nfree standing cause of action in unjust enrichment available under the law of Cyprus, \nwhich operates independently of both section 70 and section 65 , and that the starting \npoint for any consideration of the elements of the cause of action will be the English \nprinciples of unjust enrichment, including those relied on by Mr Nathan ael in the \nevidence I have referred to in paragraph 1637  above.  \n166"}

For his part, and despite what he had said in his report, Mr Erotocritou accepted in cross \nexamination that the claims considered in the two authorities (one of which was \nTheocharidis ) would not in any event have fallen within the scope of sections 65 or 70.  \nBut he did not accept that the reason they failed was because they did not satisfy the \nrequirements set out in the English case law. I think he was wrong about that.  In my \nview t hey both support Mr Nathan ael’s evidence that an independent cause of act ion in \nunjust enrichment exist s under the law of Cyprus and will be recognised by the Cypriot \ncourts when the opportunity arises.  It is consistent with the fact, accepted by Mr \nErotocritou, that the Contract Law is not exhaustive and some aspects of claims in \nunjust enrichment, such a s defences, have no grounding in the statutory language.  They \nare therefore governed solely by case law and common law principles.  It is also \nsupported by Mr Nathanael’s unchallenged opinion that it is common practice before  \nthe Cypriot Courts to file claims based on unjust enrichment seeking restitution without \nany reference to the Contract Law.  \n1670.  I also do not think that this evidence is necessarily answered by Mr  Erotocritou’s \ncitation of a number of authorities  such as Panagiotis Kitsis v . Attorney General of \nCyprus  (2001) 1 SCD  (AAD)1077 , Ioannou v . Charalambous  (2012) 1 SCD (AAD) \n507, Archippea v . Demetriou  (Civil Appeal 298/10, dated 15/10/15 , Alkiviades v . The \nPhillips College  (Civil Appeal No 310/11 dated 21.3.2017 ) which conclude that the \nCyprus Supreme Court has not yet recognised an independent/autonomous cause of \naction in unjust enrichment .  While they proceed on the basis that no general and \nconsolidated category based on unjust enrichment has yet been recogni sed in Cyprus, \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n404 \n they are not inconsistent with a conclusion that more general restit utionary principles \nwould be articulated into conclusions which the Cyprus  court would reach if these \nmatters were to be heard before it.  \n1671.  However, I have reached the conclusion that this point in time has not yet been reached , \nand in any event I think it more likely that it will be developed through the structure of \nsection 70, with the consequ ences that I have already described.  In that regard, it is \nstriking that an authority to which my attention was drawn (again decided by Mr \nNathan ael: Zenios Limited v . Touch Properties and Investments  Civil Appeal No \n484/2012 dated 10.6.2019 ) is consistent with that being the position .  In that case the \njudge who again was Mr Nathan ael said:  \n“It is legally known that the legal ground of the claim for damages on the basis of \nunjust enrichment is founded on article 70 of the Law on Contracts, Chapter 149. \nThis article provides for unjust enrichment and restitution outside and irrespective \nof any contractual framework or where the framework fails. Article 70 incorporates \nthe principles of law on leniency known as unjust enrichment and restitution. For \nrestitution, the enrichment must, inter alia, be unjustified ” \n1672.  In all these circumstances, I prefer Mr Erotocritou’ s evidence on this point although  I \nagree that Mr Nathan ael’s opinion is a genuine reflection of what he think s the law of \nCyprus ought to be  and may well become in due course . It is clear to me t"}

In all these circumstances, I prefer Mr Erotocritou’ s evidence on this point although  I \nagree that Mr Nathan ael’s opinion is a genuine reflection of what he think s the law of \nCyprus ought to be  and may well become in due course . It is clear to me that, if the time \ncomes, i n the light of Theocharidis , the elements of the cause of action are likely to be \ndeveloped by a Cypriot court in accordance with the principles developed and \nestablished under English law  but within the confines of section 70 . \n \nUnjust Enrichment: Cypriot  law: change of position and remedy  \n1673.  It was not in dispute between the experts that the defences of ministerial receipt and \nchange of position apply under Cypriot law. However, it was accepted in the Corporate \nDefendants’ closing submissions that any such defence s would not be available if they \nthemselves acted in bad faith.   In light of the conclusions I have reached in relation to \nthe role of the Corporate Defendants in the loan recycling scheme and the \nMisappropriation, and the control of the Individual Defendants to which they were \nsubject , I am satisfied  that no such defence is available to them, even though there is \nevidence which I have considered (in amongst other places paragraphs 1554 ff above ) \nin relation to the onward transmission of the Unreturned Prepayments to others.  \n1674.  One further issue which arose in respect of all of the Cypriot law claims related to \nremedy.  It was accepted by both experts that there is a general principle of Cypriot law \nthat the remedy in a claim for unjust enrichment is restitution by reference to the gain \nmade by the defe ndant, not by reference to the claimant’s loss.  This is the English law \nposition and, as Mr Erotocritou accepted, the Cypriot courts would look to, and apply, \nthe English law position.  But the Corporate Defendants said that there was a more \ncomplex point , which related to the extent to which the Corporate Defendants’ gain is \nproperly to be regarded a s being at the expense of the Bank (and therefore unjust \nenrichment for which the Bank can claim).  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n405 \n 1675.  This point is said to arise because the  Bank claims against each of the Corporate \nDefendants  in the US $ amounts of the Unreturned Prepayments each  of them  received, \nnotwithstanding that some of the Relevant Drawdowns provided by the Bank , which \nare said to have caused those Unreturned Prepayments , were in UAH, while others were \nin US$ . For those in UAH, there was a separate currency conversion effected by  the \nBorrowers after their receipt of the Relevant Drawdowns: i.e., after the Bank had \ntransferred away its property. It was then said that, o wing to currency fluctuations, there \nis now a significant difference in value in US $ terms between the US$ amounts received \nby the Corporate Defendants  and the UAH amounts the Bank transferred away  on the \nmaking of the Relevant Drawdowns .  Mr Plewman called this the “Dollar Differential ” \nand said that it affects the English Defendants and Milbert,  with an aggregate effect of \na windfall to the Bank of c.US $521 million  if the Corporate Defendants are ordered to \npay the Do llar Differential to the Bank.  \n1676.

In the light of my conclusions on Cypriot and Ukrainian law , the principal factual \nquestion relates to drawing the appropriate link between the payment made by the Bank \n(i.e., the Relevant Drawdown) and the receipt by the Corporate Defendants (i.e. , the \nrelevant Unreturned Prepayment).   As I have endeavoured to show , the test for the \nappropriate link is different under Ukrainian  law from the test under Cypriot law, which \nis different again from English law.  It is therefore important that the court should n ot \nbecome sidetracked  on a discussion of how the facts fit into English law principles \nwhen they are not the principle s I am required to apply . \n1678.  The Bank’s starting point is that, through receipt of the Unreturned Prepayments the \nCorporate Defendants have been enriched at the expense of the Bank and such \nenrichment is unjust , because there has been a total failure of the basis upon which the \nUnreturned Prepayments were indirectly transferred to them from the Bank . \n1679.  The Corporate Defendants’ essential answer  is that, even if there could be claims for \nindirect enrichment in principle  (which I have determined there can be under both \nsystems of law) , the features of the Corporate Defendants’  receipt of the Unreturned \nPrepayments are so extreme as to  be far outside any principled boundaries for claims \nalleging indirect enrichment.  The critical point made by the Corporate Defendants was \nthat what occurred is a world away from a co -ordinated transaction by which property \nor a benefit is indirectly transferred from A  to C via B.  \n1680.  The Bank’s response was that, if it were to be correct that the facts of this case were too \n“extreme”, only the most straightforward transfers of benefit could give rise to an unjust \nenrichment claim, which would be what Mr Anderson called “a charter for m oney \nlaunderers to make their transactions as complex as possible to avoid liability, which is \npretty much what the defendants have done in this case”.  He went on to submit that, if \na causal connection can be established, and if as a matter of law the enr ichment was at \nthe expense of the claimant, even if indirect, then the enquiry begins and ends there.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n406 \n 1681.  The Corporate Defendants submitted that the features of the Bank’s case as to \nenrichment are striking and no doubt were a product of  what Mr Plewman called  “the \ncontorted analysis of the transactions it has found necessary to put forward so as to \nmaintain its claims for tortious loss against  the Individual Defendants ”.  He identified \nthree features.  The first was what he called “I gnoring transactional reality in favour of \npresented narrative ”, by which I think he meant that the Bank ’s case ignored the \nevidence of what in fact happened.  The second he called “ No coordination and \nplanning beyond high level operation of the general scheme ” and the third he identified \nas being that the Corporate Defendants were not the ultimate transf erees.  \n1682.  As to the first , he said that in relation to the vast majority of Looped Connections, the \nBank’s case is entirely premised on treating the links identified by its own m ethodology \nas the transactional reality, ignoring  the fact that the monies used by the Borrowers to \nmake the Unreturned Prepayments were not the actual funds drawn down by the \nRelevant Drawdown s.

On the basis of a funds flow analysis, this is correct  and gives \nrise to an immediate issue under Ukrainian law , because , in many cases , the \nrequirements of the very limited degree of indirectness  that are permitted under \nUkrainian law,  together with the need to show simultaneity and coincidence will not be \nmet.  It is possible that  as a matter of Cypriot law, the require ments of section 70 will \nbe met, because there will be cases in which a Corporate D efendant has received an \nUnreturned Prepayment  indirectly from the Bank  by way of an intervening transaction \nwhich is found to be a sham , but on the basis of the evidence I discussed in paragraphs \n1545 ff above, that will not often be the case.  \n1683.  It seems to me that t he law of any country needs to be very careful in this area because , \nwhere a restitutionary claim lies against a transferee beyond the Borrowers, there is a \ndanger that the same enrichment will head in more than one direction.  In this case, that \nis illustrated by the consequences of the two different methodologies adopted by the \nBank and the Defendants : on the one hand there is  Mr Kolomoisky’s funds -flow or \nproprietary tracing  methodology  and on the other there is the Bank ’s methodology \nbased on a causal ly linked chain of trans actions  chain .  As will have appeared , I am \nquite satisfied that the Bank’s methodology is the correct one for the claims under \nArticle 1166, but that is not necessarily the case where the court is seeking to identify \nan enrichment which  is not direct but which still can be identi fied.  \n1684.  The highest it could be put, even if the court was in a position to apply the  principle s \nset out by Lord Reed in ITC v . Revenue and Customs  [2018] AC 275 at [46]-[47] in this \ncase, is that it must be shown that the difference from the direct provision of a benefit \nby the claimant to the defendant is more apparent than real .  In my view that sort of \nconsideration is simply not applicable to what occurred in many of the  Looped \nConnections to which my attention was drawn . The transactions were complex and \nthere were often long time gaps between steps  which cut across the requirement for \nsimulta neity and coincidence .  \n1685.  In his report Mr Thompson explained that , under each of the 54 RSAs, there were \nbetween one and six prepayments  between the initial prepayment s made from a \nRelevant Drawdown in respect of a supply agreement wit h another supplier  and the \nfinal Unreturned Prepayment  to one of the Corporate Defendants.  In the case of the \nLooped Connections, there is no evidence of a pre -plan to eventually cycle  the funds \ndrawdown to a specific Corporate Defendant, which in my view would make it  very \ndifficult to show that  in this category of case “ the difference from the direct provision \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n407 \n of a benefit by the Bank to the Corporate Defendants is more apparent than real ”.  \nLikewise it is obvious that the requirements of simultaneity and coincidence cannot be \nmet. \n1686.  Two example s suffice  to illustrate the point:  \ni) Tekhspets obtained a Relevant Drawdown on 8 November 2013 .  It was then \ncycled twice to Prior Management and Spircom Investments  and to Collyer as \nan Unreturned Prepayment. The Unreturned Prepayment to Collyer took place \nover 8 months later on 28 July 20 14. \nii) AEF made two Relevant Drawdowns on and after 27 December 2013 .

It may be the case that the position is c learer in relation to the No -Looped Connections , \nalthough the Corporate Defendants submitted that , even they remain indirect  and far \noutside the compass of the Bank’s analysis of Peasant Farm . The reason for this is that \nthe actual funds drawn down have not been conventionally traced through to the \nCorporate Defendants and it is said that t he connection is only presentational and not \nreal.  What they mean by that is that  the Borrower’s payment to the Corporate \nDefendant is narratively identified as relating to an RSA for which there is no re cord of \nrepayment to that Borrower. But they say that this presentational connection is \ninsufficient when the Bank’s  own case is that it was all part of a disguise to falsely \npresent the Relevant Drawdown monies as having been lost at the point of the \nUnreturned Prepayments . \n1688.  I do not accept that submission.  On the evidence before the court, i n that category of \ncase, I think it li kely that the Ukrainian law requirements of simultaneity and \ncoincidence will be met , because the Relevant Drawdown and the Unreturned \nPrepayment were made at the same time and were sufficiently linked for the purpose .  \nOn the face of it , there is a straightforward claim in unjust enrichment against t he \nrecipient Corporate Defendant for the amount of the Unreturned Payment received and \nI find that such has been established .  I have not however heard argument on precisely \nwhich of the other Unreturned Prepayments will be captured by this determination , or \nas to the interrelationship between my conclusions on this issue and the extent of the \ncompensation which the Corporate Defendants are liable to pay under Article 1166 . \n \nThe Limitation Defence : Overview  \n1689.  It is a central part of the Defendants’ defence that the Bank’s Ukrainian law claims are \nbarred by the expiry of a limitation period.  I identified the parameters of the defence at \nthe beginning of this judgment (paragraphs 43 and 44 above).  Under the law of \nUkraine, the limitation  period for claims under Article 1166 is three years and runs from \nthe date on which a person became, or could have become , aware of a violation of his \nright or the person who violated such right.  Each of the Defendants contends that the \nBank  became, or could have become aware of the relevant violation from a date more \nthan three years before the issue of these proceedings on 21 December 2017.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n408 \n 1690.  The main burden of the argument on this defence was undertaken by counsel for Mr \nKolomoisky , and Mr Bogolyubov was content to rely on what they said , although Ms \nMontgomery made some short supplementary oral submission s in closing .  The \nCorporate Defendants made their own separate written submissions , but they were \nlimited  to (a) some differences between  their position  and that of the Individual \nDefendants  and (b)  a fall-back argument made by the Bank in relation to the \ndisapplication of the limitation period for English public policy reasons .  Otherwise  the \nCorporate Defendants  adopted Mr Kolomoisky’s arguments in relation to the \nunderlying principles . \n1691.

Subject to the fall -back argument, i t was not in issue that the Ukrainian law of limitation \nis applicable to the Bank’s Ukrainian law claims.  Article 256 of the Civil Code defines \nthe limitation period as the “term within which a person may bring a claim before a \ncourt for the protection of its civil right or interest” and was described by the experts in \ntheir joint statement as part of  the substantive law provisions set forth in the Civil Code.   \nThe parties’ experts also all agreed that, for the purposes of the Bank’s claims under \nArticle 1166, Article 1190 and Article 1212 (i.e., the claims in both tort and unjust \nenrichment), the three year limitation  period is provided for by Article 257 : “Gen eral \nlimitation period shall be [established for ] three years” . \n1692.  It was also agreed that  the time from which the period runs is prescribed by Article 26 1.  \nIn light of a short but important point of construction made by Mr Howard in his oral \nclosing submission s, it is convenient to cite three paragraphs of the Article .  In the \ntranslation provide d by Mr Beketov , they are in the follo wing form : \n“1.  The limitation period shall begin to run from  the date on which a person \nbecame, or could have become aware of a violation of his right or the person who \nviolated such right . …. \n3.  The limitation period for claims seeking to apply the consequences of a void \ntransaction shall begin to run from the date on which the performance of such a \ntransaction commenced.  \n4. Where a civil right or interest of a minor is violated, the period of limitation shall \nstart from the date on which such person reaches majority. ” \n1693.  The precise meaning and effect of Article 261  was in dispute .  Although I do not \nconsider that any thing ultimately turns on the different language of the different \ntranslations I should also record that  two slightly different translation s of Article 261 \nwere adopted by Mr Alyoshin  and Mr Nahn ybida: \ni) Mr Alyoshin: “The limitation period shall start running on the date when a \nperson became aware or could have become aware of a violation of their right \nor identity of the person in violation of the right. ” \nii) Mr Nah nybida: “ The limitation period shall apply from the date, when a person \nbecame aware or could have become aware of the violation of its right or about \nthe person who violated the same. ” \n1694.  It was also not in issue that the court has power to disapply the limitation period .  This \npower is given by Article 267(5), which is expressed in very general terms as follows: \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n409 \n “If a court finds any reasons for missing the limitation period to be valid, any violated \nright shall be protected”.   However, the question of what constitutes a valid reason is a \nquestion on which there is some authority and as to the application of which there was \nsignificant disagreement.  \n1695.  There was  a major dispute  on the facts as to when time started to run for limitation \npurposes .  Each of the Defendants submitted that time started to run more than three \nyears before the commencement of these proceedings  on 21 December 2017.  It was \nsaid that t he Bank became, or could have become , aware of a violation of its rights \nbefore 21 December 2014 .  They said that the Bank had the necessary actual or \nconstructive knowledge i n October or early November 2014 at the latest . \n1696.

It is important to record  that Mr Kolomo isky did not plead a case based on constructive \nknowledge, a point on which the Bank relied  in its written closing submissions .  \nAlthough Mr Kolomoisky pleaded that the test to be applied under Article 261 was \nwhen a claimant became , or could have become , aware of the facts on which its cause \nof action depends , the pleaded facts and matters on which he relied were facts and \nmatters of which he said that the Bank was in fact aware before December 2014.   This \ntherefore was a plea of actual not constructive knowledge .  The Bank’s criticism of the \nabsence of any plea of constructive knowledge was given force by the linked point  that \nMr Kolomoisky’s  case on w hich individuals were said to have had the relevant \nattributable actual or construc tive knowledge was never properly pleaded  either .  \nIndeed, even in his opening submissions, the only individuals said to have the requisite \nknowledge were member s of the Manag ement Board  and the ECC, eve n though the \nasserted basis for their knowledge was in some respects  their participation in the \nMisappropriation .  He then went on to contend that t here were many more members of \nthe ECC and the Management Board who knew (or could equally well have found out) \nabout the alleged violation  of the Bank’s rights , but in the event only advance d a \npositive case in relation to one of them: Mr Linskiy.  \n1697.  Nonetheless, th e force of th e Bank’s  criticism of Mr Kolomoisky for failing to plead \nconstructive knowledge was undercut , anyway to some extent , by the fact s (a) that Mr \nBogolyubov did plead a case based on the Bank’s constructive knowledge , (b) that the \nUkrainian law experts addressed constructive knowledge for limitation purposes and \n(c) that questions around the Bank’s constructive knowledge of the violation of its rights \nwere  identified in the List of Issues for the trial .  However, it may be  that the expert \nevidence and the List of Issues were appr oached in the way  they were because of Mr \nBogolyubov’s pleadin g, not because the Bank thought that it would have to respond to \na constructive knowledge case from Mr Kol omoisky . \n1698.  Although constructive knowledge was pleaded by Mr Bogolyubov, he, l ike Mr \nKolomoisky , did not ple ad which  individuals were said to have had the relevant actual \nor constructive knowledge to be attributed to the Bank .  However,  in the opening \nsubmissio ns prepared on his behalf , as well as referring to Mr Linskiy, his counsel  gave \nthe additional examples of Mr Yatsenko, Ms Gurieva , Mr Pikush  and Ms Koryak as \nindividuals through whom the knowledge  of the Bank could be attributed.  \n1699.  Although this is very unsatisfactory,  the argument  now advanced by  Mr Kolomoisky  \nwas only said by Mr Hunter to have given rise to the limited  prejudice  of being  “an \nunwelcome and unfair surprise  as opposed to an egregious, no warning , all hands in \nambush” .  It is unfortunate and unhelpful that the case  was approached in the way that \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n410 \n it was, but i n my view, the allegation of constructive knowledge is one which Mr \nKolomoisky should be permitted to advance as part of his defence .  I agree with the \nsubmission made on his behalf that this case is an example of  what Rimer LJ had in \nmind when he made the following comments  in Lombard North Central Plc  v. \nAutomobile World (UK) Ltd  [2010]  EWCA Civ 20 at [79]:  \n“There will be cases in which it will be obvious that it would be unjust f"}

However, I should stress that my decision to that effect is a finely balanced one , because \nthe lack of particularity as to why and how the individuals through whom the knowledge \nis said by the Defendants to have been acquired by the Bank , and the changes as to who \nthey might be, made it a difficult  case to deal with.  It was only at the end of the trial \nthat a significant number of names were advanced by  Mr Kolomoisky as individuals \nthrough whom the Bank was said to have become aware of the violation of its  rights (a \npoint to which I will revert later).  This has  meant that the criticisms levelled at the \nBank from time to time for its failure to call witnesses  who might have been available \nto it to explain what they knew or could have discovered during the period prior to 21 \nDecember 2014 , have a hollow ring to them . \n1701.  Turning to the substance, t he Bank disagreed  that it became, or could have become, \naware of a violation of its rights well before 21 December 2014.    It submitted that the \ncore question was when it became aware of the facts and matters giving rise to its claims \nand that it should not be attributed with such knowledge until a reasonable period after \nnationalisation.   It said that on any view, knowledge of a violation of its rights should \nnot be attributed to it while the Individual Defendants  were in contro l of the Bank and \nit was unable to take action against them .  Its pleaded case was that it first acquired \nactual knowledge of the misappropriation of funds by the Individual Defendants in the \nmanner alleged in these proceedings between August and December 2017 . \n1702.  The Defendants s ubmitted  that this was wrong because, w hile they accepted the  \ncommon ground between the experts that the knowledge of persons who acted \ndishonestly to the detriment of the Bank was not attributable to the Bank, the knowledge \nof other relevant officers was so attributable regardless of who controlled the Bank and \nregardless of  whether the Bank  was able, as a practical matter, to bring proceedings .  It \nwas submitted that know ledge of facts is quite separate from the ability to bring \nproceeding s.  They  therefore  contended that time runs from the date of knowledge , \nattributed to the Bank as appropriate through the medium of those individuals .  It was \nsubmitted that in the normal case, if there are  reasons as to why  a claimant is unable to \nbring proceedings within the limitation period, it s remedy is to ask the court t o disapply \nthe limitation period , but the Defendants said that, on the facts of the present case, \ndisapplication under Article 267(5) was not available to the Bank . \n1703.  For the majority of the Bank’s claims, it was not in issue that time stopped running on \n21 December 2017, being the date on which these proceedings were commenced.  \nHowever, a point which I will have to resolve  (and to which I will return) is when it \nstopped running for some of the Bank’s claims .

It was said that fo r them time only stopped running on 14 July 2020, being \nthe date on which a protective claim form was issued .  \n1704.  The Bank submitted that , if the limitation period otherwise operated to bar its claims , it \nshould be disapplied pursuant to Article 267(5).  It also mounted an argument that the \nLimitation Defence should not be engaged on the basis that the court should exercise \nits power under Article 16(3) of the Civil Code (“Article 16(3)”) to refuse to recognise \nor uphold a legal right, (that right being  the Limitation Defence ), on the basis  that the \nright is being exercised in an abusive manner or for an abusive purpos e.  It also  relied \non section 2(1) of the Foreign Limitation Periods Act 1984 (the “1984 Act”) and/or \nArticle 26 of Rome II in support of an argument that, if the three year limitation period \nexpired before 19 December 2017, the period should be disapplied.  \n1705.  The Defendants argued to the contrary .  They submitted that, if they were correct on \nthe issue of awareness, there were no grounds for disapplying the limitation period \nbecause there were no valid reasons for the Bank to have waited until December 2017 \nbefore issuing these proceedings in circumstances in which the change of control given \neffect by the Bank’s nationalisation occurred a year earlier.   They submitted that , the \nBank’s witnesses accepted that it was in fact in a position to bring the claim s at any \ntime from January 2017 onwards, and that the Bank  therefore had 9 or 10 months in \nwhich it could have commenced proceedings without difficulty, but failed to do so.  In \nmaking this argument, the  Defendants stress ed that the Ukrainian law experts  identified \nthe key consideration  under Article 267(5) as being “whether there were objective \nreasons beyond a claimant’s control which prevent ed or significantly  hindered the \nclaimant from bringing the action in due time ”; a test  which they said could not possibly \nbe satisfied in the present case , because a  full year expired between the change of \ncontrol on nationalisation  and the commencement of these proceedings . \n1706.  The Defendants ’ arguments on limitation  were expressed relatively shortly in their \nopening submissions .  But they were developed at much greater length in closing , most \nespecially on behalf of  Mr Kolomoisky  whose case on limitation  became more \nobviously a central part of his defence during the course of the trial.  Indeed h alf of Mr \nKolomoisky ’s written closing was directed to his case on why the claims against him \nwere statute barred , as was much of the cross -examination of the Bank’s witnesses and \nmany of Mr Howard’s oral submissions .  The focus was therefore on whether the \nBank ’s claims under Article  1166 were statute barred.  \n1707.  In relation to the Bank’s claim  against the Corporate Defendants  in unjust enrichment, \nthey only raise d a defence of limitation to the extent that  the cause of  action is found to \nbe governed by Ukrainian, and not Cypriot, law.

The reason for this is that the “facts on which [the Bank’s] cause \nof action depends” include that the Relevant Loans and RSAs were vo id and/or entered \ninto abusively, such that the Corporate Defendants  received the Unreturned \nPrepayments without sufficient legal basis .  It was said that t he Bank’s actual \nknowledge of such facts was subject to the same analysis  as the claim under Article \n1166 .  I shall deal with this separately a little later, but it is a submission wit h which I \nagree . \n \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n412 \n The Limitation Defence : Construction of the Civil Code  \n1708.  The experts agreed  that the limitation provisions of the Civil Code should be construed \nin accordance with Article 6(1) of the ECHR , which is part of the substantive law of \nUkraine and  to which the Ukrainian courts make regular reference in that context .  They \naccepted  that this meant that the limitation provisions of the Civil Code should be \napproached flexibly rather than formalistically, and should not be construed in a manner \nwhich would create an unnecessary, disproportionate or arbitrary fetter on the  ability to \nbring a claim.  However Mr Alyoshin in particular  made clear that this approach had to \nbe adopted within the constraints of what he called certain principles, by which he \nincluded the need to avoid legal uncertainty.  \n1709.  The evidence on this point was consistent with the resolution  of the Supreme Court in \nSFG Hermes , which the experts all agreed  reflected Ukrainian law in relation to \nlimitation.  It set out the proper approach to the construction of the limitation provisions \nof the Civil Code and their application in the following passage at [5.85] to [5.91]:  \n“5.85. The case law of the European Court of Human Rights in applying the \nprovisions of Article 6 (1) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights \nand Fundamental Freedoms, which guarantees everyone the right to apply to a \ncourt, emphasises that the right of access to a court  must be effective .  There should \nnot be a t oo formal attitude to the requirements stipulated by law, since access to \njustice should be not only actual but also real … \n5.86. T he limitation period is not an institute of procedural law and cannot be \nrestored  (renewed ) in case of its e xpira tion, but according to the prescription of part \n5 of Article 267 of the Civil Code of Ukraine,  the Claimant has the right to obtain \njudicial protection  if the court recognises valid reasons for the limitation period.  \n5.87. The question of the validity of these reasons,  i.e., the existence of \ncircumstances that, for objective reasons beyond the Claimant ’s control , made it \nimpossible or significantly complicated the timely filing of a claim, is decided by \nthe court in each case, taking into account the available factual data on such \ncircumstances … \n5.88. The law does not provide a list of reasons that may be recognised as valid for \nthe protection of the violated right in the event of a claim being filed after the \nlimitation period has expired.   Therefore this issue falls within the competence of \nthe court hearing the case. At the same time, valid reasons for the expiry of the \nlimitation period are circumstances that make timely filing of a claim impossible \nor difficult.  \n… \n5.90.

Thus, the question of validity of the reasons for expiration of the limitation \nperiod (existen ce of  circumstances that made it impossible or significantly \ncomplicated the timely filing of a claim on objective, independent grounds ) is \ndecided by the commercial court in each particular case, taking into account the \navailable factual data on such circumstances. ” \n1710.  In his closing submissions,  Mr Kolomoisky (and therefore on this point the other \nDefendants) accepted that, anyway as an abstract proposition,  Ukrainian law requires a \ncourt to construe the  limitation provisions of the Civil Code in a manner which is \nconsistent with  the right of access to a court guaranteed by Article 6(1) of the ECHR.  \nThis means that the legislation must be construed and applied in a manner which \nensures an effective opportunity to bring a claim  in order to vindicate a violated right .  \nHowever , it was said that this is irrelevant in the context of th e present  case, because \nthe existe nce of the three year limitation period , combined with the discretion to \ndisapply where ther e are valid reasons to do so , are a more th an sufficient guarantee of \nfairness  for Article 6 purposes.   There was therefore no need for what was said to be a \n“human rights gloss ” to be applied to the proper constructions of Article 261 and Article \n267(5). \n1711.  As will appear, I have concluded that the evidence shows that the position is rather \nmore nuanced tha n that for at least two reasons.  First, a ttribution of knowledge to a \ncorporate entity under Ukrainian law is dependent on the context in which , and the \npurposes for which, the knowledge is sought to be attributed.  In the current context , \nwhere the Bank’s  awareness under Article 261 falls to be determined , one of the central \nissues is whether an individual’s awareness  of a relevant fact or matter can be  attribute d \nto the Bank if the Bank still had no real opportunity to make use of that awareness in \norder  to vindicate its rights through access to the court .  This issue only arises where \nthe clai mant is a non -natural person and does so  quite indep endently of the protections \nprovided by Article 267(5).  \n1712.  Secondly, the question of whether Article 267(5) is engaged , is not driven by the \nquestion of whether it was not actually possible to sue at a particular moment , but rather \nthe key question is whether it is possible to identify  valid reasons beyond the Bank’s  \ncontrol which have prevented or significantly hindered it from bringing the action in \ndue time.   That is a fact sensitive issue which must be approach ed having regard to the \nArticle 6  requirement that the right of access to the court must be effective , and too \nformal istic an attitude to the requirements stipulated by law  must be avoided , “since \naccess to justice should be not only actual but also real ” (per the Supreme Court in SFG \nHermes ). \n1713.  I therefore consider  that the Ukrainian law principles which require the court to apply \nthe legislation in a manner which ensures an effective opportunity to bring a claim in \norder to vindicate a violated right  affects both the question of how t"}

I therefore consider  that the Ukrainian law principles which require the court to apply \nthe legislation in a manner which ensures an effective opportunity to bring a claim in \norder to vindicate a violated right  affects both the question of how the court assesses \nwhether and when the Bank as a corporate body was aware of or could have become \naware of a violation of its rights (Article 261(1)) and the secondary question of whether  \nthe Bank is entitled to protection of its  rights because the reasons for missing the \nlimitation period  are valid  (Article 267(5)).   The impact  of Article 6 is therefore on the \ntrue construction of Article 261 and Article 267(5) taken together . \n1714.  Mr Howard also submitted that there is nothing inherently problematic from an Article \n6 perspective , if the limitation law of a country  means that a claim becomes time barred \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n414 \n without the claimant having a real opportunity to bring a claim. The reason for this is \nthat the law of limitation is striking a balance between the interests of claimants and \ndefendants , in the sense that , if claims cannot be brought , that may be the price of \nachieving certainty .  I accept that submission as a matter of general principle, and agree \nthat an awareness -based limitation provision, combined with a “valid reasons ” \ndiscretion to disapply , ought not to run into Article 6 problems .  However, that will only \nbe the case if the law’s approach to  attribution of awareness (which will normally only \narise in the context of a corporate claimant) and the validity of the Article 267(5) \nreasons  strikes an appropriate balance between achieving certainty and barring a good \nclaim . \n \nLimitation: the requirement for knowledge  \n1715.  Against that background, t he experts  all agreed that Ukrainian law distinguishes \nbetween two kinds of awareness or knowledge: actual knowledge , being what a person \ndirectly knows and constructive knowledge , being what a person objectively should \nhave known . This distinction is reflected in the language of Article 261(1).  \n1716.  Mr Beketov said that there is no hard and fast test under Ukrainian law as to the quality \nof knowledge that a person must hav e. He said that, ultimately, the existence of such \nknowledge will be a question of fact for the court to resolve in view of all the \ncircumstances of the case.  He did not, however, consider that a person who merely \nsuspects the presence of facts or matters s ufficient to satisfy an element of a cause of \naction would be treated as having such knowledge for the purposes of Article 261(1) .  \nThis gave rise to a difference in view between him and Mr Alyoshin , because Mr \nAlyoshin said that what he called a good faith belief as to the existence of the facts \nsufficient to show that  the claimant’s rights have been violated would suffice to start \nlimitation running.  \n1717.  Mr Beketov said that this was not the right test because the  Supreme Court’s resolution \nof 29 September 2021 in case No. 753/2965/20, DGF  v. Drobiazko Anatolii  \n(“Drobiazko Anatolii ”) made clear that the question is whether the claimant has become \n“reliably ” aware of the circumstances of the violation of his rights and interests as a \nresult of the wrongful actions of the defendant, as well as the amount of the harm.  This \ndecision also relates to other aspects of awareness, but for present purposes it is \nsupp ortive of Mr Beketov’s view that mere suspicion of the prese nce of certain facts or \nmatters is not enough.

In so far as good faith belief is belief based on something more \nsolid than speculation, there may be little between the experts on the point, but I also \nagree with Mr Beketov’s opinion that Drobiazko Anatolii  is difficult to square with \ngood faith belief being sufficient  in itself.  As he explained it is “reasonable to assume \nthat the DGF must have had a good faith belief that the rights of the bank (for which it \nwas acting as liquidator) had been violated wh en it made a criminal complaint to the \nauthorities, yet this was found to be insufficient to start limitation running.”  \n1718.  I also agree that Mr Beketov’s opinion is consistent with the resolution  of the Supreme \nCourt dated 27 December 2019 in  case No. 912/3644/17, Agrocomplex LLC  v. \nUstynivka  (“Agrocomplex ”), which characterised the quality of the necessary \nknowledge  as either being (in the case of actual knowledge) a direct awareness of the \nfacts constituting the violation of the claimant’s right s or (in the case of constructive \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n415 \n knowledge) what was called the objective possibility of the person to know about the \nrelevant facts, which should be understood to mean the presumed or contemplated \ninevitability of the claimant acquiring information about such circumstances .   \n1719.  I accept Mr Beketov’s opinion that this goes beyond mere suspicion or unsubst antiated \ngood faith belief.   His written and oral evidence (which I accept) supports a finding that \nthe necessary state of mind is established if the claimant’s awareness of the facts \namounts to a belief derived from sufficient evidence, even though that evidence may \nnot in itself pro ve the claimant’s case at t he trial.  Whether the nature and quality of the \nevidence is sufficient will depend on all the circumstances of the case.  His opinion on \nthis point was one which he himself regarded as consistent with what he understood to \nbe the English Court’s finding in the Tatneft Proceedings as to the equivalent position \nin Russian law: PJSC Tatneft  v. Kolomoisky and Bogolyubov  [2021] EWHC 411 \n(Comm) (“Tatneft ”) at [55] -[56].  The way he put the point in his report (as confirmed \nin his cross -examination ) was: \n“377. … In Tatneft , the High Court concluded (at paragraphs 55 -56 of the \njudgment):  \n“Accordingly, in my view, “knowledge” for this purpose is a belief that a \nviolation of right has occurred which goes beyond mere speculation but \nknowledge is distinct from evidence and a claimant can have knowledge even \nthough it does not have evidence whi ch would prove the case at trial …  \n… as to what amounts to knowledge of violation of its rights ... under Russian \nlaw the claimant has to be able to specify what the act was, what the harm \ninflicted was and the  causal nexus”.  \n378.  Whilst I cannot comment upon the correctness of this conclusion as a matter \nof English or Russian law, it accords with my opinion as to the position under \nUkrainian law. ” \n1720.  The experts  also agreed that , in determining whether a claimant had constructive \nknowledge of facts sufficient to start the limitation period running, Ukrainian law \npresumes that parties to legal relations will exercise prudence and take a reasonable \nlevel of interest in the state of their affairs.   It was submitted on behalf of Mr \nKolomoisky in  closing that the consequence of this principle is that if, using reasonable \nprudence and taking a reasonable level of interest in its affairs, the claimant could have \nbecome aware of t"}

Mr Beket ov agreed with this  proposition in cross -\nexamination . \n1721.  However, basing itself on the resolution  of the Supreme Court in Agrocomplex , the \nBank put a slightly different gloss on the principle .  It submitted that the question is \nwhether (i) the facts giving rise to the claim are so obvious that any reasonable person \nin the claimant’s position would have realised them; or (ii) the claimant was in default \nof a duty of care owed by him in not realising them .  It relied on the following translation \nof a passage from Agrocomplex : \n“The possibility of becoming aware of the violation of a right or of the person who \nhas violated it should in this case be understood as the presumed inevitability of \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n416 \n the person being informed of such circumstances, or of the existence of certain \nobligations of the person, as a measure of due conduct, as a result of the \nperformance of which it would have been possible for it to become aware of the \nwrongdoing in question  and of who committed it. ” \n1722.  Another translation of the same passage was included by Mr Beketov in one of his \nreports in support of his evidence that for constructive knowledge to arise there is a \nrequirement that that the acquisition of knowledge would have been inevitable if the \nclaimant had complied with his obligations or behaved properly:  \n“The possibility of learning about the violation of the right or the person who \nviolated it, in this case should be understood as the contemplated inevitability of \ninforming [i.e., acquiring of information by] the person about such circumstances, \nor the ex istence of certain obligations on the part of that person, as the measure of \nthis person’s proper conduct, as a result of which he would be able to learn about \nthe relevant illegal actions and the perpetrator.”  \n1723.  The concept of “presumed inevitability” and the existence of an obligation to behave in \na particular manner are concepts that are reiterated in a number of other resolution s of \nthe Supreme Court .  Thus in the resolutio n of the Supreme Court dated 3 March 2020 \nin case No. 909/52/19,  Person 1  v. Progress -Bud-IF at [65]  the question was  what \nwould have been learnt  if the claimants “had complied with a n obligation assigned to \nthat person as part of a code of conduct” , and i n its resolution dated 14 August 2018 in \ncase No. 922/1425/17, Eastern Capital Construction Directorate  v. Kharkiv City \nCouncil , the Supreme Court identified the n ature of the duty which the claimant must \nhave had in the following language:  “the existence of certain obligations of the person \nas a measure of proper behavio ur, as a result of which the person would be able to learn \nabout the relevant illegal actions and the person who committed them ”.  \n1724.  Finally in the resolution  of the Supreme Court dated 10  September 20 19 in case No. \n923/875/17 , Person 1 v. Agricultural  Household ‘Skif O’  (“Skif O ”), the following \nlanguage was used : \n“The possibility to learn about the violation of the right or the person who violated \nit in this case should be understood as the foreseeable inevitability of informing the \nperson about such circumstances, or the existence of certain obligations on the part \nof the person as a measure of good behavio ur,"}

In my view, it is clear that speculation, suspicion or good faith belief  if unsubstantiated \nare not of themselves  sufficient  to give rise to actual knowledge . Nor will a  case of \nconstructive knowledge be established , unless it is what Ukrainian law regards as \nforeseeably or presumptively inevitable that the relevant person , acting reasonably and \nin accordance with his obligations, would have been informed of the information of \nwhich he is said to have been constructively aware .  This certainly covers the id ea that \nconstructive awareness  contemplates a duty or obligation to act in a particular manner  \nwhich would as a matter of “presumed inevitability” have led to a particular state of \nawarenes s. \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n417 \n 1726.  I do not think that it means that the facts giving rise to the claim must a t the outset be \nso obvious that any reasonable person in the claimant’s position would have realised \nthem, because constructive knowledge may arise in the absence of actual knowledge \nwhere a duty to act gives rise to a person being put on enquiry .  The question is then \nnot so much about what would have been obvious to a reasonable person ; it is more \nabout how clear it is that the information would have been discovered if the person  had \nacted with what was  described as “proper” or “due” co nduct , having regard to all the \ncircumstances of the case.   In my view  it must be shown that it is inevitable that the \nrequired information in a form sufficient to justify the commencement of legal \nproceedings against the Defendants would have been obtained , if the person concerned  \nhad made the inquiries he should have made,  once he was put on enquiry  by his \nawareness of facts  which “due conduct” required him to investigate.  \n \nArticle 261(1): Of what must the claimant be actually or constructively aware?  \n1727.  In the part of her judgment in Tatneft  I have cited in paragraph 1719  above, Moulder J \nmade  (and Mr Beketov adopted)  a point of significance to another aspect of the \nLimitation Defence .  She said that knowledge was sufficient if  a claimant is able to \narticulate the relevant elements of its  case, by which she meant “what the act was, what \nthe harm inflicted was and the causal nexus”.   In their defences , Mr Kolomoisky and \nthe Corporate Defendants both pleaded that the limitation period commences  on “the \ndate when the claimant  became aware or could have become aware  of the facts on which \nits cause o f action depends ”.  In his closing submissions  Mr Kolomoisky  explained that \nthe obvious rationale for this is that a person who knows the elements of the cause of \naction is, by definition, in a position to file a claim with the court, so as to make it \nappropriate for time to start running.  \n1728.  The Bank took the same view , because i n its Reply  it adopted essentially the same \nlanguage as Mr Kolomoisky and the Corporate Defendants , although it put the point \nthe other way round.  It  plead ed that the limitation period begins on “the date on which \nthe claimant acquires actual or constructive knowledge of the facts on which its cause \nof action depends” , which is justified (as it explained in its closing submissions) on the \nbasis that it is only then that a claim"}

In his Defence, Mr Bogolyubov simply pleaded the wording of Article 261 to the effect \nthat the limitation period commences on a date when a person became aware or could \nhave become aware of the violation of their right or the identity of the person who \nviolated it.  In his written opening, he submitted that the Bank’s claims were prima \nfacie  time barred from the time its rights were violated (i.e., the time of the Relevant \nDrawdowns).  \n1730.  There w ere therefore some differences  in the way in which the parties plead ed the fact s \nand matters of which a claimant must be actually or constructively aware before time \nstarts to  run under Ukrainian law , but the essen tials of their positions were the same.  \nThe same cannot be said about the expert evidence , and a short explanation of what \noccurred is necessary because it is one illustration of why I have felt it necessary to treat \nparts of Mr Alyoshin’s evidence with some c aution . \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n418 \n 1731.  Mr Beketov’s evidence in support of the Bank’s case was t hat a claimant’s knowledge \nmust be of facts and matters sufficient to allow it to file a valid claim . In his view, this \nmeans that, for the purposes of a claim under Article 1166, a claimant had to be aware \nof the four elements of the tort: viz. (a) unlawful conduct by some other person, (b) \nharm suffered by the claimant, (c) a causal connection between u nlawful conduct and \nthe harm and (d) fault.  By this he made clear that he meant actual or constructive \nknowledge of facts or matters sufficient to allow them t o allege the existence of each \nof the elements of the cause of action to which the violation in question gave rise.  This \nwas therefore consistent with the Bank’s pleaded case that the relevant date is the date \non which the claimant acquires actual or cons tructive knowledge of the facts on which \nits cause of action depends.   It was also consistent with the way that Mr Kolomoisky’s \ncase was p ut in closing although , as I shall explai n shortly, Mr Alyoshin  took a different \nview.  \n1732.  In his first trial report Mr Beketov linked the knowledge of the facts and matters of \nwhich the claimant had to be aware with the question of whether the claimant was in a \nposition to invoke the court’s assistance to enforce the relevant right.  As he explained \nin his first trial report : \n“In case No. 321/1702/16 -ts, Ukrainian Railways PJSC  v. Person 1  (“Ukrainian \nRailways ”), the Supreme Court specified in its Resolution of 10 July 2019 that: \n“the commencement of the limitation period coincides with the time when the \nperson becomes entitled to sue and able to enforce his right in court”.  \nAnother  translation of th e passage from Ukrainian Railways cited by Mr Be ketov reads : \n“In other words, the start of the limitation period coincides with the moment when \na person has the right to sue and the opportunity to enforce his/her right through \nthe court. ” \n1733.  In his first trial report, Mr Alyoshin said that the Supreme Court ’s position was \nunequivocal in its interpret ation : \n“The Supreme Court  has interpreted Article 261 (1) of the Civil Code to mean that \nthe start of the limitation period is the time when the opportunity to bring a claim \narises .

{"start": 1578500, "text": "n has the right to sue and the opportunity to enforce his/her right through \nthe court. ” \n1733.  In his first trial report, Mr Alyoshin said that the Supreme Court ’s position was \nunequivocal in its interpret ation : \n“The Supreme Court  has interpreted Article 261 (1) of the Civil Code to mean that \nthe start of the limitation period is the time when the opportunity to bring a claim \narises .  To determine the moment when the limitation period starts running and the \nright of claim arises, it is important to consider both objective (the fact of violation ) \nand subjective (the person became aware or ought to have become aware of the \nviolation ) factors ”. \n1734.  In expressing that view, Mr Alyoshin relied  on the resolution of the Supreme Court in \nAgrocomplex in which the full passage reads as follows:  \n“In accordance with the provisions of Article 261 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, the \nstart of the running of a limitation period coincides with the moment when the right \nto a claim arises with the interested person, meaning the possibility for this person \nto enforce its rights through the court . \nTo determine the moment when the right to a claim arises, objective (the fact of \nviolation of a right) as well as subjective (the person becomes or could have become \naware of this violation) factors are important.”  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n419 \n 1735.  Mr Beketov’s translation  of the same passage  reads as follows : \n“In accordance with the provisions of Art. 261 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, the \nbeginning of the limitation period coincides with the emergence of the interested \nparty's right to sue, ie the ability to enforce their right through the court. To \ndetermine the moment of the occurrence of the right to sue, it is important to have \nboth objective (the very fact of violation of the right) and subjective (the person \nlearned or should have learned abou t this violation) moments. ” \n1736.  In my view both translations convey the critical point as being whether the claimant has \nthe opportunity to proceed on the basis of the information they have or should have \nacquired .  Until the claimant has that opportunity , the limitation period does not start to \nrun.  This is consistent with the agreed position that , in a corporate context such as the \npresent one, the knowledge of  a fraudster or a person who has participated in the fraud , \nwill not be attributed to the defrauded  company  for the purposes of  Article 261.  Their  \nawareness of the facts required to plead a claim  will not cause time to start to run  \nbecause , despite that awareness, the company will have no real opportunity to  vindicate \ntheir rights through access to the court . \n1737.  Despite the fact that he accepted that the start of the limitation period is the time when \nthe opportunity to bring a claim arises , Mr Alyoshin made clear in the experts’ joint \nstatement that in his opinion sufficient awareness  of all elements of a tort  is not required \nfor triggering the limitation period .  He said (and Mr Nahnybida agreed with him ) that \n“the limitation period starts running  when the person became aware or could have \nbecome aware of a  violation of its right or identity of violator. Knowledge of all \nelements of tort is not required for triggering the limitation period ”.  This evidence was \nsurprising because it might be thought that there is no opportunity  for a claimant to \nenforce his rights through the court if he does not have actual or constructive knowledge \nof all of the elements of the cause of action .  If he does not have that knowledge , he \ncannot know (actually or constructively) that his rights have been violated  in such a \nmanner as to enable him to bring a claim . \n1738.

In his supplemental report Mr Beketov dealt with the need for a clai mant to be reliabl y \naware of unlawful conduct causing harm (thereby giving rise to fault) before the \nlimitation period starts to run.   In doing so, h e referred to the resolution of the Supreme \nCourt in Drobiazko Anatolii  in which it was stated that:  \n“Since the objective possibility of a person to know about the circumstances of \nviolation of his rights is needed to determine when the limitation starts running, the \nSupreme Court considers the court’s conclusions that from the date of entry into \nforce of  the criminal verdict of the Kyiv Court of Appeal of 13 March 2017 in case \nNo. 761/30783/13 -k the plaintiff became reliably aware of the circumstances of the \nviolation of his rights and interests as a result of the wrongful actions of \nPERSON_1, as well as the amount of the harm.”  \n1739.  It is difficult to read this case as anything other than support for the proposition that the \namount of the harm suffered and the fact that the harm resulted from the unlawful \nconduct of the defendant (in that case PERSON -1) are facts of which the claimant must \nbecome reliably aware to allow them to allege each of the elements of the cause of \naction to which the violation in questions gives rise.   I agree with Mr Beketov’s opinion \nthat he did not see how a claimant could be said to have knowledge of a tort ious \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n420 \n violation of its right s unless it had knowledge of unlawful conduct causing harm , itself \ngiving rise to a presumption of fault .  \n1740.  When he was cross -examined on this point, Mr Alyoshin’s  evidence was very difficult \nto follow.  In particular he did not accept that a violation of rights without knowledge \nof sufficient pleadable facts to complete a cause of action was insufficient awareness \non the part of a claimant for the limitation period  to start to run.  The way he chose to \nsummarise his position in his oral evidence was as follows:  \n“So I want to confirm my position.  So the fact of the causing of harm under normal \ncircumstances is sufficient to -- not to bring a case but to start a limitation period.  \nThere's two different things.  Please keep -- let's follow that one.  To bring a cla im \nand to start a limitation period is two different things.”  \n1741.  Although, in Mr Kolomoisky’s closing submissions, it was  made clear that he now \naccepted that knowledge of all of the elements was necessary , it is appropriate to record \nthat Mr Alyoshin ’s evidence  on this point was wrong and the approach taken by Mr \nBeketov is to be preferred.   In circumstances in which (a) actual or constructive \nknowledge of violation or violator is required by Article 261 and (b) the Supreme Court \nhas held that the possibility of suing (per Agrocomplex ), or opportunity to enforce the \nright (per Ukrainian Railways ) is a pre -requisite to the commencement of time for \nlimitation purposes, it makes little sense for a limitation period to start before the \nclaimant knew or could have known of each of the elements of the cause of action he \nwould have to plead in order to substantiate his claim.   I find that this is the law of \nUkraine , and that the quality of the knowledge must go beyond suspicion or good faith \nbelief.  \n1742.  There was another associated area in which the experts disagreed.

Mr Beketov  said \nthat it was necessary for the claimant to have been aware of the identity of the tortfeasor , \nor in the case of the unjust enrichment claim, the identity of the person whom Mr \nBeketov called the unjust acquirer.   Mr Alyoshin  took another  view .  It boiled down to \nthe question of whether the word “or” , where it appears in the phrase “aware of a \nviolation of his right or the person who violated such right” (Article 261(1) is set out in \nparagraph s 1692  and 1693  above) is to be read disjunctive ly (as Mr Alyoshin said) or \nconjunctive ly (as Mr Beketov said).   This would be important if a claimant was aware \nof a violation of his rights, but did not know who was responsible for the violation , and \ntherefore against whom he had a claim for their vindication . \n1743.  Mr Kolomoisky said that this dispute did not matter because it has not been suggested \nthat anyone other than the Individual Defendants might have been considered \nresponsible.  I do not think that is a complete answer, because it is clear that there was \nparticipation in what occurred by many individuals and the mere fact that ultimate \nresponsibility is said to be attributable to the Individual Defendants without whose \nparticipation or authority the Misappropriation would not have occurred is no answer \nto the  point.   It is also a point which gave rise to another illuminating aspect of the way \nin which Mr Alyoshin gave his evidence , which it is appropriate for me to record.  \n1744.  In support of his view  as to the nature and significance of the word “or” , Mr Beketov  \nrelied on a resolution  of the Supreme Court dated 26 December 2019 in case No. \n441/755/15 -ts, Person 7  v. Person 4 and Sukhovilsk village council of Horodok  \n(“Horodok ”). This decision  left unchanged  the decision of the Ho rodok District Court \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n421 \n of the Lviv Region in which it rejected a limitation defence expressly on the basis that \ntime was to be calculated from the date when the claimant became aware of both a right \nviolation and the violator’s identity .  The lower court’s decision  on this point , expressly  \nagreed by resoluti on of the Supreme Court , concluded with the following  sentence : \n“… the court concludes that the limitation period should be calculated from the \ndate on which a person became or could have become aware of both the violation \nof his right and the person who violated such right”.  \n1745.  This analysis was said by Mr Beketov to have been support ed by the Supreme Court ’s \nresolution  dated 18 March 2020 in case No. 310/2647/17 -ts, Person 1  v. Person 2 et al.  \nand by  an article (Addressing The Challenges Of Determining When The Limitation Of \nAction Period Starts To Run ), published on 22 March 2018 by a former President of the \nSupreme Court, Yaroslav Romaniuk , where he made the same point as follows : \n“An analysis of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights on the \napplication of Article 6(1) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human \nRights and Fundamental Freedoms in terms of the “right to a trial”, and a systemic \ninterpretation of  Articles 256 and 261 of the Ukrainian Civil Code and Articles 175 \nand 185 of the Ukrainian Code of Civil Procedure, offer a conclusion that the \nlimitation period should be calculated from the date on which a person became or \ncould have become aware of bo th the violation of its right and the person who \nviolated such right.

{"start": 1589000, "text": "  Articles 256 and 261 of the Ukrainian Civil Code and Articles 175 \nand 185 of the Ukrainian Code of Civil Procedure, offer a conclusion that the \nlimitation period should be calculated from the date on which a person became or \ncould have become aware of bo th the violation of its right and the person who \nviolated such right. A claimant may become aware of those things at the same time. \nOtherwise, the limitation period should be calculated from the date on which a \nclaimant became or could have become aware of  the second of them, which is \nusually the violator’s identity. The first thing is always necessary because no \nclaimant will become entitled to sue to protect its right in court without that right \nhaving been violated. A claimant having information regardin g either of those \nthings (being usually aware only of a violation of his right) will not cause the \nlimitation period to run”  \n1746.  Mr Beketov also relied on following  passage from the resoluti on of the Supreme Court \nin Agrocomple x: \n“If it is impossible to determine the day, when the person became aware of the \nviolation of her rights or the violator, or there is evidence available that a person \nwas not aware of the violation, although under the circumstances she should have \nbeen aware of it, the limitation period starts running from the day when the person \nought to have become aware of the violation of her right. ” \nHe said that this was an example of the Supreme Court using the word “or”  in a manner \nwhich demonstrated that it was used in Article 261 in a conjunctive sense because, on \nthe facts it had found that the claimant had knowledge both of the violation and the \nperson who violated the right.  I think that he was right about this.  \n1747.  Mr Alyoshin  and Mr Nahnybida disagreed  with Mr Beketov’s opinion on  the use and  \nmeaning of the word “or” .  They both expressed the view that his  interpretation would \nbe an impermissible contradiction of the statutory language and inconsistent with court \npractice .  They referred to two Supreme Court cases in particular in support of their  \nposition : the resolution  of the Supreme Court in Agrocomplex and the resolution  of the \nSupreme Court dated 20 May 2019 in case No. 183/1474/15, Party 1  v. Party 3 and \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n422 \n Novomoskovsk  State No tary Office  (“Novom oskovsk ”).  However, Mr Beketov pointed \nout (correctly) that these cases did no more than recite the langua ge of Article 261 . \n1748.  They also contended that the resolution  of the Supreme Court in Horodok  relied on by \nMr Beketov was of no value because it did not consider the reasoning of the court \nbelow , even though the decision itself was left unchanged.   They also pointed out that \nthe underlying claim had no merit and therefore the decisions of the lower court meant \nthat what they had to say about limitation was irrelevant.   As to case No. 310/2647/17 -\nts, they said that the Supreme Court simply reiterated the wording of Article 261 an d \nheld that time started running from the time at which the claimant became aware about \nthe person who violated her right , without discussing the question of whether “o r” was \nto be read in a conjunctive or a disjunctive manner.  \n1749.  Mr Alyoshin accepted that the consequence of his construction of Article 261 was that , \nif there was a gap of three years or more between the time a claimant knew  of the \nviolation of its right s and the time it kne w of the identity of the violator , it would never \nbe able to bring a claim within the limitation period .  He said that , in those \ncircumstances , the court would b e able to address the prejudice a claimant might  then \nsuffer  by disapplying the limitation period , and all of the experts agreed  that missing a \nlimitation period for this reason may constitute a valid reason for applying Article \n267(5).

But Mr Alyoshin  did not accept that this was a reason to give a meaning to \nArticle 261(1) which he said contradicted the statutory language .  \n1750.  If matters had rested there, the disagreement between Mr Beketov and Mr Alyoshin \ncould have been characterised as nothing more than a matter on which respectably held \nviews might differ.  In  particular, and despite the oddity of the result, Mr Alyoshin \nwould have been entitled to say that  the use of the word “or” in Article 261(1) reads \nmore naturally in its disjunctive sense.   However, there were two matters on which he \nwas cross -examined which cast his evidence in a very different light.  \n1751.  The first was that Mr Alyoshin  did not refer  in his reports  to two other proceedings in \nwhich he had given evidence of Ukrainian law to an English court  and in which the  \nsame point on the meaning and application of Article 261 had arisen .  The point had \neither been determined or agreed contrary to the view  he now expressed .  In Avonwick \nHoldings Limited  v. Azitio Holdings Limited  [2020] EWHC 1844 (Comm) at [448], \nPicken J had found that the relevant limitation period is three years from when a \nclaimant becomes aware, or should have become aware, of the alleged wrong and the \nidentity of the defendant .  In PJSC Bank Finance and Credit  v. Zhevago  [2021] EWHC \n2522 (Ch)  at [6] , Sir Julian Flaux  C had recorded that the need for actual or constructive \nawareness of both the wrong and the identity of the defe ndant was common ground . \n1752.  When this was initially  put to him in cross -examination , Mr Alyoshin  avoided giving a \ndirect answer to the questions .  But the position became more difficult for him the \nfollowing day when it transpired that , in the Avonwick  case, Mr Alyoshin had adopted \nthe report of his recently deceased former senior partner , who had expressed a view \nwhich justified in terms the finding made by  Picken J , albeit as a reflection of the \npractice of the Ukrainian court’s approach to applying the limitation period, rather than \nthe precise language of Article 261 .  In the end his only answer was tha t that what \noccurred in Avon wick did not reflect his view of Ukrainian jurisprudence an d that was \nwhy he had not referred to it.  This is a very uns atisfactory stance for an expert to have \ntaken.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n423 \n 1753.  The second aspect of the matter on which Mr Alyoshin’s evidence was unsatisfactory \nrelates to a reference  in his fourth report  to an article by a commentator , which dealt \namongst other matters with issues relating to the attribution of constructive knowledge \nto corporate entities ( Petro Guivan, “ Legal regulation of the limitation period: features \nof its calculation and application ”, New Ukrainian Law, Issue 2, 2023 ).  A translation \nof this articl e was also exhibited to his report.   Both Mr Alyoshin’s  citati on from the \narticle for the purposes of considering attribution , and the translation he exhibited \nomitted the following words from the middle of the passage on which he relied , giving \nno indication (whether by el lipsis dots o r otherwise)  that part of the passage was \nmissing : \n“This makes it possible to calculate the statute of limitations from the day when the \nperson learned not only about the fact of the violation of his/her right but also about \nthe identity of the violator, since it is in the presence of these two components t"}
{"start": 1596000, "text": "dering attribution , and the translation he exhibited \nomitted the following words from the middle of the passage on which he relied , giving \nno indication (whether by el lipsis dots o r otherwise)  that part of the passage was \nmissing : \n“This makes it possible to calculate the statute of limitations from the day when the \nperson learned not only about the fact of the violation of his/her right but also about \nthe identity of the violator, since it is in the presence of these two components t hat \na real opportunity to restore the violated right in court opens up .” \n1754.  This made quite clear that it was Guivan’s view that it was necessary for the claimant \nto be aware of both the fact of the violation and the identity of the violator before the \nlimitation period started to run.  When taxed in cross -examination  on the reason for \nwhat appeared to be a highly misleading citation , Mr Alyoshin’s  only explanation was \nthat he thought that before he gave evidence he had provided an alternative corrective \ntranslation of this article which included the missing passage .  There is no corroboration  \nthat th is is what he did, and it still does not explain why the citation in the body of his \nreport did not include it.   He also omitted from his citation of the same article a footnote \nreference to the Romaniuk article I have referred to in paragraph 1745  above .  This had \nthe effect of concealing the fact that both Guivan and R omaniuk took a different view \nfrom him on the point in issue . \n1755.  From the way he gave this evidence , I have been driven to conclude that Mr Alyoshin \nomitted the passage from his fourth report because  he did not want to highlight that an \narticle on which he wanted to rely for one purpose also contained an opinion which was \nflatly contrary to the view he had expressed on another point.  His approach undermined \nmy confidence that I could always proceed on the basis that  his evidence was a \ngenuinely independent expression of his own view , having taken proper account of \nknown  relevant material to the contrary.  \n1756.  In any event, in  my judgment, Mr Beketov is correct on th e point.  It makes logical \nsense and is consistent with both decisions of the Ukrainian Supreme court and \nacademic opinion that, i n order for a limitation period to begin to run,  Ukrainian law \nrequires both the violation of the right and the person who violated the right to be known \n(either actually or constructively) to the putative claimant.  \n \nLimitation: b urden of proof  \n1757.  The experts were agreed that there is a general principle of Ukrainian law that each \nparty norm ally bears the burden of proving the facts and matters upon which they wish \nto rely .  The experts also agreed that the burden of proof is on a claimant who alleges \nthat there are valid reasons why an established limitation period was missed.  However, \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n424 \n the experts disagreed on who bears the burden of proof in relation to a number of other \naspects of a ny limitation defence.  \n1758.  Mr Beketov said that the burden of proving that a claimant had sufficient knowledge \nfor the purposes of Article 261 at a particular date is on the defendants, although \nunsurprisingly he went on to say that, in response to a limitation defence, a claimant \nwill have the opportunity to adduce evidence demonstrating that it did not have, or \ncould not have had, sufficient knowledge within the limitation period.  In his view, this \nis a reflection of the general principle , because the relevant knowledge is a matte r of \nfact upon which the defendants must rely in order to establish that  the claim is statute \nbarred.  \n1759.  Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida disagreed.  They contended that, for limitation \npurposes, the claimant’s knowledge of sufficient facts is presumed, because it will be \npresumed to have been aware of the state of its property "}

Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida disagreed.  They contended that, for limitation \npurposes, the claimant’s knowledge of sufficient facts is presumed, because it will be \npresumed to have been aware of the state of its property rights, with the effect that the \nBank has the burden of proving that it did not have the actual or constructive awareness \nrequired by Article 261(1).  In support of this opinion Mr Alyoshin relied on two cases.  \nThe first of these was the resoluti on of the Supreme Court in Novomoskovsk  in which \nthe claimant brought a claim to invalidate title documents to an apartment more than 13 \nyears after the title documents were issued to the defendant.  Mr Alyoshin said that this \nestablished that the burden of proof to show that the claimant had no act ual or \nconstructive knowledge for the purpose of limitation is on the claimant, who has to \nprovide what the Supreme Court called “appropriate and acceptable evidence refuting \nthe presumption that the claimant could and should have been aware of the state o f his \nproperty rights”.  \n1760.  The second of these was the resolution of the Supreme Court dated 13 May 2019 in \ncase No. 754/13456/16 -ts, Person 1  v. Desnianskyi District State Administration of \nKyiv, in which the claimant brought a claim to invalidate title documents to a house \nalmost twelve years after the title documents were issued.  In this case, very similar \nlanguage was used drawing attention to what the court called “the presumption of the \npossi bility and obligation of the person to know about the state of its property rights”.  \nThe Supreme Court seems to have said that it was not enough for the claimant to show \nwhy the presumption was rebutted by proving why it did not know about the violation \nof its rights, it must also prove that it could not have learned about that violation.  The \ncourt then went on to say that “the respondent, on the contrary, must prove that the \ninformation about the violation could have been obtained earlier”.   \n1761.  Mr Beketov  said that these cases in fact supported his position and pointed to the \nfollowing language contained in the judgment (in a slightly different translation from \nthat relied on by Mr Alyoshin):  \n“The claimant must also prove the fact that he could not find out about the violation \nof his civil rights, which also follows from the general rule established by … the \nCode of Civil Procedure of Ukraine with respect to the obligation to prove by the \nparty  the facts and matters to which it refers as the basis of its claims or objections.  \nDefendant, on the other hand, must prove that information about the violation could \nhave been obtained earlier”.  \n1762.  Mr Beketov said that in the context of constructive knowledge this showed that, while \nthe burden was on a claimant seeking to disapply a limitation period to prove that he \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n425 \n could not have discovered the violation of his rights any earlier, the burden was on a \ndefendant seeking to apply a limitation period to prove that the claimant could have \nobtained sufficient knowledge at an earlier date.  He also relied on two further cas es.  \nThe first was the decision of the Northern Commercial Court of Appeal delivered on \n15 December 2020 in case No. 910/15607/19, Private Enterprise “TRS LEASING”  v. \nJSC Ukrainian Railway , in which the claimant discovered that its rail cars were in the \ndefendant’s possession and sued to recover them in 2019, more than three years after \nits lease had expired.

In rejecting the defendant’s limitation defence, the court said that \nthe defendant had not discharged its burden of proving that the claimant had known \nprior to 2019 that the rail cars were in the defendant’s possession:  \n“The appellant [defendant] did not provide … evidence of awareness of the \nclaimant until 2019 that the disputed property was in the possession of the \ndefendant”  \n1763.  This case is of limited assistance because, as Mr Beketov explained when he originally \nreferred to it, the decision itself was overturned by the Supreme Court on other grounds  \n(resolution  of the Supreme Court dated 20 April 2021, case No. 910/15607/19 ).  \nAlthough it gives some indication of how a Ukrainian court would approach this issue, \nnobody suggested that decisions of the Northern Commercial Court of Appeal are of \nprecedential value.  Even if they were, simply to say that the Supreme Court did not \ngainsay what was said by the Northern Commercial Court of Appeal on the point does \nnot seem to me to be a strong argument.  \n1764.  The second decision relied on by Mr Beketov was Skif O , in which a claim was brought \nin September 2017 challenging a decision taken at a meeting in January 2013.  In that \ncase, the claimant said that he only learned of the relevant decision in July 2016, \nmeaning that his claim was in time.  The defendant raised  a limitation defence, and in \nits resolution  dated 10 September 2019 the Supreme Court made clear that the \ndefendant had failed to discharge its burden of showing that the claimant could have \nhad suff icient knowledge (i.e. constructive knowledge) more than three years before \nfiling the claim.  \n1765.  There are passages in this judgment which are not entirely easy to follow, but I think \nthat the solution is apparent if it is kept well in mind that Article 261 is concerned both \nwith actual and constructive knowledge.  Where the court is concerned with a \ndefendant’s limitation defence in which actual knowledge or awareness is alleged, the \nburden is on the defendants to prove the allegation in accordance with the general rule. \nThis is clear from Skif O  at [4.10] to which Mr Alyoshin had no convincing answer .  \nHowever, where the court is concerned with an allegation of constructive knowledge in \ncircumstances in which proof of actual awareness has failed or is not alleged, the \npresumption based on the obligation of a person to know about the state of his or he r \nproperty rights operates to impose on the claimant a n initial burden of showing that, \ndespite the presumption, he could not have known about the violation on which he \nrelies.  The burden may then move back to the defendant to prove that the information \nabout the violation could have been obtained earlier, although that is in reality the same \nas a shifting of the evidential burden where one party has established their case in the \nabsence of evidence to the contrary from the other.  \n1766.  In the present case the Bank contends that it could not have known of the facts necessary \nto bring its claim until a reasonable time after nationalisation and it relies on the control \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n426 \n which the Individual Defendants exercised over the Bank until that time.

As the Bank is a non -natural person  created by the rules which govern its constitution, \nthe answer to the question of how it became aware of the facts described in Article \n261(1)  depends on the circumstances in which Ukrainian law attributes to a company \nthe knowledge of a natural person associated with that company.  The correct approach \nhas an important impact on the limitation argument in the p resent case .  None of the \nexperts suggested that there is a specific provision in the Civil Code which deals with \nthe attribution of knowledge to a corporate entity, either  generally or for the specific \npurposes of Article 216 .  It f ollows that the court mu st seek to ascertain what the \nSupreme Court in Ukraine would be lik ely to decide if an equivalent issue were to come \nbefore it for determination.  \n1768.  The Bank’s position , substantiated by Mr Beketov’s evidence , is that  the knowledge of \nthose persons with the power or authority  to decide whether the Bank will sue, is the \nprincip al relevant factor when applying a common sense approach to the question of \nwhose knowledge should be attributed to the Bank for limitation purposes.   Given the \nlimitation context in which the issue arises, the guiding principle is that the relevant \nknowledge or awareness must be attributable in such a way that the Bank has a real \nopportunity to bring the claim . \n1769.  The Bank  submitted that the starting point was that the de jure  powers of the Individual \nDefendants as the majority on the Supervisory Board  and the  controlling influence  \nwhich they wielded over the Bank’s affairs at all times prior to its nationalisation, meant \nthat the Bank was unable to sue the Individual Defendants without they themselves \ngiving the necessary authorisations to enable the Bank  to do so.  It followed that their \nknowledge of the ir own  violation of the Bank’s rights was the only knowledge capable \nas a matter of concept of being attributed to the Bank for limitation purposes .  But, as \nit was common ground that the knowledge of a fraudster  will not be attributed to the \nvictim of the fraud, the Bank  was not fixed with what the Individual Defendants  knew  \nuntil after the time of nationalisation , when they were no longer in control  and therefore \nno longer the only persons with the de jure  or de facto  ability  to procure the Bank to \nsue themselves . \n1770.  The Defendants say that is wrong  as a matter of principle , because knowledge is what \nthey called a straightforward question  of fact and is capable of being attributed to the \nBank through individual  employees  other than those  authorised to bring proceedings \non its behalf .  While the Bank’s case is based on the power and authority of an \nindividual whose state of mind is sought to be attributed to a corporate entity  for \nlimitation purposes to procure it to sue , the Defendants ’ case is ultimately based on the \nduty of an individual whose state of mind is sought to be attributed to a corporate entity \nto take s teps to procure it to  do so.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n427 \n 1771.

As I have already explain ed, the experts agree d that there is no Ukrainian legislation \nwhich states general rules as to when the knowledge of one person or entity may be \nattributed to another.   The experts  also agreed on the following points : \ni) a shareholder is not entitled by virtue of that status to manage or act on behalf \nof the company and is not to be equated with the company for the purpose of \nassessing the company’s knowledge;  \nii) once a legal entity has the knowledge to start time running, the limitation period \nis not interrupted if there is a change of management and the new management \nbecome aware of the potential claim only after its appointment; and  \niii) the knowledge of a person who is authorised to act on behalf of a company will \nnot be attributed to it if such person aims to defraud it, or (as it was put in Mr \nKolomoisky ’s closing submissions) has acted dishonestly . \n1772.  Mr Beketov also explained that the principle that a limitation period is not interrupted \nif there is a change of management only applied  where a company knows that it has a \npotential claim before the change.  It does not apply where the former management only \nknows that the company has a potential claim because the former management was \nitself engaged in defrauding the company (i.e. as contemplated by paragraph 1771.iii)  \nabove ).  He said that this was the situation considered in case No. 21/89b/2011 , \nStriletskyi Step Milovskyi zavod rafinovanoyi olii PJSC  v. Belovodskyi Elevator LLC , \nin which the decision of the Donetsk Commercial Court of Appeal to this effect was \nconfirmed by the resolutio n of the  Supreme Court dated 18 June 2018.   I agree with \nthis evidence.  \n1773.  In further development of  the exper ts’ agreement that the knowledge of a person who \naims to defra ud a company will not be attributed to that company, Mr Beketov went on \nto contend that Ukrainian law’s approach was not limited to persons authorised to act \non behalf of a company .  It applied to any attempt to attribute knowledge to a company \nthrough the state of mind  of any person who is aiming to defraud it irrespective of \nwhether or not that person was authorised to act on its behalf.   It was also the Bank’ s \nposition that the knowledge of any person who participated in the fraud is not \nattributable to the defrauded company even though that person may not have had a \nspecific aim to defraud in their own right.   For the most part, this aspect of attribution \nwas not disputed by the Defendants.  The way that their position was described by Mr \nHoward in his closing submissions was that he accepted that knowledge could not be \nattributed to the Bank through an individual, such as Mr Dubilet or Ms Gurieva, who m \nthe Bank  says was implicated in the wrong doing . \n1774.  I agree that this is the correct approach.   I also think that the rationale for this principle \ncasts some light on the correct approach to attribution more general ly; a rationale which \nit is possible to extrapolate from the evidence as a matter of common sense, rather than \nby reference to a specific opinion  expressed by one of the experts.   Consiste ntly with \nthe approach adopted by the Supreme Court  and by  Guivan in the article which was \nmisleadingly presented by Mr Alyoshin  when giving a conjunctive meaning to the word \n“or” in Article 261 , it is simply that there would be no real access to justice if the \nlimitation  period for a fraudulent breach of duty were to commen ce through the \nawareness of  the fraudster  himself.

Both of these aspects of the analysis go to \nawareness for the pu rpose s of the start of the limitation period , and not just the  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n428 \n circumstances in which the limitation period will be disapplied pursuant to  Article \n267(5). \n1775.  Subject to these points and, g iven that  the rules of attribution are undeveloped in \nUkrainian law, Mr Beketov’s view was that identifying the person whose knowledge is \nattributable to a company will alway s be an issue of fact on which a Ukrainian  court \nwill adopt a common sense approach .  On one level , I see the force of that view , but \ncommon sense does not necessarily  identify the  principles which underlie the approach \nthat a Ukrainian court would take.  \n1776.  One aspect of this approach was  Mr Beketov’s consistent evidence  that, as a matter of \ngeneral concept , the court will  place significant weight on the degree to which the \nperson whose knowledge is sought to be attributed to a company was in a position to \nexercise influence over the relevant aspect of a company’s management or business, \nwhether as a result of formal authority or through informal means.   In the case of a \nbank, those persons may well  include managers of the bank, officers of the bank , the \nowner  of a significant participation in the bank, controllers of the bank and UBO s of \nthe bank , but all will depend on the context in which knowledge is sought to be \nattributed .  To that extent, he  said that attribution of knowledge is not  necessarily  \nlimited to persons who form ally hold authority to act on a bank's behalf.  \n1777.  So far as legal proceedings are concerned, and leaving aside the question of the degree \nto which a person whose knowledge is sought to be attributed to a company was in a  \nposition to exercise de facto  influence and control over its management or business, Mr \nBeketov initially said that the knowledge of members of the Bank’s Management Board \nrather than the knowledge of members of its Supervisory Board would be more likely \nto be attributed to the Bank for  limitation  purposes .  The reason for this  conclusion  is \nimportant: based on the documents he had then considered,  he understood that it was \nthe Bank’s Management Board, and not its Supervisory Board, which  had the power to \nauthorise both the instruction of legal advisors and the commencement of legal \nproceedings . \n1778.  I shall come back to the distinction between the Management Board and Sup ervisory \nBoard shortly  but, on the general point, t he Bank’s closing submissions drew the threads \ntogether in this way.  It said that common sense impels a focus on identifying the \npersons who have the power and authority to bring the relevant claim in the name of \nthe Bank.  The reason for this is that the person s so authorised are the persons whose \nknowledge of the relevant facts invests the company with a real opportunity to bring \nthat claim , or as Guivan put it  (see paragraph 1753  above) , a real opportunity  to restore \nthe violated right .  This underlying principle  also points to the knowledge of those \nperson s, who have not just de jure power to decide to bring proceedings, but those who \nhave de facto  power (i.e., the power as a matter of practical reality) as well .  To all \nintents and purposes this will mean anyone who has de facto  control of the entity \nconcerned, which in the case of the Bank was the Individual Defendants .

It may also \nbe said that this wa y of approaching attribution is entirely conventional looked at \nthrough the eyes of  an English lawyer , where many of the recent cases makes clear that \nthe criteria for attribution must be such as will give effect to the purpose and policy of \nthe underlying substantive rule . \n1779.  Initially, and subject to the question  of de facto  control , the position of the Defendants \nwas not so very different.  N ot having identified in their Defences any particular \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n429 \n individuals whose knowledge was to be attributed to the Bank for limitation purposes,  \ntheir case was run on the basis that the relevant persons , who knew or ought to have \nknown the relevant facts , were the members of the management body with the authority \nto bring the claim.   This was made clear during the course of a debate with Mann  J at a \nhearing in June 2020 when disclosure was being discussed and counsel for all of the \nDefendants agreed that the knowledge of the management body with authority to bring \nthe claim was the relevant question for limitation purposes.  \n1780.  Mr Kolomoisky’s case  was then refined by Mr Alyoshin in his first report when his \nevidence was  that, although  he disagreed  with Mr Beketov’s test for attribution of \nknowledge based on common sense on the grounds that it was both unclear and \nunpredictable , the concept of knowledge being attributed through a person being \nauthorised in the relevant context was the correct approach .  In particular Mr Alyoshin  \nsaid that attribution falls to be assessed under Article 92 : \n\"Legal capacity of a legal entity.  \n1. A legal entity acquires and exercises civil rights and obligations through its \norgans which act in accordance with the constitutional documents and the law.  \nThe procedure for the formation of the organs of a legal entity shall be established \nby its constitutional documents and the law.  \n2. In cases provided for by the law, a legal entity may acquire and exercise  civil \nrights and obligations through its participants.\"  \n1781.  He said that it followed from this that , because a company will be deemed to have the \nknowledge of the persons authorised to act on its behalf in the relevant context , \n“knowledge of a person who has no authority to acquire or exercise any rights on behalf \nof the legal entity is not attributable to it , as there is no reason for such attribution” .  It \nfollowed that the main individual whose knowledge is relevant for the purposes of \ndetermining a bank’s knowledge is the chairman of its executive or management board.  \nOther members of management may also be equated with a bank when they carry out \ntheir functions within or on behalf of the bank, on the basis of its constituent documents \nor a power of attorney.   At this stage Mr Alyoshin’s focus was therefore on the power \nand authority of the relevant individuals or relevant body , not on the question of \nwhether an individual had a  duty to convey knowledge he may have received to the \nperson or persons with power or authority to act in the context concerned.   \n1782.  More specifical ly, Mr Alyoshin  was of the opinion that knowledge of members of its \nsupervisory board is not attributable to a bank because they are not responsible for its \nday-to-day management and do not have powers to act on its behalf.   The same principle \napplied in relation to a shareholder and  to persons who indirectly own a beneficial share \nof a company or who can influence or control the"}

The same principle \napplied in relation to a shareholder and  to persons who indirectly own a beneficial share \nof a company or who can influence or control the decision -making of a compan y’s \nmanagers or officials.   In his view the knowledge of such persons cannot be attributed \nto the company .  It was said that such persons are not agents or representatives of the \ncompany and for that reason their knowledge is not attributable to it.  \n1783.  This evidence was then reflected in Mr Alyoshin’s  supplementary report  when h e made \nan explicit link between the source of the knowledge required for the limitation period \nto commence  and the internal body authorised to instruct the initiation of legal \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n430 \n proceedings .  He agreed that this was the Management Board , and explained that the \nreason for this was that this was the body authorised to repre sent the company in the \nrelevant context , viz., the initiation of legal process : \n“the Management Board of the Bank was the sole body authorised to carry out the \nday-to-day management of the Bank and, accordingly, to instruct third party legal \nadvisors and initiate legal proceedings. Therefore, a Ukrainian court would \nconsider the knowle dge of members of the Management Board to be relevant for \npurpose of limitation in respect of the Bank’s claims in these proceedings.”  \n1784.  He was  therefore in agreement with Mr Beketov that the central  question was the \nknowledge and state of awareness of the Management Board , being the body that he \nunderstood to be authorised to initiate legal proceedings .  His principal area of \ndisagreement with Mr Beketov was whether the knowledge of the controlling UBO s \n(i.e., the Individual Defendants) was capable of being attributed to the Bank.  He said \nthat it was not, because they were not authorised to act on the Bank’s behalf or exercise \nlegal right in relations with third parties.  \n1785.  In his supplemental report, Mr Beketov continued to maintain his original  view  on this \npoint .  He did so having considered the views of Mr Alyoshin to the effect that \nUkrainian law adopts a more formalised approach based on attribution of knowledge to \na company only through those authorised to act on behalf of the company in the relevant \ncontext, based on its  articles of incorporation or the law.  Mr Beketov said that this \napproach did not take account of the fact that there are many Ukrainian laws which tr eat \ncontrol of a company as a critical consideration  in a number of different contexts,  and \nwhich define control as the person able to exercise decisive influence on the \nmanagement or business of a legal entity through direct o r indirect ownership (whether \nalone or jointly) of 50% of more of the capital or votes or which exercise such influence \nregardless of formal ownership .  In particular he continued to rely on the fact that  \nArticle 2 of the Law on Banks  defines “controller” and “significant participatio n” in a \nmanner which applied to the Individual Defendants and their interests  (see paragraph \n995 above) . \n1786.  Mr Beketov also  referred to a number of other cases which he said supported his view \nthat knowledge of a bank’s controller or UBO  should be no less attributable to the bank \nbecause that person enjoys informal, rather than formal, methods of influence and \ncontrol.   They were a decision  of the High Commercial Court of Ukraine dated 2 \nSeptember 2014 in case No. 925/1986/13, Kyriachenko  v. Interkos Plus  \n(“Kyriachenko ”); a decision  of the Kyiv Commercial Cour"}

Lin-Teks, No. 3118 - 08. \n1787.  In my view  two of those cases substantiate Mr Beketov’s evidence  as to the fact -specific \nnature of Ukraini an law’s approach to attribution of knowledge in a  corporate context .  \nThus they demonstrate that  knowledge is capable of being attributed to a company \nthrough individuals  with a controlling influence  even though they did not hold formal \npositions of authority within the relevant legal structure:  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n431 \n i) Kyriachenko was concerned with a claim by the liquidator of the vendor of a \nbusiness in circumstances in which the original sale had been invalidated.  The \nultimate purchaser claimed to be a bona fide purchaser of the business without \nknowledge of the invalidity of the original sale agreement.  The court rejected \nthis argument bec ause the state of mind of the intermediate purchaser could be \nattributed to the ultimate purchaser as he was a director of the ultimate \npurchaser, while the state of mind of the vendor could also be attributed to the \nultimate purchaser because its sole sha reholder was his son.  \nii) OrionInvest  was concerned with a claim that a loan agreement was altered by \nthe creditor and the borrower without the awareness or consent of the surety.  \nThe court in fact decided that the scope of the surety’s obligations included \nobligations under additional agree ments to the main loan agreement.  But it went \non to hold that, in circumstances in which the principal debtor and the surety \nwere related parties in the sense that they had the same beneficial owner (or \ncontroller) and the same founder, the sur ety was aware of the conclusion of the \nadditional agreement in any event.  \n1788.  By the time the trial opened, Mr Kolomoisky’s  case as explained in his written opening , \nhad been modified to include the possibility of attribution not just through the  members \nof the Managem ent Board (a position which was supported by both Mr Beketov and \nMr Alyoshin) but also by its other duly authorised representatives including the \nmembers of the Credit Committee who approved the Relevant Loans.   This was the n \nexpanded in oral submission s to include the members of the Bank’s legal department \nwho handled the claims brough t by the Borrowers against the Corporate Defendants  \nand the Ban k.   \n1789.  After the commencement of the trial, t he Bank’s position developed as well , although \nin what seems to me to have been a more consistent manner than that of the Defendants.  \nMr B eketov ’s original evidence to the effect that the knowledge of the Bank’s \nManagement Board was more likely to be considered relevant for limitation purposes \nthan the knowledge of its Supervisory Board was given  on the basis  of the 2017 version \nof the C harter with which he was provided at the time he made his initial report in \nNovember 2021.  After his initial report had been produced, he w as provided with \ncopies of five earlier versions of the C harter dating from various dates between 23 April \n2013 and 10 July 2015.

There were also two further versions of the C harter dating from \nApril 2012 and February 2013 with which he was provided at the time he made his \ninitial report but which he did not then review.  These earlier versions of the C harter \ncontained a clause, not contained in the 2017 version , which gave competence to the \nSupervisory Board and General Meeting to make decisions on holdin g officials of the \nBank’s management bodies (by which was meant, amongst others, members of the \nManagement Board, Supervisory Board and General Meeting) personally liable.  \n1790.  This power was an exclusive power until the General Meeting dated 27 -30 April 2015, \nafter which it was no longer characterised as such, but it remained an express power of \nthe Supervisory Board in the Charter until it was removed in the 2017 version of the \nCharter which post -dated the Bank’s nationalisation.   When it was an exclusive power  \n(and subject only to a very minor change in the language of the translation),  it took the \nfollowing form:  \n“9.3.3. The competence of the Supervisory Board includes  …  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n432 \n (34) taking decisions on holding the officials of the Bank's management bodies \npersonally liable . \nThe powers provided for in paragraphs 1 to 23 and in paragraphs 25 to 46 belong \nto exclusive competence of the Supervisory Board and cannot be decided by the \nBank ’s authorities  other than the Bank’s general meeting.”  \n1791.  Mr Beketov explained that the Bank’s management bodies were defined as  the General \nMeeting, the Supervisory Board and the Management Board, and the ir officials \nincluded members of its Supervisory Board, who at the material time included the \nIndividual Defendants.   In light of this information, Mr Beketov produced a further \nreport  (after the commencement of the trial , but some 2½ months before he was cross -\nexamined ).  In that report, Mr Beketov  reiterated that it is the knowledge of the persons \nauthorised to decide whether the Bank will bring  a claim that is “primarily ” relevant to \nconsider when applying a common sense approach to the issue of attributable \nknowledge  for limitation purposes .  He then explained that, having considered the \nrelevant versions of the C harter, he no lon ger considered that the power to authorise the \ninstruction of third party legal advisors and to commence legal proceedings lay within \nthe operational power of the Management Board insofar as  it reflected  “a decision on \nholding the officials of the Bank’s management bodies personally liable ”.  The \nconsequence of this was  that a Ukrainian court would therefore regard  the knowledge \nof members of the Supervisory Board and the G eneral Meeting , but not members of the \nManagement Board, to be the relevant knowledge f or the purposes of determining when \nthe limitation period started to run in respect of  claims against the Individual \nDefendants  in thes e current proceedings . \n1792.  After seeing Mr Beketov’s analysis of the various versions of the C harter , Mr Alyoshin  \nchanged his position completely .

He said  that “authority to bring \na claim has nothing to do with the start of the limitation period” and that “the knowledge \nof any individual performing his /her duties is pertinent to determining when the \nlimitation period starts to run. ” This was a critical change from Mr Alyoshin’s original \nposit ion, because it introduced the possibility that a defendant might be able to \ndemonstrate that corporate awareness was capable of being acquired through the state \nof mind of individuals other than those with the authority to bring the relevant \nproceedings.  I shall deal separately with Mr Alyoshin’s evidence as to (a) the effect of \nclause 9.3.3 (34), i.e., the significance of a power to sue and (b) the knowledge of \nindividuals performing a duty . \n \nLimitation: attribution of knowledge: the Charter  \n1793.  As to the effect of clause 9.3.3.(34) , Mr Alyoshin contended that the clause  did not \nrelate to the bringing of court proceedings against Supervisory Board members at all, \nbut instead  was concerned with  a specific type of procedure  set out in Art icle 136 of \nthe Labour Code  (“Article 136”) , which permits a company unilaterally to dock an \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n433 \n employee’s wages as a response to (internally -determined) misconduct.   It legislates for  \na deduction regime , which enables an employer to make deductions from an employee ’s \nwages, up to a maximum of their average monthly salary, for damages caused by breach \nof their  duties.   He also said that the reference to “management bodies” in clause \n9.3.3 .(34) did not include the Supervisory Board, but only the Management Board and \nother lower -ranking officials.  \n1794.  I do not accept Mr Alyoshin’s opinion on this point. First, and a s Mr Beketov explained , \nthe argument that the reference to “management bodies” in clause 9.3.3.(34) d oes not \ninclude the Supervisory Board ignores clause 9.1.1 of the Charter , which expressly \ndefines the Bank’s “management bodies” to include the Supervisory Board.   It also \nignores clause 9.1.3 which states that “[o]fficers of the Bank’s management bodies are \ndefined in  accordance with” the JSC Law  in which “officers” are defined (in Art icle \n2(1)(15) ) to include “the chairman and members of the supervisory board”  amongst \nothers.  \n1795.  Secondly, t here is no reference to the Labour Code in the Charter .  This is a surprising \nomission if clause 9.3.3.(34)  were indeed to be referring to the specific type of \nprocedure set out in Article 136 .  If the drafters of the Charter had intended to refer to \nthe Article 136 deduction procedure when including clause 9.3.3 .(34), they would have \nreferred to it more specifically.  \n1796.  Thirdly, a s Mr Alyoshin accepted in cross -examination , and as is appare nt from the \nlanguage of Article 136  itself , larger claims against officials of the Bank are not subject \nto the unilateral deduction procedure .  In such cases, “the employer is required to file a \nclaim with the local general court”.   Based on Mr Beketov’s evidence, t he Bank is \ncorrect to submit that there can be no good reason for reserv ing the relatively \ninconsequential statutory power to deduct a month’s salary to the exclusive competen ce \nof the Supervisory Board, while providing for  the main means of holding an official \nresponsible for a more substantial liability , viz. g"}

Fourthly, I agree that a  more obvious source for  clause 9.3.3 .(34), is Article 41(g) of \nthe Law on Business Companies  (“Article 41(g)”) , which provides that the general \nmeeting of shareholders of legal entities , includ ing joint stock companies such as the \nBank has the power to “adopt[] decisions on bringing officials of company’s \nmanagement bodies to property liability” .   I accept t he Bank’s submission that it was \npuzzling that , having accepted that clause 9.3.3.(34) was like ly to have been taken from \nArticle 41(g), Mr Alyoshin considered Art icle 41(g) to be irrelevant, but nonetheless \ncontended that the provisions of Article 136 were relevant . \n1798.  Mr Beketov was criticised by the Defendants for taking th e position  he did after \nreviewing the various version s of the Charters , but I think that their criticism was \nmisplaced.  In my view, the conclusions which he reached having seen the pre -2017 \nversions of the C harter are entirely consistent with the general position he had \nmaintained throughout.  The form of those versions of the C harter made clear that, \nsubject to the overarching power of the General Meeting (itself controlled by the \nIndividual Defenda nts), the members of the Supervisory Board, of which the Individual \nDefendants were a majority until 30 April 2015, had exclusive  de jure  power  over the \nability of the Bank to hold the officials of the Bank’s management bodies personally \nliable.  I accept Mr Beketov’s evidence that this gave the Individual Defendants, as  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n434 \n controllers of both the Supervisory Board and the General Meeting, legal authority over \nproceedings by the Bank against themselves as a matter of the Bank’s internal \nconstitutional structures.  \n1799.  I also accept that, as a consequence of this, it was their knowledge which was primarily \nrelevant, or what the Bank called “a highly relevant consideration” to any common \nsense approach or inquiry as to as to whose knowledge should be attributed to the Ban k \nfor limitation purposes.  However, I also agree that  Mr Beketov’s evidence confirmed \nthat, as a matter of principle, the knowledge of persons who were authorised to issue \nproceedings is not the only knowledge which might (and I think that the word “might ” \nis important) be attributed to the Bank.  When asked in cross -examination whether it \nwould be wrong to confine the circle of relevant people whose knowledge might be \nattributed to the Bank to persons who were simply those who were so authorised, Mr \nBeketov accepted that “as a matter of principle it would not be advis able”.  \n1800.  In their closing submissions, counsel for Mr Kolomoisky submitted that it followed \nfrom Mr Beketov’s evidence that the disagreement between the experts as to whether \nthe power to bring legal proceedings against the Individual Defendants  was in fact \nreserved to the Supervisory Board under the Charter at the relevant time, or whether it \nrested with the Management  Board was neither determinative of anything nor a “highly \nrelevant consideration”.

This re mained Mr Beketov’s evidence \nthroughout and I agree with it.  \n1801.  In my view, the present proceedings fall within the scope  of clause 9.3.3.(34).  Under \nthe Charter, the only bodies that could authorise the bringing of proceedings against the \nIndividual Defendants were the Supervisory Board or the General Meeting.  Given their \ncontrolling votes as members of the Supervisory Board and shareholders holding in \nexcess of 90% of the Bank’s shares, no resolution authorising the bringing of \nproceedings could have been passed  without their approval.  \n \nLimitation: attribution of knowledge through individuals performing a duty  \n1802.  As to the significance of a duty, even though it would have been relevant to the opinions \nexpressed in his earlier reports, Mr Alyoshin’s reference to the knowledge of \nindividuals performing their duties was new and was not supported by any authority.  \nHe relied on the academic article by Petro Guivan to which I have already referred \n(paragraph 1753  above) in which the author used the following language:  “awareness \nthrough the prism of knowledge of [a legal entity’s] bodies and other persons whose \npowers related to the relevant area of activity”.  As the Bank pointed out, this article \ndoes not suppo rt Mr Alyoshin’s position, because it refers to powers not duties related \nto the relevant area of activity.  Not only does this article not support Mr Alyoshin’s \nnew position, it is also consistent with Mr Beketov’s evidence on the need to focus on \nthose e mpowered to act in the relevant context, which in the present instance is \nlitigation against the Individual Defendants.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n435 \n 1803.  Mr Alyoshin also relied on the resolution of the Supreme Court in SFG Hermes .  He \npointed out that the court in SFG Hermes did not consider it necessary to investigate \nwho on behalf of the company had the necessary knowledge.  He drew the conclusion \nthat “because someone representing the company  knew or should have known about \nthe violation of the company’s rights, the company, therefore, had the necessary \nknowledge for the purposes of limitation.” [emphasis added].  I am satisfied that Mr \nAlyoshin was wrong to say that SFG Her mes gave any support to his position.  As the \nBank submitted, SFG Hermes LLC was a one -man company and  so the “someone” \nreferred to was the one man who acted as its director, a very different situation from the \nposition of the Bank with thousands of employees, a management team and a structure \nof formal decision -making rules.  \n1804.  However, there were some aspects of Mr Alyoshin’s new position which were accepted \nby Mr Beketov in cross -examination.  He agreed that, as a matter of common sense , the \nknowledge of members of a number of the Bank’s internal bodies was also capable of \nbeing  attribut ed to the Bank.  In addition to the Management Board, these included \nmembers of the audit commission , the chief accountant, the head of internal audit , \nmembers of the credit committee and the ECC , heads of departments with duties to \nreport to the  Management Board and members of the legal department.

He went on to  accept that t heir knowledge may \nfall to be attributed to the Ba nk, but he did not say that it would  whether by reason of \ntheir status or otherwise, nor did he say that the existence of a duty to conve y \ninformation to a person empowered to act in the relevant context was in  any sense the \ntest for determini ng whether  knowledge is to be attributed to the company to which the \nduty was owed.  \n1805.  This might be thought to have been  consistent with what had become Mr Alyoshin’s \nfocus on duties rather than powers  when he said  that: \n“the issue that matters is when an individual within the entity (official or employee) \nwho is allocated or delegated with the relevant duties or powers within the company \nacquired knowledge about violation of the company’s right (actual or constructive), \nwhich is relevant to exercising such individual’s duties and/or powers.”  \n1806.  However, i n my judgment the submission made by the Defendants that the knowledge \nof any employee will always be attributed to the Bank if they acquired that knowledge \nin the performance of their duties, or if it is relevant to the performance of their duties, \nis not justified by the expert  evidence  and is wrong as a matter of Ukrainian law.  On \nanalysis , Mr Beketov’s  evidence , which I accept,  was that individuals within identified \ncategories were capable of being the conduit through which knowledge was to be  \nattributed to the Bank , but that the answer  would always depend on  the context in which \nknowledge is said to be attributable on the facts .  All that Mr Beketov ultimately \nconfirmed was that  they fell into a category of persons whose knowledge was capable \nof being attributable to the Bank , but only if in the relevant context “as a matter of \ncommon sense” and having regard to “all the factual circumstances of the case ” \nattribution of knowledge to the company can occur through them;  it went no further \nthan that .   \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n436 \n 1807.  I also think  there is force in  the Bank’s submission that the reason Mr Beketov \nexpressed himself in the way that he did (well illustrated by his constant use of the word \n“potentially” in his answers) was because he considers that Ukrainian law attributes \nknowledge to a corporate body in a flexible manner .  I accept Mr Beketov’s evidence  \nthat Ukrainian law impels a focus on the relevant context , which in the present case is \nthe commencement of legal process  against the entity’s own controlling shareholders \nand those associated with them .  \n1808.  The first conclusion which the Bank submi tted the court should  draw from Mr \nBeketov’s evidence was that , while the knowledge of the Individual Defendants , as the \nowners and controllers of the Bank and the holders of executive positions within it,  was \nprima facie  attributable to it, that could not be the case prior to nationalisation in \nDecember 2016 , because they themselves were the persons who aimed to (and did ) \ncommit the fraud .  The Bank also submitted that the same could be said of the members \nof the Ma nagement Board who were involved in the Misappropriation, naming in \nparticular Mr Dubilet, Ms Gurieva and Mr Novikov .

The short submission was that it \nis wholly implausible to suppose that they could have possessed knowledge of the \nrelevant facts  in a manner sufficient to start time running, but not also have been party \nto the fraud.  \n1809.  The next submission is that while it was understandably accepted by Mr Beketov that \nthe knowledge of a person with a duty to draw the attention of those with power and \nauthority to commence the relevant proceedings  in vindication of the violated right is \ncapable of being attributed to the Bank, that may not be the case if it is established on \nthe facts that the only persons  who had that power or authority  (whether de jure  or de \nfacto ) will not, on receipt of that information, exercise that power, whether to sue \nthemselves or to sue some other person.   This would reflect  Mr Beketov’s evidence  that \nthe guiding principle is  for the court to identify  the context in which the knowledge is \nsought to be attributed and then apply common sense and consider all the surrounding  \ncircumstances to determine whether , on the facts , the knowledge of a particular \nindividual is or is not attributable to the company concerned .  In the present case, the \nrelevant context is  whether  (and when ) the knowledge sought to be attributed to the \nBank is attributable for the purpose of bringing proceedings against its controlling \nshareholders . \n1810.  Mr Beketov’s focus on context was developed by the Bank to include  the question of \nwhether , in the light of wrongdoer control , the Bank had a real opportunity to bring the \nproceedings .  This was  attacked by Mr Howard on the basis that real opportunity to sue \nwas irrelevant to the inquiry .  Its relevance only arose later when the court was \nconsidering Article 267(5) ; knowledge for the purposes of Article 261 is a \nstraightforward question of construction of the Article.  He said that r eal opportunity to \nbring a claim is not part of the test  and finds no direct suppor t in the authorities;  apart \nfrom anything else he said that there was no such concept included in the statuto ry \nlanguage.  He said that in the context of a corporate body, once you have identified the \nrelevant people, there is simply a binary factual question – either they have the relevant \nawareness or they do not.  \n1811.  Mr Howard also submitted that a real opportunity test was inherently uncertain.  I am \nnot sure that this is a particularly persuasive point , because it seems to me that, while \nthere will be uncertainty in some cases, it is no more uncertain than the issue of how \nawareness is to be attributed to a putative corporate claimant in any event.  Indeed the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n437 \n identification both of the relevant people through whom the awareness of the company \nis to be attributed and their own state of knowledge may itself a be a complex exercise.  \n1812.  Mr Howard  illustrated his argument  by reference to Article s 261(3) and 261(4) , one \ndealing with the consequences of a void transaction and the other with what happens \nwhen the civil right or interests of a minor is violated  (for the text see paragraph 1692  \nabove).   It was said that n either of these two limitation periods are tied to the question \nof when the putative claimant had a real opportunity to bring a claim .

In any event , my attention \nwas not drawn to anything sa id by the experts which supported the argum ent, but I do \naccept that it is at least one indication that real opportunity to sue is not the driving \nconsideration in all cases.  \n1813.  Mr Howard  also point ed to what  happened in SFG Hermes . He said that what  was \nsignificant about this decision  was that the courts in Ukraine , at all levels , agreed that, \nfor the purposes of the claims by Hermes  against its former sole shareholder and \ndirector  arising out of transactions which took place when he was in control , time \nstarted to run at the stage when he was in control  even though , as the controller, he was \nobviously  not going to bring proceedings against himself .  The case was then decided \nin the claimant’s favour by application of Article 267(5), not on the basis that the \ndirector’s awareness was not attributable to the company in the  first place.  This is \ndifficult to reconcile with any principle that knowledge will no t be attributed through \nan individual where any dissemination of the knowledge of which that individual is \naware would be a futile exercise for the purpose of commencing legal proceedings , \nbecause the corporate entity is controlled by the wrongdoer who is the putative \ndefendant . \n1814.  SFG Hermes  was not put to Mr Beketov  in cross -examination , and it  is difficult to \nunravel whether there was any significance in the fact  that there appeared to be two \nenterprises involved in what occurred: Hermes Farming LLC and SFG Hermes LLC .   \nIt is also not entirely clear to me why the principle agreed in the current case that the \nknowledge of a fraudster will not be attributed to the victim of the fraud  did not \ndetermine the issue.  \n1815.  Nonetheless , I agree that it is a decision of the Supreme Court  which recited that the \nlower courts had determined that Hermes became aware of the transfer of the funds \nsought  to be recovered at the time of the relevant transaction , and went on to say that it \nwas therefore correctly concluded that this was the moment when the company could \nassess the amount of damage corresponding to the amount of the transferred funds with \nthe consequence that the limitation period started to run .  This is clear authority for the \nproposition that the company acquired knowledge for limitation purposes, even though \nits sole director and shareholder at the time was the defendant who was hardly likely to \nauthorise the bringing of proceedings against himself .  It is inconsistent with corporate \nawareness being affected by the question of whether the company had any opportunity \nto sue once the relevant knowledge came into the hands of an individual whose state of \nmind might normally be attributed to the company.   \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n438 \n 1816.

Some of the argument in closing on this issue went beyond the expert evidence, but the \nreal challenge to Mr Howard’s approach is that it did not pay sufficient regard to the \nfact that Article 261 is dealing with awareness for limitation purposes not just w here \nthe claimant is a non -natural person, but also where he is a natural person.  How \nawareness is to be attributed to a non -natural person raises very d ifferent question s, \nwhich are ultimately corporate law issue s.  That is where, on the expert evidence,  the \nquestion of context comes in , i.e., what is the purpose for  which attribution is said to be \nnecessary and why ?  This  is not so very different from recognised principles of English \nlaw: see e.g. the decision of the UK Supreme Court in Singularis Holdings Ltd v. Daiwa \nCapital Markets Europe Limited  [2019] UKSC 50, [2020] AC 1189 at [34] , where the \ncontext and purpose for which the attribution is relevant was said by Baroness Hale \nPSC to be at the core of the analysis.  \n1818.  I agree that the relevant context is the commencement of legal process  against the \nBank’s controlling shareholders and their associates , and the power, de jure  or de facto , \nto bring the relevant claim on behalf of the Bank.  I was not shown any authority which \nestablishes that knowledge in this context always includes the knowledge of someone \nwho is under a duty to convey information to another person who has that power to act, \nlet alone to any other employees.  However, consistently with the agreed require ments \nof Ukrainian law to have regard to Article 6(1) of the ECHR where the attribution of \nawareness is an issue that arises in a limitation context, it was Mr Beketov’s evidence \nthat it may do, but a duty to act is just one of the factors which goes into the mix when \ndetermining whether as a matter of common sense the company is to be attributed with \nthe knowledge of a particular person.  \n1819.  The critical question from the Bank’s perspective  is whether it had a real opportunity \nto bring the claim said by the Defendant s to be barred by the statute .  Mr Howard \nsubmitted that to ask such a question , based as it is on the suggestion that where a \ncompany is controlled by the person who is the defendant in the claim , the real \nopportunity test is not satisfied because attributing the knowledge won't lead to the \ncompany having a real opportunity , is to apply a rule of disattribution,  rather than a rule \nof attribution and is in fact what he called “totally bogus ”.  In other words , he submitted \nthat knowledge of facts is quite separate from the ability to bring proceedings.  \n1820.  I do not agree with that submission  in the form in which it was put , not least because it \nseems to me to be founded on t oo hard-edged a rule of when know ledge is to be \nattributed to a corporate entity .  It is not disattribution; it is simply a recognition that \nbecause the Bank is a non -natural person , with many stakeholders (such as depositors \nand other creditors interested in its assets) and always subject to the possibility that its \ncontrollers may change,  its state of mind is capable of being determined differentially \ndepending on the context."}

Indeed t he importance of the claimant’s opportunity to bring  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n439 \n the claim was accepted in this very context by Mr Al yoshin in his first repor t (see the \npassage cited for other reasons  in paragraph 1733  above ). \n1821.  It was also established as a statement of principle articulated by the Supreme Court in \nAgrocomplex , in which Mr Alyoshin’s translation made clear that the start of the \nrunning of a limitation period coincides with the moment when the right to a claim \narises “meaning the possibility for this person to enforce its rights through the court ”.  \nIf there is no possibility to enforce rights through the courts, because the only \nindividuals  with power (de facto  or de jure ) to sue are themselves implicated in the \nfraudulent activity  in respect of which a claim might be made , knowledge will not \nnormally be attributed to the Bank for the purpose  of determining whethe r or not the \nBank’s claim in respect of that activity is barred by the limitation period.   The reason \nfor this is that in that context  it cannot be said that the Bank  is in a position in which it \ncan properly be said that there is any possibility for the Bank to enforce its rights \nthrough the court .  This is a perfectly logical approach for any legal system to take , \ngiven that the whole purpose of a requirement that the claimant is aware of  a violation \nof its rights  before time starts to run is because it is only then that th e claimant is , as a \nmatter of practice , in a position to sue.  \n1822.  I also accept the Bank’s submission that there will be case s in which the Defendants’ \nsubmission  is difficult to reconcile with the approach taken more generally by \nUkrainian law on the proper application of the ECHR  to the construction of Article 261 \n(SFG Hermes as cited in paragraph 1709  above) .  In that context , Mr Hunter submitted \nthat the evidence showed that Ukrainian law answ ers the question of whether \nknowledge is attributable to a company through an individual by reference to the \nguiding principle that the law of limitation must not undermine real access to justice.  \nIt was said that in the same way that this leads to the exclusion of a fraudster’s \nknowledge, so too it must guide  the question of whether the knowledge of others counts , \nwhere, notwithstanding their knowledge, the company has no real access to justice \nbecause it has no real opportunity to bring the claim.  \n1823.  In my view, the ultimate answer to the question of when awareness of a claim is capable \nof being attributed to a company notwithstanding wrongdoer control is nuanced.  I agree \nthat, even where the evidence supports a finding that the defendant wrongdoer was in \ncontrol and will not permit the action to proceed, there are circumstances in which \nknowledge will still be attributed to the company for limitation purposes .  Thus it may \nbe the case that , even if a senior employee has no power to procure suit, there  may be \nother ways in which he can influence the taking of steps to enable the company to \nvindicate the violation of its rights, which it might be appropriate to take into account \nas part of the relevant context .

For the reasons I have endeavoured to explain, I agree that in general term s the Bank’s  \nargument  has real substance , and is consistent with the apparent policy behind a \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n440 \n knowledge -based limitation system in the first place.  B ut the Defendants submit ted \nthat the way that Ukraini an law recognises  the guiding principle is through the general \ndisapplication of the limitation rule  in accordance with Article 267(5) , rather than at the \nanterior stage of determining  whether awareness or knowledge should be attributed to \nthe claimant company in the first place .  I agree that this is a perfectly coherent concept, \nand so long as the disapplication provisions are construed in an appro priate manner, is \ncapable of providing a just answer where litigation is not in fact available to a putative \ncorporate claimant because of wrongdoer control .  It also avoids that difficulty that the \nconsequence of the Bank’s submission is that where wrongdoer control prevents a \ncorporation from suing for a lengthy period, it will always be the case that the limitation \nperiod will not start to run in any such cases until a change of control occurs.  Mr Hunter \ndid not shrink from accepting that as the consequ ence, but I think  it would be a \nsurprising result and is difficult to reconcile with  the principle that an important factor \nin any limitation context is legal certainty.  \n1825.  The Defendants also  drew attention t o the fact that th eir submission  was consistent with \nthe approach adopted  in Sirius -Bud and SFG Hermes , a point to which I have already \nalluded  above.  Mr Hunter accepted that this was the case and also accepted that there \nwas no decision of the Supreme Court which applied the real opportunity or the real \naccess test at the attribution stage, but he submitted (correctly) that the point was not \nargued in that way in Sirius -Bud or in SFG Hermes . He said that, if the matter were to \ncome before the Grand Chamber, it would confirm that the limitation period cannot \ncommence until an individual with the legal and practical ability to comme nce the claim \nknew of the relevant facts, not someone who was a party to the fraud or who would be \nprevented from proceeding with the claim by the fraudsters.  \n1826.  While Mr Hunter may be correct  to say that the point was not argued  in that way , it is \nstriking that, if it were to be correct  that there was in fact a n anterior  reason for rejecting \nthe defendant’s limitation defence, i.e., that his state of mind was not attributable to the \nclaimant in the first place , nobody sought to do so .  Both cases are  also a clear reflection \nof the way in which Ukrainian courts approach these types of problem.  The question \nof awareness is dealt with by asking whether the relevant i ndividual is sufficiently \nsenior and either has the authority to act or an obligation to convey the relevant \nknowledge to those with the authority to act, irrespective of whether or not the power \nwill then be exercised.   \n1827.

In reaching my c onclusion  on this point , I agree with the Bank that the Supreme Court \nin SFG Hermes  does not accept the way in which  the interrelationship between Article \n261(1) and Article 267(5) was put in Mr Kolomoisky’s closing submissions .  It was \nsaid that there is no need to distort the plain meaning of Article 261(1), because the \nCivil Code provides a “safety valve” in Article 267(5) for claimants who miss the \nlimitation period for valid reasons , and then went on to submit : \n“Where a claimant claims to have been unable practically to bring its claim in time, \nwhether because it was under the control of a wrongdoer or for other reasons, such \narguments can be taken into account in the exercise of the court’s discretion under \nArticle 267(5)”.  \n1828.  The evidence of Ukrainian law does not support a conclusion that the plain meaning of \nArticle 261( 1) would be distorted  as suggested .  Because  the awareness is that of a \ncorporate entity, that is to beg the  very question  as to whose awareness is to be attributed \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n441 \n to the Bank  in the first place.  But much depends on whether  Article 267(5) will always \ngive the necessary protection to fulfil the policy reflected in a number of  Supreme Court \ndecisions , all of which concentrate on the start of the limitation period coinciding with \nthe moment which is variously described as the moment when a person has the \npossibility  to enforce his right through the court  (Agrocomplex ), the right to sue and the \nopportunity to enforce that right through the court ( Ukrainian Railways ) and  when he  \nis reliably aware of the violation (Drobiazko Anatolii ). \n1829.  In particular I do not accept that the evidence shows that  this policy is necessarily \nsatisfied when, as a matter of principle rather than practicality, a claimant has an \nopportunity to file a claim or that any other approach would lead to great uncertainty .  \nThat is not the way that the Ukra inian decision s describe  the underlying policy .  A \nsystem based on actual or constructive awareness inevitably carries with it a level of \nuncertainty  both as to the start of the limitation period itself and as to the question of \nwhether or not it should be disapplied.  \n1830.  Quite apart from the way in which the principle is expressed in the authorities  and \nexplained by Mr Beketov, it is self -evident that  Article 267(5) does not deal only with \nthe situation in which a corporate entity seeks to sue its former controllers .  As I shall \nexplain shortly , it is a general provision which is engaged in many different contexts .  \nIt is therefore doing a different job from the legal principles appl icable to the rules \nattribut ing knowledge to a corporate entity .  It applies in any situatio n in which the \nclaimants would otherwise miss the limitation period for valid reasons , and in that sense \nis capable of being quite broad in its impact.  But , if the Defendants are correct i n their \napproach  to attribution of knowledge or awareness , Article 267(5)  also gives a narrower \nprotection  to a corporate entity in the position of the Bank , and potentially only a very \nshort time to sue its fraudulent former controllers  from the time at which it acquired the \nreal opportunity to do so.  \n1831.  This is most clearly illustrated by those parts of  the expert  evidence  which support Mr \nKolomoisky’s closing submission that the fact that a claimant does not have the full \nlimitation period to investigate its claim or bring proceedings does not in itself imply \nthat it had valid re"}

This is most clearly illustrated by those parts of  the expert  evidence  which support Mr \nKolomoisky’s closing submission that the fact that a claimant does not have the full \nlimitation period to investigate its claim or bring proceedings does not in itself imply \nthat it had valid reasons for failing to file a claim in time .  In other words , Article 267(5) \nonly protects a claimant defrauded by its former controllers if it moves quickly  to file \nits claim  when that control comes to an end .  There is a much greater l evel of protection \nfor the defrauded claimant if the limitation period has not started to run in the first place , \nbecause no knowledge or awareness can be attributed to it until the transfer of control \ncan take effect.  \n1832.  It follows that if the Defendants are right , Article 267(5) can properly be described as \na less satisfactory substitute for the protection granted to a defrauded entity by Mr \nBeketov’s approach to attribution of knowledge for limitation purposes.  That is \nobviously capable of being a policy choice made by Ukrainian law, but i n light of the \ncommon ground that  the knowledge of the fraudsters cannot be attributed to a defrauded \ncompany, i t is difficult to think of any sensible reason why  the new controllers should \nbe placed under a significantly  more restrictive limitation regime .  This is particularly \nthe case as the evidence indicates that the underlying policy focuses on the importance \nof awareness as the trigger for time starting to run, a trigger which itself is driven by \nthe claimant being in a position to take ste ps to vindicate its rights .  Given the context , \nand given the fact sensitive  approach to attribution of knowledge  which I am satisfied \nrepresents the law of Ukraine, I have concluded  that the right approach to attribution of \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n442 \n knowledge for limitation purposes , substantiated as it is by a proper understanding of \nthe evidence given Mr Beketov , is that the law of Ukraine will not normally attribute \nto a corporate entity, the actual or constructive awareness of a violation of its rights for \nlimitation purposes, if that corporate entity does not have the ability to commence or \ninfluence the commenceme nt of proceedings against the wrongdoers responsible for \nthe violation.  This is more especially the case where the reason for the inab ility is both \nthat the wrongdoers have the only de jure  power to commence legal process and are in \nde facto control of the Bank such that there is no prospect of the Bank being able to \nvindicate its rights through suing them.  \n \nArticle 267(5): disapplying the limitation period  \n1833.  The parties’ experts agreed that the burden is on the claimant to establish valid reasons \nto disapply a limitation period  in accordance with the provisions of Article 267(5).  \nThey also agreed that the grounds on which the limitation period might be disapplied \nare heavily fact dependent and that, in assessing those grounds, the key consideration \nis whether there are “objective reasons beyond the claimant's control that prevented or \nsignificantly hindered the claimant from bringing the action in due time ”.  They also \nagreed that , in appropriate circumstances , a claimant ’s lack of knowledge (either actual \nor constructive ) as to the identity of the person who violated its rights may constitute a \nvalid reason for disapplying the limitation period in accordance with A rticle 267 (5). \n1834.

However it is important to stress that the experts were careful not to say in their joint \nstatement that the key consideration I have just described was a proxy for the statutory \ntest.  It remains the key consideration but it is by no means determinative.  There were \noccasions on which the Defendants’ submissions appeared to be based on the \nproposition that it was.  I do not agree that any such construction of what the  experts  \nsaid would reflect Ukrainian law and o ther parts of their  joint statement (partic ularly \nrelating to the discretionary nature of the court’s power to disapply and the fact \nsensitivity of what occurred ) make plain that it is not.   The same can be said about \ndecisions of the Supreme Court such as Sirius -Bud and SFG Hermes  both of which are \ninconsistent with an inflexible application of the language of Article 267(5) itself with \nits reference to “valid reasons”.  \n1835.  So far as this agreement between the experts was concerned, it amounted to a \nmoderation of Mr Alyoshin’s initial view that “compelling” rather than “valid” reason \nwas required before the court could exercise its discretion under Article 267(5) or that \nthe objective reasons required made the filing of a claim either “impossible or \nsubstantially burdensome”.  The difference in language reflected discrepancies in the \ntranslation of both Article 267(5) and a decision of the High Commercial Court of \nUkraine date d 29 May 2013 which the experts seemed to have resolved in the course \nof preparing their joint statement.  Mr Beketov explained that the High Commercial \nCourt has now been abolished but its guidance is still relied on today unless in conflict \nwith the prac tice of the Supreme Court.  In that decision, the High Commercial Court \nalso made clear that the objective reasons referred to by the parties’ experts must be \ndecided by the court in each specific case taking into account the available factual data \non such  circumstances.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n443 \n 1836.  There was disagreement between the experts as to whether, as Mr Beketov considered \nto be the case, the need for objective reasons beyond the claimant’s control means that \nthe court will assess the sufficiency of the claimant’s asserted reasons for failing to \nbring a claim within the limitation period on an objective basis, applying a standard of \nreasonableness.  Mr Alyoshin said he knew of no cases in which the court had applied \na standard of reasonableness when assessing the validity of an objective reason  \nadvanced by the claimant for not applying the limitation period.  He said that objectivity \nwas not about reasonableness but was about being independent from the claimant’s own \nactions and being beyond its control.  \n1837.  Mr Beketov also said in his initial report that these objective reasons were capable of \nincluding the Individual Defendants ’ control of the Bank prior to nationalisation and \nthe systematic concealment of the Misappropriation during that  period.  He said that , if \nit were established that those matters  prevented or significantly hindered the Bank from \nbringing its claim within three years of the Misappropriation , Article 267 (5) could \nappropriately be applied .  Mr Alyoshin did not wholly disagree with this evi dence, but \nhe said that “control” and “systematic concealment” were both concepts that were too \nvague to allow him to agree or disagree with Mr Beketov’s view.  \n1838.

This evidence was adopted by the Bank in its opening submissions , in which it  relied \non three objective reasons beyond its control which prevented or significantly hindered \nit from pursuing its claim . The first was that , prior to its nationalisation , it was under \nthe ownership and control of the Individual Defendants.   The second was that , \nthroughout this  period,  other senior managers within the Bank were loyal to the \nIndividual Defendants and involved in implementing the misappropriation .  The third \nwas th at the notion that the Bank would ever have been permitted to investigate or \npursue claims against any of the Defendants may be swiftly dismissed . \n1839.  Mr Alyoshin  disagreed, asserting that he did not consider that the Individual \nDefendants ’ control of the Bank in the period prior to its nationalisation would be \nrecognised as a sufficiently “c ompelling ” reason (the language he then considered \napplied) to engage Article 267(5).  In his opinion other officials and organs of the Bank \nstill had the ability to bring claims in time, and, because they had fiduciary duties to act \nin the Bank’s best interests independent ly of the Individual Defendants’ control, the y \nwere obliged to submit the claim once the grounds were established and they were \npractically able to do so.  However, he did accept that, if the influence exerted by the \nIndividual Defendants in practice prevented the Bank’s officials responsible for \npreparing or filing lawsuits from doing so, then, in theory, that could provide a ground \nfor disapplying the limitation.  \n1840.  It was clear from the evidence  of both Mr Alyoshin and Mr Beketov , and from an \nanalysis of the decisions of the Supreme  Court which were addressed in their evidence, \nthat the question of whether the reasons for missing the limitation period were valid is \nin the ultimate analysis highly fact specific.  I also consider it  clear that Ukrainian law \nrequire s the court to avoid extreme formalism (per SFG Hermes ) and to that extent  \nhard-edged rules will be  disapplied where the circumst ances of an individual case \njustify that approach .  But I also accept Mr Howard’s submission in cl osing that , in the \npassage  from  the judgment in Esim v . Tukey  (App No 59601/09 at [21]) relied on by \nthe Supreme Court in SFG Hermes , the ECtHR went on  to state that the court must  also \navoid excessive flexibility such as would render nugatory the procedural requirements \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n444 \n laid down in statutes.   The court is also required to  apply the general principles of \njustness, good faith and reasonableness discussed at some length in Sirius -Bud. \n1841.  Those cases included : \ni) the Supreme Court’s resolution dated 18 January 2021 in case No. \n29/5005/6325/2011, Tamira LLC , where the following was said:  \n“The panel of judges also agrees with the statement of the commercial court \nof appeal that the law does not specify the list of reasons that may be found \nto be valid for the protection of a violated right if a claim is filed after the \nlimitation period has  expired.

Person 1 , where the following passages give a go od \nflavour of the right approach : \n“The conclusion on the validity of reasons for filing a lawsuit after expiry of \nthe limitation period can be reached only after examining all facts and \nexamining evidence in each specific case. At the same time, valid reasons for \nfiling a lawsuit after exp iry of the limitation period are deemed such \ncircumstances that make timely filing of a claim impossible or difficult.”  \n“In its decision dated 03 April 2008 in case of “Ponomarev v. Ukraine”, the \nEuropean Court of Human Rights  concluded that legal system of many \nmember states provides for the possibility of extending periods of limitation \nif there are reasonable grounds for doing so. ” \nand \n“In the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in case ‘Ilian v. \nTurkey ’ it is stated that the rule on restricting access to court due to expiration \nof a time limit for appeal must be applied with some flexibility and without \nextreme formalism, it must not be applied automatically and shall not be \nabsolute; when monitoring its applic ation one should pay attention to \ncircumstances of each individual case.”  \n1842.  However , although the test of “valid reasons” is highly fact specific , I accept the \nDefendants’ submission that the fact that  a claimant did not have the full limitation \nperiod to investigate its claim or bring proceedings will not in itself imply that it had \nvalid reasons for failing to file its claim in time .  This was illustrated by Mr Beketov’s \nanswer i n cross -examination , when he  was asked about the situation in which a claimant \nwas disabled from bringing proceedings for two years  of the limitation per iod and at \nthe beginning of the third year he knew the full facts  and could have brought the \nproceedings if he had wanted to, but had “just either carelessly or deliberately chosen \nto delay ”.  It was put to him that this would  be a matter of the claimant’s  decision not \nto bring the proceedings in time , and would mean that there would not be an objective \nreason justifying a disapplication of the limitation period , because the claimant could \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n445 \n have brought the proceedings  in time  if it had chosen to do so .  His answer was \n“Potentially , yes. ” \n1843.  In my view , the evidence supports a conclusion that, if there was a material period of \ntime during which it could no longer be said that the “timely filing of a claim [was] \nimpossible or difficult ” (per the Supreme Court in Talant ) and that the claimant  then \nmade a  careless or deliberate choice not to proceed , and it can properly be said that it \nwas not hindered  by any difficulties in maki ng a timely filin g caused by objective \nreasons beyond its control, it is potentially the case that the key  consideration for \napplication of  Article 267(5) will not have been  satisfied . \n1844.  However , the critical point is that this does not address the fact -specific question of \nwhat is capable of amounting to prevention or hindrance.  In a case such as the present , \nthe cases do not focus simply on the question of whether it has become possible  by \nreason of the change of control for the proceedings to be brought because the new \nmanagement have succeeded in acquiring enough information about the potential claim \nto enable proceedings to be issued .

Thus, while the Bank may have been prevented  from suing the Individual Defendants \nuntil the change of control , that does not mean to say that removal of the preventative \nbar when the Bank was nationalised  means that the  Bank might not be significantly \nhindered  for a period of time thereafter  in light of all the circumstances of the case , \nincluding circumstances relating to or ar ising out of what occurred throughout the pre-\nnationalisation period in which the Bank is found to have had the relevant awareness.  \nWhat is required is a careful scrutiny of all the circumstances of the case, both before \nand after the change of control , to work out whether the reasons for the claim not being \nbrought within the limitation period are, having regard to the key considerat ion, valid \nones. \n1846.  This focus on the particular circumstances draws into the analysis the general principles \nof justness, good faith and reasonableness; and the prohibition against abuse of rights.   \nThis can most clearly be seen from Sirius -Bud.  In this case,  the claimant’s sole property \nwas sold at an undervalue, its sale price having been determined by a forged valuation \nreport.  It was then declared bankrupt, and its liquidator sought to have the auction and \nsubsequent sale declared invalid.  There seem to have been proce dural issues in relation \nto the conduct of the bankruptcy , but the li quidator eventually commenced the \nproceedings  almost  four years after the relevant transa ction and more than 18  months \nafter what was called external independent management was introduced .  The Supreme \nCourt found that the impugned auction was invalid  and reject ed a limitation defence .  It \nsaid th e following in the context of its discussion of Article 267(5) : \n“95.2. Evaluating the seriousness of the reasons for missing the limitation periods \nwhen Sirius -Bud PJSC filed this lawsuit, the panel of judges takes into account the \nobvious fraudulent nature of the contested tenders (including the behavio ur of the \ndebtor's management bodies prior to the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings), the \nidentification of signs of such fraud for a long time, including the period of the pre -\ntrial investigation in criminal proceedings No. 42020100000000263 dated \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n446 \n 07/03/2020, within which a significant part of the evidence of fraudulent \ntransactions in dispute was discovered during 2020 and 2021 (experts' conclusions \nof 12/21/2020 and 01/27/2021), lack of external independent management of PJSC \n\"Sirius -Bud\" until Au gust 14, 2019, which was actually established only from the \ndate of declaring the debtor bankrupt and opening the liquidation procedure. ” \n95.3. All these circumstances, fully and correctly established by the courts  of \nprevious instances, give grounds to believe that the reasons for PJSC \"Sirius -Bud\" \nskipping the limitation periods both with regard to the claim to invalidate the results \nof the disputed auctions and with regard to the vindication claim can be considered \nvalid. ” \n1847.

I agree with the Bank ’s submission , supported as it is by Mr Beketov’s evidence , that \none of the important principles illustrated by Sirius -Bud is that it is not appropriate \nsimply to ignore  the period of time in which the relevant corporate entity was subject \nto the control of management  which  was not independent of the wrongdoers and focus \nonly on the period where the new management comes in .  To do so would be over -\nformulaic and  would not give sufficient weight to the guiding principles la id down by \nthe ECHR .  It would also be wholly inconsistent with the pre-bankruptcy conduct of \nthe debtor’s management  referred to in this context by the Supreme Court in Sirius -Bud \nat [95.2] .  It also means that one of the questions the court can and must answer is \nwhether, looking at the period as a whole, and not just the period after the change of \ncontrol, it can be said that the Bank has been significantly hindered in bringing the \naction in due time . \n1848.  It was also clear from Mr Beketov’s evidence that one of the questions that the court \nwill look at where a cla iman t has been actually prevented from bringing the action in \ndue time by objective reasons beyond its control, is whether they acted with reasonable \ndiligence to do so once the preventative bar has been removed.  They may still be \nsignificantly hindered during the period post -change of control by reason of events \nwhich occurred previously .  In my view the evidence supports a conclusion  that, acting  \nwith reasonabl e diligence to commence proceedings after the change of control  does \nnot mean that the claimant has  to commence process as soon as it has  the information \nto do so . \n1849.  All the circumstances of the case are  capable of being a significant hindrance to \nbringing the action in due time , so long as th ey operate as  objective reasons beyond the \nBank’s control .  Contrary to the Defendants ’ case , which seeks to draw a bright line at \nthe stage at which the change of control occurred, the test may be satisfied even if the \npost-change of control conduct , which is said by the Defendants to amount to \nunreasonable delay,  arises as a result of a re asonably diligent response to  earlier events  \nwhich were themselves beyond the Bank’s control .  It follows from this that there is no \nroom for the sug gestion that  it is necessarily ina ppropriate for new management to delay \nproceedings for a period after they become fully aware of facts sufficient to commence \nlegal proceedings, if what they find when they take over  justifies them in taking that \ncourse .  It would be wrong to conclude that there is a requirement  to proceed with \nexpedition after they reach that state of awareness – even applying the key consideration \nand ignoring all other reasons the need to bring the action in due time does not trump \nall other consideration s so long as the y flow from  objective reasons beyond the Bank’s \ncontrol . \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n447 \n  \nArticle 16(3) of the Civil Code  \n1850.

The Bank initially submitted t hat the Defendants ’ reliance on the \nLimitation Defence to avoid the consequences of their tort ious conduct and the \nobligation that would otherwise arise to pay compensation to the Bank is an abusive \npurpose within Article 13 (3), although in the event Mr Beketov’s evidence did not \nsupport an argument that this provided a free -standing basis for disapplying the \nlimitation period . \n1851.  I have already set out Article 13 earlier in this judgment for a different reason (see \nparagraph 865 above), but it is convenient to recite it again.  It is entitled “Limits to the \nexercise of civil rights” and paragraphs 2 to 5 are as follows:  \n“(2) When exercising their rights, a person is obliged to refrain from actions that \ncould violate the rights of others, cause harm to the environment or cultural \nheritage.  \n(3) Actions of a person committed with the intent to harm another person, as well \nas the abuse of rights in other forms are not allowed.  \n(4) When exercising civil rights, a person must observe the moral foundations of \nsociety.  \n(5) The use of civil rights for the purpose of unlawful restriction of competition, \nabuse of a monopoly position in the market, and unfair competition is not allowed.”  \n1852.  It was Mr Beketov’s initial evidence that the court has a discretion under Article 16(3) \nto refuse to recognise or uphold a legal right, including a limitation defence, where it \nconcludes that the right is being exercised in an abusive manner or for an abusive \npurpose.   This principle is capable of being applied in relation to the claims in tort and \nthe claim in unjust enrichment.  He refer red to it as abuse of rights . \n1853.  Mr Alyoshin and Mr Nahnybida disagreed with Mr Beketov on the basis that Article \n16(3) was not applicable in the context of limitation periods.  They said that any such \napplication would be unnecessary in view of a claimant’s ability to invoke Article \n267(5) in an appropriate case.  In his initial report, Mr Alyoshin said that, if the reasons \nfor missing the limitation period are not compelling (for which now read “valid”), he \ndid not see how it could be an abuse of the defendants’ rights to rely on the exp iry of \nthe period.  If such a construction is to be given to the abuse of rights doctrine, it would \nbe logical to conclude that the concepts of prevention and hindrance used in the agreed \ntranslation of Article 267(5) should be given a construction which r eflects the policy \nunderpinning that doctrine.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n448 \n 1854.  Initially Mr Beketov cited no Ukrainian authority which gave direct support to his \nargument, but he identified a decision of the Supreme Commercial Court of the Russian \nFederation , (case No. 17912/09, Priokskoye LLC  v. Aquamarine LLC ) which held that \na limitation defence may be dismissed as an abuse of rights in appropriate \ncircumstances.  How ever, i n his supplemental report, Mr Beketov found more \nsubstantial support for his opinion in Sirius-Bud, which he explained as follows:  \n“That the abuse of rights rule can be applied to defeat a limitation defence has now \nbeen confirmed by the Supreme Court’s resolution Sirius-Bud.  In that case, the \nclaimant’s property (real estate) was mortgaged, foreclosed against and then \nalienated by one defendant through a fraudulent process involving a purported sale \nof the property at auction at a very significant undervalue followed by a r apid \nsuccession of transfers"}

The defendants raised a limitation defence against the claimant’s claim \nto recover the property, but the defence was rejected on the basis that, in view of \nthe defendants’ actions in fraudulently causing the claimant’s property to be \ntransferred away, it was an abuse of right f or the defendants to apply to strike out \nthe claim on grounds of limitation.”  \n1855.  The passage from Sirius-Bud on which Mr Beketov relied in support of this opinion is \nin the same part of the Supreme Court’s resolution as the passages which relate to the \napplication of Article 267(5).  They were as follows:  \n“94.4.  The statute of limitations is an institution of substantive and not procedural \nlaw and cannot be restored (renewed) in case of its expiration, but the plaintiff is \nentitled to receive judicial protection if the reasons for missing the statute of \nlimitations are recognized as valid (part 5 of Article 267 of the Civil Code of \nUkraine).  \n94.5.   For these reasons, the application of the statute of limitations is subject to the \ngeneral principles of substantive civil law, which constitutes fundamental rules as \nwell as the rules of direct action (Supreme Court decision of 25 January 2021 case \nNo. 758/10761/13 -ts), including general provisions on fairness, good faith and \nreasonableness as a general standard of conduct for participants in civil relations.  \n94.6.  In this regard, this significantly weakens  the position of the defendants who \nare involved in fraud transactions and are protected from the claim for invalidation \nof such transaction and derivative claims by reference to the omission of the statute \nof limitations by the plaintiff, because accordin g to the content of Part 3 of Article \n16 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, in case of abuse of rights, the court may deny the \nperson protection. The provision applies not only to the plaintiff, who requests the \nuse of certain means of protection, but also to the defendant, who defends himself \nagainst the claim by filing certain objections (including claiming the plaintiff’s \nomission of the statute of limitations)”.  \n1856.  The result of Mr Howard’s cross -examination of Mr Beketov on this part of Sirius -Bud \nwas that he accepted that the decision to disapply the limitation period  in that case  was \nmade under  Article 267(5), and abuse of rights was referred to only in that context .  The \neffect of his evidence was that he  agreed that there is no suggestion that abuse of rights \nmight be an independent basis for rejecting a limitation defence in a case in which if \nArticle 267(5)  not engaged.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n449 \n 1857.  However, Mr Hunter submitted in his oral closing submissions  that these passages \ndemonstrated that the court in Ukraine will take into account the fact that the relevant \nproceedings are a fraud claim and that the defendants who were defending themselves \nagainst the proceedings  were also responsible for the claim not being brought for the \nfirst two years of the limitation  period. He submitted that it is apparent from [74.6] of \nthe resolution  that the Supreme Court was fortified in its conclusion s on this point  by \nthe application of Article 16 (3). \n1858.

I think that there is substance in that submission.   It is unnecessary to determine whether \nor not an abuse of rights gives rise to a free standing ground for disapplication of the \nlimitation  period .  However, i n my view,  it is clear from Sirius -Bud that a court in \nUkraine would have regard  to the abuse of rights doctrine spelt out in Article 16 (3) \nwhen determining whether in all the circumstances of the case,  the court ought to \nexercise its discretion to disapply the limitation period. That will include giving weight  \nto the period of time  during which a corporate entity was in fact disabled from \nproceeding against its former owners, prior to a change of control . \n \nLimitation: findings on knowledge  and awareness  \n1859.  The next question , which w as also explored in the cross -examination of four of the \nBank’s witnesses , was the state of the Bank’s awareness of  the violation of its rights as \nat 21 December 2014  (i.e. 3 years before the commencement of these proceedings)  as \nproperly to be attrib uted to it through the medium of a number of individuals .  The \nDefendants contended that there were a significant number of such individua ls through \nwhom knowledge could and should be attributed to the Bank for that purpose, and that \ntime therefore started to run for limitation purposes  before that date . \n1860.  The Bank’s position was very different.  I n its opening submissions, it argued that it \nwas only when the Management Board and the Supervisory Board were both replaced \non nationalisation that the new management took control from the Individual \nDefendants and was able to come to the Bank with what Mr Oleksiyenko called “fresh \neyes”.   Ms Pakhachuk and Mr Oleksiyenko both gave evidence that, even then, their \ninitial focus was on investigating and seeking to ensure the Bank’s liquidity.  It was \nonly in the summer of 2017 that their knowledge of what Ms Pakhachuk called “the \nBank’s histori c non -standard practices” developed to a point where  they could \nunderstand that the Bank ’s operations did not comply with best practice and they could \n“see the idea of potential claims against” the Individual Defendants.  It was then said \nthat they only acquired actual knowledge of the violation of the Bank’s rights sometime \nbetween August and  December 2017 . \n1861.  I addres s this aspect of the dispute  in circumsta nces in which I am  satisfied  that the \nnature of the control over the Bank and its affairs that was exercised by the Individual \nDefendants up to the time of nationalisation , both de facto  and pursuant to their roles \nas controlling members of the Supervisory Board  and the General Meeting, mean that  \ntheirs were the primary state s of mind capable of being attributed to the Bank so as to \nestablish awareness of a violation of its rights for limitation purposes.  T hey were the \nonly persons who , acting together,  had the necessary power and authority to procure \nthe Bank to bring proceedings against themselves  and/or their associate d corporate \nvehicles including the Corporate Defendants .  This meant that no proceedings would or \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n450 \n could have been commenced against them by the Bank without their approval and \nconsent   and it is clear that they would not have allowed that to happen . \n1862.

It is also clear  that the role of the Individual Defendants in what occurred makes it \ninevitable that they were aware of a violation of the Bank’s rights  more than three years \nbefore these proceedings were commenced.  The same can be said about the state of \nmind of anyone who  participated in the Misappropriation in a dishonest manner , by \nacting in the relevant context contrary to its interest s.  However, because it is not in \ndispute that  the Bank could not have become aware of a violation of its rights through \nany of these individuals  even if their status was such that awareness might otherwise \nbe attributable to the Bank through them,  the source of what they might have known is \nirrelevant to the enquiry.  \n1863.  That is not the end of the matter , however,  because Mr Beketov accepted that there \nmight  be circumstances in which knowledge could be attributable  to the Bank through \nothers not authorised to issue the current proceedings (or other proceedings seeking the \nsame relief against the same defendants) .  It is therefore necessary to conside r whether, \nin the context of these proceedings,  the Individual Defendants’ de facto  and de jure  \ncontrol provide the Bank with a complete answer to the Defendants’ limitation defence , \neven though Mr Beketov accepted that knowledge might be attributable through others .  \nIt was argued that  if relevant knowledge was acquired by an officer or employee of the \nBank in the course of performing their duties or where the violation of the Bank’s rights \nwas relevant to the performance of their duties , that amoun ted to knowledge by the \nBank for the purposes of Article 261, a nd the Bank’s remedy was to seek a \ndisapplication of the limitation period pursuant to Article 267(5).  \n1864.  The Bank had two substantive answer s to this point .  The first was that , as a matter of \nfact, the Individual Defendants could have prevented any claim being brought against \nthem whilst they owned the Bank.  It was sai d that , if a member of the Management \nBoard or other senior employee had started to investigate any claims  based on the \ninformation they had, they would have been at least  sacked , rebuffed  or fobbed off.   \nThe consequence would have been that they would not have acquired knowledge of the \nfacts s ufficient to plead the  claim  before 21 December 2014 .  The second was that , even \nif an employee had been given free rein to invest igate  following publication of the \nGlavcom  Article in November 2014 , it would have taken him until well after 21 \nDecember 2014 to obtain sufficient knowledge to start time running . \n1865.  I shall come back to those two answers, but I think it is first necessary  to make findings \non what was known by other senior employees of the Bank , who may not have \nparticipated in the Misappropriation  and in respect of whom there is no evidence of \ndishonest conduc t.  In light of those finding s, I will  then consider whether any \nawareness they had  of a violation of the Bank’s  rights  prior to 21 December 2014  was \ncapable of causing the limitation period to start running .  This will involve an \nexamination of the Bank’s case that, even having the awareness  they had, they did not \nknow enough to justify the commencement of legal proceedings and even if it had been , \nthere was nothing they could have done to protect the Bank’s right s to commence legal \nproceedings had they sought to do so.  \n1866.

It was not therefore said that there was \nanyone sufficiently senior and not implicated in the Misappropriation, who knew all of \nthe facts necessary to establish all the elements of the causes of action at this stag e.  In \nshort the case argued by Mr Kolomoisky proceeded on the basis that it was necessary \nfor at least one of the sources of knowledge he identified to have come to the attention \nof a senior person not implicated in the Misappropriation.  \n1867.  Mr Kolomoisky ’s plead ing of the sources of the  Bank ’s knowledge of the facts and \nmatters on which its claim was based made the follow ing allegations : \ni) The Bank knew of the making of the Relevant Loans as they were authorised by \nthe ECC . \nii) All advances under the Relevant Loans on which the Bank relied were made \nbefore September 2014 and were know n to the Bank because they were recorded \nin the Bank’s accounts with the Borrowers . \niii) Between September and November 2014, most of the Borrowers had sued the \nCorporate Defendants in the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings . \niv) On 7 November 2014 the Glavcom  Article was published  in which Mr \nKolomoisky was accused of misappropriating over US$1 billion of the Bank’s \nfunds and some of the Borrowers and Corporate Defendants were named . \nv) On 13 November 2014, the GPO  instigated a criminal investigation into \nallegations of misappropriation of the Bank’s funds through some of the \nBorrowers  and the Corporate Defendants which were similar to those made by \nthe Bank in these proceedin gs.  \n1868.  In their closing submissions, and to this extent consistently with Mr Kolomoisky’s \npleaded case, his counsel identified a number of different sources from which \nindividuals of sufficient seniority within the Bank, but who were not implicated in the \nMisappr opriation, did or should have become aware (before 21 December 2014) of the \nviolation of the Bank’s rights.  The sources relied on by the Defendants were the 2014 \nUkrainian Proceedings, the Glavcom Article, the article published by \nLigaBusinessInform as a result of their interview with Ms Gontareva, the Bank’s own \nrecords and public records.  It is clear that relevant information relating to the violation \nof the Bank’s rights was derived by individuals not implicated in the Misappropriation \nfrom each of the se sources, but, in the light of Mr Beketov’s evidence, I think it is \nnecessary to identify the extent to which any of these individuals have been shown by \nthe Defendants to have had a sufficiently complete and reliable picture of what \noccurred.  \n1869.  This task was made no easier because of the manner in which Mr Kolomoisky’s case \nwas advanced and the fact that it was not tied down on the pleadings.  In particular it \nwas not always easy to identify whether it was being said that the court should infer \nthat a particular individual had actual knowledge of relevant facts or whether it was \nbeing said that they would have acquired knowledge of those facts if they had made the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n"}

At one stage there was also some uncertainty as to which of the individuals relied on \nwere implicated in the Misappropriation.  Ms Korotina was the principal example, \nbecause she was said by the Defendants to have been a candidate for having been the \ninfor mant whistleblower I refer to below, while at the same time having been one of \nthe members of the ECC who approved a large number of the Relevant Loans.  But, for \nthe most part, it is not suggested by the Bank that any of the individuals now relied \nupon by  the Defendant as the conduit for knowledge to be attributed to the Bank were \nalso implicated in the Misappropriation.  \n1871.  The other Defendants  put the ir case on the Bank’s awareness for limitation purposes \nmore shortly , relying on the first two allegations made by Mr Kolomoisky .  Mr \nBogolyubov  simply said that the Bank authorised the Relevant Loans and accordingly \nknew and/or could have known about the alleged violation of any rights at the time the \nRelevant Loans were made.   The Corporate Defendants took a similar approach, relying \non the ECC ’s grant of authority  for the Relevant Loans and the making of the Relevant \nDrawdowns  (and the making of the relevant prepayments and their onwards transfers) \ninto accounts at the Bank as particulars of the Bank’s knowledge .  All of this happened \nbefore October 2014 . \n1872.  This way of putting the case was also addressed in Mr Alyoshin’s initial report .  He  \nsaid that , if harm was inflicted on the Bank by drawdown s under the Relevant Loans, \nthe limitation periods must all have expired by the end of August 2017, being  three \nyears after the last of the Relevant Drawdowns.   The reason for this was that the Bank \nwas a party to the Relevant Loans and was in possession of the respective records of \nthe fund transfers .  If, however, the harm consist ed of non -repayment of the Relevant \nLoans, he said that  the limitation period started to run on the date when the Bank was \nfirst aware (actually or constructively) that the Relevant Loans had not been repaid.  \n \nLimitation: t he 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings as a s ource of the Bank’s knowledge  \n1873.  As to t he 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings,  it was said by the Defendants in Mr \nKolomoisky’s closing submissions that the Bank must have become aware  of the m, and \ntherefore the allegations which were made in them,  as soon as they were served on the \nBank  during the course of September and October 2014 .  In particular, the Defendants \nsubmitted that, in the ordinary course, a number of members of the Bank’s legal \ndepartment will have become aware of the m.  They included the head of the legal \ndepartment, Andriy Stupak and his deputy Sergiy Nakorchevskiy.  They also included \nAnastasia Sizova , a chief legal specialist in the Bank’s legal support department an d \nYaroslava Strelchenko  the lead legal specialist of the Bank’s department of demand and \nclaims, both of whom had been issued with powers of attorney specifically to represent \nthe Bank in defending it against the claim for cancellation of the relevant RSA Pledges.  \n1874.

The Defendants also submitted that three other members of the Bank’s legal department \nhad roles which made it likely that they would have been aware of the 2014 Ukrainian \nProceedings: A nna Mazur, the deputy head of the Bank’s Head Office department of \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n453 \n legal support for work with lawsuits against the Bank; Evegenia Bagrova a lawyer in \nMs Mazur’s department; and Taras Levadskiy,  the deputy head of the Bank’s advocacy \nand court support department.   It was only in Mr Kolomoisky’s closing submissions \nthat it was said for the first time that the identified members of the Bank’s legal \ndepartment knew of the 201 4 Ukrainian Proceedings , and even then it was n ot very \nclearly spelt out that this of itself meant that th e individuals concerned were said to have \nbeen the conduit through which awareness  by the Bank of the violations of its rights \nwas obtained . \n1875.  It was also said by the Defendants  that it would have been obvious from the Borrowers’ \nStatements of Claim taken  together, that something was wrong.   Each of the Corporate \nDefendants  had written to each of the Borrowers they were to supply explaining that it \nwas not able to supply the goods they had ordered.  This was too much of a coincidence \nnot least because the RSAs  were for a variety of different goods and it w as implausible \nto think that supply chains for such goods would prove to be problematic at ex actly the \nsame time.   The Statements of Claim identified the Relevant Loans and the Pledges \nsecuring them, and the RSAs  by reference number. The amount s and date s of the \nUnreturned Prepayment s were also identified. This information was said to have been \nsufficient to allow people within the Bank to retrieve the relevant documentation.  \n1876.  I agree that those involved in the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings would have known that \nthe Bank knew of and authorised the Relevant Loans, would have known that the \nRelevant Drawdowns were made before September 2014 and would obviously have \nknown that the Bank was a party to the 2014 Ukrainian  Proceedings.  However, \nalthough they might well have suspected that something was very wrong, it has not \nbeen  establish ed that any particular individual not involved in the Misappropriation \nactually knew  (a) that the Individual Defendants were the true owners and controllers \nof the Borrowers , (b) that either of the Individual Defendants were party to any unlawful \nact or omission  or (c) that the Bank had sustained loss caused by the Relevant \nDrawdowns.   In my view there is also no basis for inferring that at this stage  any of \nthem might have had anything other than a suspicion  that this was indeed the case.  \n \nLimitation: t he Glavcom Article as a source of the Bank’s knowledge  \n1877.  As to the Glavcom Article , I have  summarised its contents and the extent of its \ndissemination within the Bank in paragraphs 432 to 441 above.  Glavcom identified 30 \nof the Borrowers by name and all six of the Corporate Defendants.   It contended that \nmany of the Bank’s \"would -be-borrowers” ha d many things in common with Mr \nKolomoisky’s Privat group and gave a number of examples of the interconnectivity \nbetween  the Borrowers and the Bank.

In his cross -examination of the Bank’s witnesses on this issue, Mr Howard \ncharacterised the Glavcom Article as one which made serious allegations that UAH 11 \nbillion had been siphoned off to foreign companies by issuing loans which did not look \nas if they were likely to be repaid.  He also said that the gravamen of the article was \nthat Mr Kolomoisky need have no concern for what had occurred, because the money \nthat was alleged to have been siphoned off from the Bank had gone to Mr Kolomoisky \nhimself or to h is companies . \n1879.  I agree with what much of  what  Mr Howard submitted as to the actual knowledge of \nalleged facts which would have been acquired by any reader of the Glavcom Article .  \nHowever, t he Bank relied in its closing submissions on two aspects of the story which \nwere not then apparent from the Glavcom Article, and I think that they were correct to \ndo so .  The first was that the information obtained by Glavcom was limited to 29 or 30 \nof the 50 Borrowers , there is no mention of the Share Pledges and there is no mention \nof the role of Mr Bogolyubov .  The second was that the way in which it described the \ninterconnectivity between the Borrowers, the Corporate Defendants and the Individual \nDefen dants was still relatively incomplete .  This was an important point because the \nNBU was unable to make that link in  May 2015 despite the further investigations which \nwere carried out in the light of the NashiGroshi Articles  (see paragraph  468 above) . \n1880.  Notwithstanding this, Mr Howard submitted  that, leaving aside the fact that Glavcom \nwas onl y reporting on part of the sum, namely the US $1.1 billion -odd paid to the \nCorporate  Defendants, and did  not identify all of the  Borrowers, the basic allegation in \nthe Glavcom  Article is effectively identical to the allegation made by the Bank when it \nissued the present proceedings.   I do not agree that this is sufficient to make the Bank \naware of the facts necessary to pursue its claim.  It  is important to bear in min d that , \nwhether or not it is right to characterise Glavcom  as the Ukrainian equivalent of the Sun \n(as Ms Rozhkova did in her evidence and as Mr Akkouh did in his submissions in \nreply), it was still no more than a journalist’s description of what he had discovered \nfrom a number of different sources.  Accepting that it is not necessary for the \nhypothetical innocent member of the Bank’s management to have the evidence which \nwould prove the Bank’s case at trial (see the discussion of the Tatneft test in paragra ph \n1719  above),  I agree that the contents of the Glavcom Article were not a proper basis \non which to advance a claim  without further verification.   It seems to me fanciful to \nsuggest that any such verification could take place in the 44 -day period between the \npublication of the Glavcom Article and 21 December 2014.  \n1881.

One of the ways in which the Defendants sought to address the timing point  was to \nsuggest that at least one  individual at the Bank w as aware of the allegations made in the \nGlavcom Article  prior to t he date of its publication .  There is some evidence that th is \nwas the case . \n1882.  The first and more straightforward reason is that t he Bank was pre -warned of \npublication because three days earlier , the editor contacted the Bank asking for \ncomment, as it had identified from the court’s register that the Bank had made loans to \n30 Borrowers on the security of property right to goods to be delivered to Ukraine.  A \nnumber of questions were asked as to w hy the Borrowers were seeking to terminate the \nBank’s rights under the RSA Pledges with particular reference to the relationship \nbetween loan s by the Bank to the Borrowers and a number of refinancing loans which \nhad been advanced to the Bank by the NBU during the course of the year.

They included Mr Linskiy, who, \nas head of the Bank’s financial and risk department , was responsible for monitoring the \nBank’s financial ratios and capital.  \n1883.  The second reason  is that i t was said that an unidentified informant within the Bank of \nsufficient seniority to persuade  the GPO to open an investigation , learned of the facts \nand matters supporting the Misappropriation and reported them to both the GPO  and \nGlavcom.  It was submitted by the Defendants that this was what  led to the publication \nof the Glavcom Article  and that this w ould place the Bank’s awareness of the violation \nat a time prior to the publication of the Glavcom A rticle .  It was  also then submitted \nthat the court should infer that the Bank ha s made enquiries, knows who the \nwhistleblower was and has chosen not to reveal that information.  Furth ermore , it was \nsaid that the court should draw adverse inferences as to the Bank’s state of awareness \nfrom the fact that the Bank has not revealed the identity of the whistleblower and that \nthe reason it has not done so was that it  knows that the informant was someone \nsufficiently senior within the Bank for his or her knowledge to be attributed to the Bank \nfor the purpose of commencing the limitation period.  \n1884.  Although th e existence of an unnamed whistleblower was suggested to some of the \nBank’s witnesses during the course of Mr Howard’s cross -examinations , the point was \nnot pleaded  or mentioned in opening and, as Mr Akkouh said in his oral closing \nsubmissions on this area , the unnamed whistleblower  did not appear as a source of \nattributed knowledge until service of Mr Kolomoisky’s written closing arguments .  If \nthis new allegation were to have had any significant impact on my ultimate conclusion s, \nI might have t aken a different course, not least because there has been no disclosure by \neithe r part y on the existence,  identity or seniority of any such person .

It was also sa id, \nbased on Mr Oleksiyenko’s evidence , that a formal letter and request from one party to \nstart the GPO’s investigation would have been necessary and that the informant would \nclearly have had to be someone of sufficient seniority within the Bank for the GPO to \nhave taken action.  \n1886.  In Mr Kolomoisky’s closing submissions , it was speculated that the whistleblower \nmight have been Ms Korotina (the Bank’s chief accountant) or Mr  Vetluzhskikh (the \nhead of the Bank’s internal audit department) . It was submitted by the Defendants that \nthey would have been aware of the concerns the NBU had expressed  about collateral in \nthe form of Share Pledges , because they would have seen the NBU’s inspection report \ndated 15 August 2014 (see paragraph 402 above) .  It would have been natural for \nmembers of the Bank’s legal department receiving the claims in the 2014 Ukrainian \nProceedings to have come directly to Ms Korotina or Mr Vetluzhskikh for guidance in \nrelation to the loans that had been made to the Borrowers and the significance of the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n456 \n pledges which the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings sought to annul.   It was also said that , \nas senior members of the Bank’s management , they would have had access to the \nBank’s transaction data.  \n1887.  Neither Ms Korotina nor Mr  Vetluzhskikh  are said by the Bank to have been directly \nimplicated in the Misappropriation  in the sense that there is no evidence that they \nparticipated in the approval of the Relevant Loans .  However, it is material to note that \nthe Bank says that Ms Korotina was one of the members of the Management Board \nwith a small equity stake in the Bank’s shares, who reported to and acted on the \ninstructions of the Individual Defendants, even when contrary to the Bank’s interests .  \nThis submission is supported by e -mail and WhatsApp correspondence with (amongst \nothers) Mr Dubilet and Ms Koryak in relation to a number of different issues .  In my \nview, t he nature of that evidence  (which dates from 2015 and 2016) , and Ms Kor otina’s  \napparent ly unconditional  willingness to a ct in accordance with the Individual \nDefendants’ interest s, is inconsistent with the Defendants ’ case that she may have been \nan informant to Glavcom.  \n1888.  It was also said that the possibility that the whistleblow ing informant  was not an \nemployee or officer of the Bank can be discounted, apparently on the basis that , if it \nhad been an auditor or an employee of the NBU, the Bank would certainly have said so \nin the course of the trial if not before.  This was a very surprising submission in light of \nthe fact that the allegations made by the Defendants on this po int only fully emerged \non service of the Defendants’ written closings.   It is also not made out on th e evidence , \nbecause during the course of th at part of Mr Oleksiyenko’s cross -examination on which \nthe Defendants relied  for this purpose , he made clear that the informant was likely to \nbe “Some insider definitely ”, but what he meant by that w"}

It can be a person who in the know of \nthe UBO private affairs”, i.e. it might  not even have been a Bank official , let alone one \nof sufficient seniority to be capable of having awareness for l imitation purposes in the \npresent context.  \n1889.  In these circumstances, I  do not consider that the evidence  justifies a finding that there \nwas an unnamed senior ranking informant  from within the Bank who had any more \ninformation than that which was reported in the Glavcom Article  or that they were \ncollecting together that information during a period of time prior to its publication .  \nFurthermore, I think that the probabilities are that anyone who suggested to Glavcom \nthat an investigation by them might provide a worthwhile story, is more likely to have \nknown less about what was reported by Glavcom than Glavco m itself acquired and \nreported having regard to the  numbe r of sources  to which the journalist appear s to have \nhad access .  A reading of  both the Glav com Article and the chief editor’s letter to the \nBank’s press officer supports an inference that  the information on which it was \nprimarily based was derived from  the public record in relation to  the 2014 Ukrainian \nProceedings , together with a number of additional facts , which , as is plain from the \nwording of the article itself , were derived from the journalist’s own investigations  that \nmay not have been any form of t ip-off. \n1890.  While I accept that someone from inside the Bank may have suggested to Glavcom that \nthe existence and essential elements of the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings were worthy of \ninvestigation, the tip -off was no more than that  and could have come from  any level of \nseniority within the Bank.   In short, it would be wrong  to infer  that there was an \nindividual within the Bank not implicated in the Misappropriation,  who had any more \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n457 \n information about what had occurred  than that which was  recorded in the Glavcom \nArticle , nor that there is any evidence to suggest that any such person was  of a sufficient \nlevel of seniority within the Bank to be capable of contributing to  the Bank ’s own \naware ness of the violation of its rights.  \n1891.  Furthermore , I do not accept the contention that the GPO would only have acted on the \nback of information derived from an individual  at a particular level of seniority within \nthe Bank  or that the GPO would only in vestigate on the basis of a formal letter from the \nBank itself .  This submission was based on  what was said to have been Mr \nOleksiyenko’s acceptance that , without a tip -off, it would be impossible for a third party \nto have spotted the pattern of judgments emerging on the public registry of judgment s \nin the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings.    I think that the position is more nuanced that that.   \nMr Oleksiyenko ’s evidence was as follows:  \n“I don’t know the basis based on which the GPO opens this particular investigation \nbut I don't think that GPO would open the investigation unless there is a formal \nletter and request from one party to start the investigation.  GPO doesn't open \ninvestigatio ns on a tip.”  \n1892.

He also agreed  with Mr Howard’s suggestion that someone who was in a position to \nexpress an authoritative position must have gone to the GPO to tell them, \"You need to \ninvestigate this\".   In my view, t he most that can be derived from this evidence was the \nview he expressed that someone must  have tipped -off the journalist that what appeared \nfrom the public record of the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings was something to look at .  \nBut his evidence as to the likely seniority of the individual concerned  and that they \nwould have bee n in a position to express an authoritative position  struck me as being \nno more than speculation .  It is also inconsistent with what in fact happened because \nthere is no evidence that a formal letter was written by anyone, and it is most unlikely \nthat an informant would have done so.  This rather cuts across Mr O leksiyenko’s \nevidence that one would have been required before a GPO investigation could be \ninitiated.  \n1893.  In my judgment , this all makes for a  very thin basis for concluding that the GPO only \nstarted its investigation because of information  which wa s brought to its attention by a \nsenior officer of the Bank , or which  amounted to anything more extensive than that \nwhich was disclosed by the Glavcom Article .  The GPO investigation commenced very \nshortly after the Glavcom Article was publishe d, and m uch the more probable order of \nevents is that the GPO commenced its investigation in the light of the Glavcom Article \nand the information which it contained .  I think it is quite possible that the matter was \ndrawn to the GPO’s attention by someone from within the Bank , but the timing is \nconsistent with a conclusion that the GPO considered that it needed to conduct a formal \ninvestigation given the public nature of the documentation referred to in the Glavcom \narticle and the seriousness of the allegations that had been made  affecting as it did a \nlarge proportion of the population of Ukraine , even though it may at that stage have \nappeared possible that the  explanation for what seemed to have occurred  was less \nnefarious tha n that which is now alleged in these proceeding s. \n1894.  What happened with t he GPO’s investigation is also illustrative of another problem \nwith the Defendants’ contention that the Bank (through a senior official not implicated \nin the Misappropriation) was aware of the necessary facts before 21 December 2014.  \nThe evidence is that the investigation was treated by the GPO as relating to the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n458 \n “misappropriation by [Bank] officials of another’s property, namely state funds of the \n[NBU] allocated for refinancing” .  The focus was therefore on misappropriation of the \nNBU’s property  as a criminal  act, rather than the  actionable  harm sustained by the Bank \nitself under Article 1166 , a rather different form of legal complaint .  Furthermore , the \nGPO’s own investigation had made little progress by the end of the year in identifying \nwhat had occurred , in part due to obstruction from inside the Bank .  This r esponse \nincluded refusal  from within the Bank  to provide document ation sought .  There is no \nreason to think that any other form of investigation into the facts of what had or might \nhave occurred would have any more success in identifying the salient facts , itself \nwholly inconsistent with the suggested that there was a  presumed or contemplated \ninevitability  that someone would become reliably aware of sufficient  facts to comm ence \na claim before 21 December 2014.  \n1895.

As to the LigaBusiness Inform  article , I have described what happened in paragraphs \n437 and 438 above .  The interview added  little in itself to the Glavcom Article, but  the \nDefendants relied on the fact that LigaBusinessInform was a more respectable financial \npublication than Glavcom.  I n effect, it was said that the fact that allegations were \nrepeated by LigaBusiness Inform  gave them a greater level of respectability than might \notherwise have been the case . It is also of some relevance that , for the reasons she \nexplained (and cited in paragraph 438 above) Ms Gontareva said during the course of \nthe interview that “ To date, I have no complaints about Privat .” \n1896.  The Defendants then submitted that there were a significant number of individuals who \nhad read or knew about the contents of the Glavcom Article on or as a result of  its \npublication .  The evidence that some of them knew is derived from their \ncommunications with KPMG  (see paragraphs 434 to 436 above ).  This group included \nMs Korotina , Mr Vetluzhskikh  and Ms Kucher.  I agree that it is lik ely that each of \nthem read the Gla vcom Article at the time and I also agree that it is lik ely that they all \nappreciated that it raised serious questions as to the Bank’s conduct, although the extent \nto which they knew all of the fact s necessary  to establish a cause of action is wholly  \nunclear.  \n1897.  The Def endants submitted that , in light of the widespread correspondence on the subject \nwithin the Bank, it is improbable that there was any member of the Management Board \nwho did not read the Glavcom Article .  They also submitted that , having omitted them \nfrom the most recent list of members of the Management Board alleged to have been \ncomplicit in the Misappropriation, the Bank implicitly identified the following \nmembers of the Management Board as people whose knowledge could be attribut ed to \nthe Bank: Roman Nehynskiyi and Alexander  Vityaz (both deputy chairs) and Igor \nTeryokhin ( head of financial monitoring).   Similar submission s were made in relation \nto the following m embers of the Credit Committee who were not also members of the \nECC , none of whose integrity has been impug ned and all of whom  continued in the \nemployment of the Bank after nationalisation : Oleksii Shaban , Andriy Tanankov , \nAlexander Nikolenko , Aleksandr Sokolov sky and Mr Shevchenko.  \n1898.  I agree that it is unlikely that these individuals did not read or become aware of the \ncontents of the Glavcom Article at or shortly after the time of its publication , although \nthere is little positive evidence that they did .  For reasons that I shall summarise shortly \nI do not accept that th is means that any of them would have therefore a cquired sufficient \nknowledge to enable t he commencement of proceedings by the Bank against the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n459 \n Individual Defendants (even if that had been something that any one or more of them \nwould otherwise have been able to achieve ). \n \nLimitation: o ther records as a source of the Bank’s knowledge  \n1899.

Ms Rozhkova agreed that anyone \nlooking at the RSAs would see that they were incredible on their face.  Indeed it was \nnot really contested that the absurd quantities of goods that the Corporate Defe ndants \nhad agreed to deliver , together with the other terms I have already described , made it \nobvious that something improper was going on . \n1900.  The Defendants also submitted that, a lthough Glavcom had only identified 30 of the \noriginal 46 Ukrainian Borrowers, all 43 claimants in the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings \nwould have been known to the Bank’s l egal department through the claims they had \nfiled by mid -November  2014 .  It was accepted that lawyers in that department would \nnot have known of the arbitration claims because the Bank had not been joined as a \nparty.   However, it was said that both the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings  and the Glavcom \nArticle revealed the Corporate Defendants as  defaulting Suppliers  and a  search of the \nBank ’s transaction data w ould have revealed all the other Borrowers who had made \nprepayments to one or more of the Corporate Defendants  more than three months \nearlier.  \n1901.  The Bank said that the Intermediary Loan repayments would have had to be \ninvestigated to understand the detail of what had occurred , but t he Defendants \nsubmitted that, so far as repayment of the Relevant Loans was concerned, the Bank’s \nrecords would have revealed that other BOK clients had taken out loans and used the \nproceeds to repay some but not all of the Relevant Loans and that some Relevant Loans \nwere being used to repay others .  It was also said by the Defendants that, i n any event, \nthe implication o f the complaints being made by the Borrowers in the 2014 Ukrainian \nProceedings was that they would be short of funds to repay the Bank and would \ntherefore be unable to comply with the legislative requirement s to return the \nprepayments on non -delivery.  \n1902.  It was also said that , if the Share Pledges had been produced, there would have been no \nreason to believe they would be available for enforcement.   This was because, as Mr \nKolomoisky submitted, it was no secret that the companies whose shares had been \npledged were companies owned and/or controlled by  the Individual Defendants .  It was \nsubmitted that, whatever the value of the companies may have been at any particular \npoint in time, there was no guarantee that the Share Pledges would remain valuable if \nanyon e tried to enforce them .  This was because assets could be removed from the m \nbefore any enforcement action was taken.  \n1903.  As to the public records, it was apparent from the Nashi Groshi Articles  that some of \nthe connections between the Corporate Defendants and the Bank and other Privat group \ncompanies  could have been identified or confirmed  from  publicly available \ninformation . NashiGroshi’s work (albeit carried out at the beginning of 2015 and so \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n460 \n less than three years before the commencement of the proceedings)  also established that \nit was possible to identify  links between the Borrowers and the Bank  through a \ncombination of searching Google and “exploring the Unified State Register and register \nof court decisions  and correlating money withdrawals with loss of Ukraine’s foreign \ncurrency reserves” .

The refore it was said that these  were all publicly available sources \nof information , which were as much available to the Bank in any investigation , carried \nout in response to the Glavcom Article and at the instigation of senior individuals not \nalleged to have been complicit in the Misappropriation , as they were available to \nNashiGroshi early the follo wing  year.  It is said that it would have been evident to all \nof these individuals that all of the Relevant Loans were for the benefit of companies \nowned and/or controlled by Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov and were inadequately \nsecured, which on the Bank’s case would  have completed its cause of action.  \n \nThe Bank’s answer to the extent of its awareness pre -21 December 2014  \n1904.  As I have already explain ed (see paragraph  1864  above) and q uite apart from its \nargument s in relation to the knowledge of the Individual Defendants  and others who \nparticipated in the Misappropriation, t he Bank had two answers to this way of \napproach ing the allegation s of awareness of the violation of its rights in the period prior \nto 21 December 2014 .  The first  was that there was no real prospect  of any employee \nof the Bank, at whatever level, being permitted by the Individual Defendants to \ninvestigate  the circumstances surrounding the Misappropriation , so as to give them as \nindividua ls sufficient awareness  of the facts to enable a  claim  under Article 1166 to be \npleaded  against any of the Defendants .  It was said that , had they sought to do so , they \nwould have been sacked , rebuffed  or fobbed off.   The second is that , even if there was \na Bank employee who had been given free rein to investigate the position subsequent \nto the publication of the Glavcom A rticle , they would not have identified all the facts \nnecessary to complete  the Bank’s cause of action before 21 December 2014 . \n1905.  As to the first of these points , the Bank submitted  that it is incredible to suggest that \nany Management Board member  or other senior members of the Bank’s management \nnot implicated in the Misappropriation would have  been able to  investigate allegations \nof a huge fraud perpetrated by the Individual Defendants  against the Bank in late 2014.   \nAn investigation into the source of the information leak to Glavcom or the GPO by \nsomeone who was trusted by the Defendants was one thing .  That was probably why \nMr Lins kiy was appointed to conduct the investigation into how Glavcom had acquired \nthe information it had .  But an investigation by an in dependent senior member of the \nManagement Board would have been quite another.  The Bank submitted, and I agree , \nthat the reaction which any such investigation would have provoked in Mr Kolomoisky  \nreflects the internal culture within the Bank (see the section of this judgment dealing \nwith the exercise by Mr Kolomoisky of influence and control over the Bank and its \naffairs)  and is illustrated by the sort of threat against Ms Rozhkova I described at the \nbeginning of this judgment (see paragraph  60 above ). \n1906.  I was also shown evidence of other behaviour by Mr Kolomoisky , which illustrated the \nforcefulness with which  he would act in order  to get his own way .  Two examples  of \nthis evidence dating fr om 2014 make the point.  The first was video footage played in \ncourt of Mr Kolomoisky, who had a substantial private army, using armed men in \ncombat fatigues and ski masks to seize the offices of the majority state -owned \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n461 \n Ukrtransnafta .

The exercise was witnessed by journalists and recorded the use by Mr \nKolomoisky of abusive, aggressive and threatening language, liberally laced with \nexpletives.  The second was a report in the Washington Post  which contended that  Mr \nKolomoisky , who had what was described as his own army , was “flouting central \nauthority by interdicting aid convoys headed to the Donbas and permitting brigades he \nfinances to engage in activities that contravene the law” .  Their significance lies in the \nfact that they reflect behaviour by Mr Kolomoisky at the same time as it is now \nsuggested that individuals might have been prepared to conduct an investigation into \nwhether and if so how the Bank may have claims against Mr Kolomoisky  (as suggested \nby the  Glavcom Article ). \n1907.  There were other examples in the evidence, as well, all of which reported events the \ntruth and accuracy of which were not challenged by Mr Kolomoisky.  It is not necessary \nfor me to describe them in any detail but they included serious threats to the perso nal \nsafety of Ms Gontareva.   She was prepared to tell the press in a November 2019 \ninterview she gave to the Guardian newspaper, that he was behind the use of hitmen \nwho drove into her on a pedestrian crossing in Knightsbridge, set her son’s car on fire \nin Kyiv and burnt down her family home.   This added to the  evidence as to the type of \nbehaviour of which Mr Kolomoisky was  capable and generally known to be capa ble \nboth at this stage , and later on once the Bank had been nationalised .  It has contributed \nto my  conclusion that it is inconceivable that any employee who wished to keep his job \nwould have undertaken an investi gation  to obtain the necessary information to establish \nthe facts sufficient to plead a claim against the Defendants . \n1908.  There was no real attempt made by  the Defendants  to identify who might have been \nprepared to carry out an investigation (the whistleblower speculation fell far short of \nthat) or to provide any analysis as to why they might have done so , even if they might \nhave been under a duty to do so .  At on e stage Mr Kolomoisky seemed to have been \nsuggest ing that Mr Linskiy was a candidate for a person through whom attributable \nawareness pre-21 December 2014 might have been established against the Bank, but \nthe written closing argument did not in the event make that allegation and in any event \nI think that any attribution through him  would have been  most improbable .  Although \nhe was  described in the evidence as an important employee, he was not a senior \nexecutive let alone a member of the Management Board .  However, h e was involved in \napproving almost all of t he Relevant Loans , and , in his role as head of the finance and \nrisk department , was entrusted with investigating the leak to Glavcom  – not to get to \nthe bottom of what occurred but to identify whether anyone might have given Glavcom \na tip-off and if so who that might have been . \n1909.  The reason that a spotlight was shone on Mr Linskiy was that he  remained  an employee \nof the Bank post -nationalisation  involved in investigating what was by then referred to \nas the Bank’s “toxic portfolio” of loans to companies related to Mr Kolomoisky .  It was \nsubmitted on behalf of Mr Kolomoisky that he was therefore available to be  called by \nthe Bank which sh ould have taken that course .

It is said that this should have been done \nbecause he had  significant knowledge of what had been going on and was trusted as \nsomeone who had at the time toed the party line.   I do not accept that submission . \n1910.  Leaving aside the fact that Mr Kolomoisky did not plead a case of constructive \nknowledge against the Bank , and despite what I have earlier described as the shifting \nevidential burden of proof,  none of the Defendants sought to call Mr Linskiy eithe r.  I \ncan draw no inferences one way or the other from his absence from the witness box, \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n462 \n because I have no information on whether he would or might have been a willing \nwitness for either side.  Even if the Bank h ad been able to anticipate the case which \nappeared to be being developed during the course of cross -examination, the possibility \nthat Mr Linskiy  may not have been available to the Bank  was illustrated by Ms \nPakhachuk’s oral evidence .  She explained the  difficulties the Bank ’s new management \nhad in operating under the shadow of the Individual Defendants’ surviving influence \npost-nation alisation  in the following terms (and I accept as accurate the evidence which \nshe gave) : \n“We could not replace about 20,000 of staff. We remained working with the \nexisting staff but we tried to engage new people just to be able to manage this huge \ninstitution. We couldn’t spend all our time just for replacement of the staff, so we \ntook it in stages and we tried to hire staff as fast as we could and, yes, we used our \nold resources  and, yes, we used our old resources, and that's why we  need a lot of \ntime in order to come back to the same  matters and to do verifications because we \ncouldn't  always trust the information they were providing to us,  but along with that, \nwe were very confident going alon g the strategy as to restorations on Bank's work. ” \n1911.  The Bank submitted that the individuals through whom the Defendants sought to \nattribute kn owledge seem to have included Ms Rozhkova, the First Deputy Governor \nof the NBU, which was of course the Bank’s regulator .  If that had been had Mr \nKolomoisky’s case it would have been misconceived but I do not t hink that it was.  Mr \nHoward ’s cross -examination was directed to what the NBU knew by the time of \nnationalisation on which it was then able to brief the Bank’s new management in \nJanuary 2017.  It therefore did not go to the question of whether the NBU’s knowledge \ncould have been attribute d to the Bank before December 201 4 for the purposes of \nArticle 261 ; rather it went to the question of whether the court ought to exercise its \npower under Article 267(5) to disapply the limitation period if the Bank had otherwise \nbeen actually or constructively aware of the violat ion of its rights more than three years \nbefore the commencement of these proceedings.  I accept the Bank’s submission that \nthere is no basis for attributi ng any awareness of the Glavcom Article to the Bank \nthrough Ms Rozhkova.  \n1912.

The Bank’s starting point was that Mr Kolomoisky realistically acknowledged that, in \nand of itself , the Glavcom Article did not provide sufficient information to  enable the \nBank to plead a case against  the Individual Defendants .  As Mr Howard explained in \nopening his client’s cas e, what the Glavcom Article  served to do was to put the Bank \non enquiry  that it might have been defrauded and that the  Individual Defendants were \nthe beneficiaries of the fraud .  This is consistent with the fact that , when the GPO \ninstituted its pre -trial investigation six days later on 13 November 2014, the initial \nresponse  of the Bank's legal department was to refuse to provide the GPO with \ndocuments unless  they obtained a court order .  This is an unpromising start for an \nallegation  that further inquiries could have put a senior member of the Bank’s \nmanagement who had not participated in the Misappropriation  into possession of \nsufficient material to plead a claim.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n463 \n 1914.  The Bank submitted that , as the Glavcom Article was published at 6.30pm on 7 \nNovember 2014 and the Claim Form was issued on 21 December 20 17, the Defendants \nmust  establish that, within 44 days of reading the  article, an investigator would have \nacquired knowledge of facts sufficient to allow the Bank to allege each element  of its \nclaim .  It said that this was  unrealistic .  It was said that t he hypothetical investigator \nwould have needed to gather and review the loan documentation for the loans to the 30 \nBorrowers identified in the Glavcom Article, including client questionnaires, financial \nstatements, loan applications, minutes of meetings approving the borrowing and loan \nagreements , which can now be seen to run to several t housand  pages .  This task would \nhave been likely to take several weeks.   They would also have needed to review  the 20 \npublished judgments in the 2014 Ukrainian Proceedings  and the further 31 judgments \nwhich were published  during the course of the 44 day period  and then review the \nadditional  loan documentation for the further c.20 Borrowers identified as a result of \nreviewing those further judgments.  \n1915.  I think it likely that this kind of investigation would exceed what was necessary to \nensure that the investigator was reliable informed of the necessary facts, but there is no \ndoubt that a lot of work would have had to be done and t he hypothetical investigator \nwould also have need ed to establish that the Individual Defendants  were indeed the true \nowners and controllers of all 50 of the Borrowers  with a sufficient degree of reliability  \nto justify a plea in fraud .  I was cautioned against applying the English rules of pleading, \nbut a properly sustainable case based on reliable information would still have been \nrequired.  As I have already explained suspicion and good faith belief are not of \nthemselves enough for this purpose .  That would have been a difficult task  on the \nevidence the n available , not least bec ause the most recent NBU related party list dated \n1 October 2014  failed to identify that any of the Borrowers were the Bank’s related \nparties , and ind eed specifically asserted that a number of them (Celastrina, Fiastra , \nImris, Inkom , Tseris and AEF were identified by Mr Akkouh in his oral closing \nsubmissions) were not.

The most recent IFRS shareholder representation letter dated \nas at 31 December 2013  (the copy in the papers was signed by Mr Kolomoisky but \ncontained an uncompleted signature block for Mr Bo golyubov) was to the same effect.  \n1916.  I also agree that, the fiendish complexity of many of the structures through  which the \nBorrowers were owned and controlled would have made it impossible for anyone to \nhave gained enough information on th e issues to enable them to plead a case against the \nIndividual Defendants  in the time available .  It is obvious that nobody implicated in the \nMisappropriation would have provided any information to help , and inde ed subsequent \nevents (including the changes introduced to conceal the true beneficial ownerships as \nreflected in the Luchaninov e -mail) indicate that it was likely that  they would have been \nhampered  in their task by the ownership structures being changed . \n1917.  I also accept that a  similar conclusion can be reached having regard to what \nsubsequ ently occurred on  the publication of the NashiGroshi Articles.  The NBU \nresponded with Request 27 (see paragraph 444 above).   This led to a stalling response \nfrom Mr Dubilet in a  letter dated 19 February 2015 asserting that  “the said loan \noperations were performed in full compliance with the requirements of the law” and \nproviding list s of the loans to the 42 Borrowers, the RSAs and a 26 page description of \nthe collateral.  When it was suggested that the NBU knew by reason of Request 27 that \n“the supply contracts were shams”, Ms Rozhkova  responded:  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n464 \n “I cannot agree with it, my Lord, because to clarify the situation, NBU requires \nsome additional documents and my further experience, when I work with the bank \nmanagement, give me -- I can suggest that the Bank provide a lot of explanations \nthat all these contracts and borrowers is real and good.”  \n1918.  In light of what Mr Dubilet told the NBU  about the security , it could not be said that \nthe hyp othetical investigator would have had sufficient information to justify a claim \nagainst the Defendants until they had had sufficient time to  gather each security \nagreement and assess whether the security was valid and valuable or a sham in the light \nof the vastly  inflated prices  attributable to the assets .  In this regard,  any investigator \nwould have been faced with assertions that (a) the Relevant Loans were  secur ed by \nshares in valuable companies with significant production and trading activities which \nwere generating cashflows and holding real assets ; and (b) that t his security was \nexamined and accepted by PwC over successive audits .  This has been  the position of \nMr Kolomoisky throughout these proceedings , but some understanding of whether the  \nBank had valuable security to the extent of the Relevant  Loans was an essential part of \nassessing whether the claims now made  were then pleadable . \n1919.  To like effect was the response of the NBU’s NashiGroshi audit team when they \nreported back  on 15 May 2015 .  As I explained in paragraph 468 above , they concluded \nthat, although the majority of customers were “interrelated to each other according to \nthe ownership structure” , the 42 Borrowers were not linked to the Individual \nDefendants or other Bank insiders.

The way it was put was \nthat “[n]o facts have been found of relatio nships of the non -resident legal entities, the \nowners of the Branch’s customers, with the insiders and the Bank’s related parties.”  \n1920.  In my judgment the Bank was justified in relying  on this evidence  as demonstrating that \nthere was no prospect that anyone not involved in the Misappropriation could have \nobtained sufficient information to plead a case within 44 days of the Glavcom Article \nbeing published.   I accept the Bank’s submission  that these examples of what happened \nwhen attempts were made by the NBU  to investigate what had been alleged in the \nNashiGroshi  Article  in 2015, corroborate s the Bank’s case.  F or so long as the Bank  \nwas controlled by the Individual Defendants , any innocent employee or Management \nBoard member would not have been able to obtain sufficient knowledge to plead and \nissue a claim  by the Bank against the Individual Defendants, even if they had had the \npower and authority under the Bank’s Charter to do so, which they would not have had \nin any event.  \n1921.  Even if 44 days had been sufficient to enable the innocent hypothetical investigator to \ncorroborate Glavcom’s reporting of the broad structure  of what had occurred , I think it \nis probable that, a s with the NBU , any such person  would have been  given false \ninformation as to the Borrowers’ beneficial ownership.  In my judgment, t his was a \nfurther reason why there was never any prospect of anyone being in a position to \nprocure the issuing of proceedings by the Bank against any of the Defendants.  Even if \nthat m ight have been permitted by those in position to procure the Bank to sue, they \nwould not have been able to take that steps on the basis of the information available to \nthem.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n465 \n 1922.  In these circumstances, I accept the Bank’s submission  and find  that, even if it were \ncorrect that a hypothetically diligent and non -implicated person would have concerns \nabout the terms of the Relevant Loans or the status of the Borrowers , they would not \nhave identified enough of what is now known about  the role of the  Defendants to enable \nproceedings to be brought  and it is likely  that reasonable diligence would never have \nled anywhere other than to their dismissal .  The consequence of this is that I fin d that \nthe Bank was not aware of the violation of its rights (including the persons in the form \nof the Defendants respo nsible for violating  its rights) s o as to give rise to the starting of \nthe limitation period at any time prior to 21 December 201 4.  The Limitation Defence \nfor the purposes of its claims under Article 1166 therefore fails.  \n \nApplication of Article 2 67(5) : the position of the Bank  \n1923.  In the light of the conclusions I have reached on the Bank’s  state of awareness on 21 \nDecember 2014, three years before the issue of these proceedings, it is not necessary \nfor me to consider what occurred thereafter.

In a case such the present , where  a material part of the delay occurred  during a period \nin which the Individual Defendant s remained in control of the Bank , it is clear from \ncases such as Sirius -Bud that the starting point is that the Bank will have been prevented \nfrom bringing its claim s during the p eriod prior to the change in management.  However \nit is also clear from Sirius -Bud that, merely because change of control removed what \namounted to an absolute impedim ent to the commencement of legal process up to that \ntime,  the court  does not then  ignore what happened before the change  of control. N or \ndoes it mean that the court must look at the period after the change of control  through \nthe blinkered spectacles of ignoring what  occurred before .  In my judgment, t he task of \nthe court is to look at the whole of the period and all the circumstances, including \nwhether the conduct complained of wa s fraudulent, whether the old management was \nimplicated, whether there were steps taken to conceal it, and whether the investigation \nof the true facts was complicated.  \n1925.  It was submitted by the Bank that, o n the extreme facts of this case, all of those factors \nwere present and all justify disapplication.   It was also submitted that the Bank’s new \nmanagement, installed in late December 2016, plainly acted reasonably in their \napproach to investigating and commencing the claim, which they managed to do within \na year.   They were presented with the nearly impossible  task of stabilising a systemic \nbank that had been catastrophically mismanage d, they worked 14 -hour days, seven day s \na week, for the first three months to stave off a run  on the Bank (which, given the Bank’s \nsize, may have led to civil unrest and/or the collapse of the Ukrainian financial system) \nand they established a unit to investigate  related party lending which looked into the \n200+ related -party loans and the purported security for them .  It was submitted that, \nagainst that background, it was wholly reasonabl e to give the Individual Defendants a \nshort period (until July 2017) to make good on the promise that they h ad made in an \nopen letter to the Prime Minister  that they would, by 1 July 2017 , “ensure the \nrestructuring of loans extended by the Bank to legal persons”  (see paragraph 582 above) \nand to instruct solicitors when that promise was broken.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n466 \n 1926.  I have touched on a number of these points during the course of describing what in fact \nhappened in the period between nationalisation and the commencement of these \nproceedings, but i n its closing submiss ions the Bank summarised the key t asks \nundertaken by its new management during the course of 2017 under nine separate \nheadings as illustrative of why it submitted that this is a paradigm case for the court to \ndisapply the limita tion period .  It submitted that Sirius -Bud sets out a multifactorial \ngeneral dis cretion type test for the purposes of Article 267 (5), which meant that one of \nthe things the court has to consider is whether there was undue delay on the part of the \nBank, and the nine separate headings itemise different but interlinked reasons why that \nwas not the case . \n1927.  It was also submitted that, i n making an assessment  of whether alapse of time  between \nnationalisation and the commencement of these proceedings amounted to  undue delay , \nthe court would be assisted by considering  three distinct periods.

It was also submitted that, i n making an assessment  of whether alapse of time  between \nnationalisation and the commencement of these proceedings amounted to  undue delay , \nthe court would be assisted by considering  three distinct periods.   The first was a period \nof firefighting , which was followed by getting information in relation to related party \nloans into one place.   The second was a period during the Rothschild negotiations .  The \nthird was a period in which the claim was worked up following the instruction of Hogan \nLovells.  \n1928.  The Bank’s first to fourth reasons fall into the first period, during which its new \nmanagement was seeking to  stabilis e the Bank.  It said, and I accept , that immediately \npost-nationalisatio n, the Bank’s new management  were in firefighting mode . They  had \ntaken over the running  of a bank which was systemic to the Ukrainian banking system  \nwith more than 20,000  employees and more than  20 million customers in what can \nproperly be described as a state of disarray .  The  Bank had  what Ms Pakhachuk said \nwas an  “eno rmous cash flow problem”, with liabilities of more than US$6  billion, \navailable cash of US$70  million  and customers regularly withdrawing deposits .  The \nBank was obviously more secure whilst in the ownership of the state, but s he believed \nthat there  was the real possibility of civil unrest if ordinary Ukrainians became unable \nto access their deposits . \n1929.  The new Supervisory Board was given a list of priority tasks by the NBU on 6 January \n2017, with a 293 -page audit report detailing the extent of the Bank’s dysfunctionality \nfollowing on 30 January 2017 .  I accept Ms Pakhachuk’s evidence that for the first few \nmonths everyone on the Management Board w as at their absolute limit s in seeking to \nfulfil those tasks.  \n1930.  The second heading was what the Bank called “dealing with poison pills ”.  Ms \nPakhachuk said, and I accept , that the Bank’s  new management had to create an \norganisational structure “almost from scratch”, a task made more diffi cult because the \nmost senior pre -nationalisation executives (including M r Dubilet, Ms Gurieva  and Mr \nNovikov ) had left the Bank  without any transfer of their work.   Other problems included \nthe fact that some of the  Bank’s staff had what appeared to the Bank’s new management \nto be an enduring loyalty to the Individual Defendants .  Thi s me ant that their \nsubordinates were not necessarily going to be helpful all of the time , a problem which \nthey had to work around as best they could.  \n1931.  None of this was helped by the fact that t he state of the Bank’s records was plainly \ndeficient .  Perhaps the most striking example of this was something I have described \nmuch earlier in this judgment relating to the documentary recor d.  It was Ms \nPakhachuk’s unchallenged evidence  that, by the time she started work at the Bank \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n467 \n immediately after nationalisation, the Investment Business had been “ stripped of \neverything: the filing cabinets were completely empty and even the plug sockets had \nbeen  removed from the wall ”.  Another linked problem  was said to be the need to deal \nwith claims which had been filed in Ukraine and Cyprus by former clients of the Bank, \nagainst the so -called “bail -in” process which was associated with the Bank’s \nnationalisation . \n1932.  The third heading  related to the establishment of Mr Stratonov’s related -party loans \nunit, the details of which I have given in  paragraphs 591 to 596 above.   It is possible to \ngain some sense of the amount of work which had to be done by Mr Stratonov’s unit \nfrom his 6 March 2017 report . The tasks  included a d"}

It is possible to \ngain some sense of the amount of work which had to be done by Mr Stratonov’s unit \nfrom his 6 March 2017 report . The tasks  included a detailed analysis of what he called  \nthe transformed loans  (to be completed by 30 March 2017 ), a full and detailed check of \ncollateral for loan and lease agreements (to be completed by 30 April 2017 ), the \nproduction of a full set of credit documents  and a separate archive segment for keeping \nthem (to be completed by 30 April 2017 ) and the formation of an information base for \nclaim -related work . \n1933.  The fourth reason flowed from the appointment of EY as the Bank’s new auditors on \n17 January 2017 .  This led to  a very difficult process for the audit of the Bank’s first set \nof post -nationalisation accounts  and extensive investigations by EY into the Bank’s \ncapital needs, culminating in the lengthy EY Capital Report on 19  March 20 17.  I have \nalready explained the new manageme nt’s reaction to th is report and  its dramatic impact \non the Bank’s financial statements in paragraphs 597 to 599 above.  \n1934.  Moving on to the second main period , the Bank submitted that t he fifth reason for why \nthe lapse of time after nationalisation did not amount to undue delay, was the Rothschild \nnegotiations , the progress of which I have  described in paragraphs  600 to 604 above.  \nThese were focussed on seeking to achieve the result to which the Individual \nDefendants had committed themselves in their 16 December 2016 letter to the Prime \nMinister  (the Nationalisation Letter) .  The Bank submitted that i t was entirely \nappropriate for its new management to seek to hold the Individual Defendants to the  \npromise s they had made .  One of the reasons for this was that a negotiated resolution \nwith the assistance of an “internationally recognised company”  was one of the IMF’s \nrequirements.   The negotiations proceeded because, in the words of the press release  \nissued at the time of Rothschild’s appointment , if a restructuring could be negotiated \n“adding more collateral  and restoring the value of problem loans given to the former \nfinal beneficiaries of [the Bank] and related persons”  it would minimise the expenses \nof the state.   Having said what they said on 16 December 2017, t he Individual \nDefendants participated in that process.  \n1935.  The Bank placed particular emphasis on this fifth reason .  It submitted that it had relied \ndirectly on the Individual Defendants ’ conduct and promises , and indeed was formally \nrequired by the IMF to en gage in negotiations in order to minimise expenses to the \nstate.  O nce those talks had collapsed, the Bank acted expeditiously in putting together \nits claim and issuing proceedings .  In my judgment, although taken alone not of itself a \nreason why the lapse of time did not amount to undue delay, on the particul ar facts of \nthis case  the Bank’s approach was both  justified and reasonable .  It weighs firmly in \nthe balance to disapply the limitation period in accordance with Article 267(5).  \n1936.  The sixth reason was the work on assessing related party lending and the New Loans.   \nAs I explained in paragraph 599 above, the Bank’s accounts signed off on  25 May 20 17 \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n468 \n wrote down the New Loans by 98% and – as Ms  Pakhachuk explained – “The position \nof these borrowers were deteriorating with every passing month, so by May we realised \nthat those were mocked borrowers” .

{"start": 1767500, "text": " \nAs I explained in paragraph 599 above, the Bank’s accounts signed off on  25 May 20 17 \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n468 \n wrote down the New Loans by 98% and – as Ms  Pakhachuk explained – “The position \nof these borrowers were deteriorating with every passing month, so by May we realised \nthat those were mocked borrowers” .  This was illustrated  by Mr Shlapak ’s 20 July 2017  \nreport to the Supervisory Board on the problems faced by the Bank .  Amongst other \nthings, it examined the interest paid on  loans to 229 related parties, approximately two -\nthirds of which by value were the New Loans.   In January 2017 , UAH 556  million  in \ninteres t was paid on loans to related parties but, by June 2017 , interest payments showed \na sharp decline  to UAH 207  million.   As to the New Loans themselves  the position was \neven more stark.  Mr Stratonov’s March 2017 report had explained that UAH 698.98 \nmillion of interest was paid in January to February 2017 , but this had declined to UAH \n17.133 million in June 2017.  \n1937.  This report also illustrated another aspect of what the Bank said amounted to the \nfirefighting required of  the Bank’s new management during this period.  It explained \nthe extent of the investigations which were being conducted  by outside a gencies, \nincluding the investigation which was still being pursued by the GPO in the light of the \nGlavcom Article.  There w ere also two other  police investigation s in relation to abuse \nof office and embezzlement by Bank officials arising out of transactions with PJSC IC \nIngosstra kh and Novofarm LLC, both of which had involved the interrogation of a \nsignificant number of Bank employees.  \n1938.  The next period commenced on 27 July 2017 and related to the instruction of Hogan \nLovells and the working up of this claim.  I have described the bare outline of what \noccurred in paragraphs 604 to 608 above.  \n1939.  The Bank started this part of its submissions by drawing attention to the fact that , at the \ntime it commenced these proceedings, it was already involved in hundreds of civil \nclaims in Ukraine concern ing matters related to those addressed in these proceedings .  \nThat gave rise to the potential for lis alibi pendens  and estoppel arguments being run as \na reason why the Bank was precluded from suing in England.   It was the Bank’s case \nthat the majority of these proceedings were brought by New Borrowers controlled by \nthe Individual Defendan ts for the sole tactical purpose of eliciting a reaction which \nmight give more substance to any such  argument s.  In its evidence in support of the \nWFO application, it was said that this suspicion was strengthened by the  discovery that \n27 fraudulent claims had been brought, purportedly on behalf of the Bank, since its \nnationalisation. They had not been authorised by the Bank and bore the forged \nsignatures of Bank employees .  The Bank relied on thi s evidence  to illustrate the \ndifficult types of jurisdictional issue with which it had to grapple before it was able to \nget these  proceedings off the ground.  \n1940.  The manner in which these proceedings were then worked up was described in the \nevidence in support of the WFO Application by Mr Richard Lewis, a partner in Hogan \nLovells.  It makes the position quite clear, and I can do no better than set out the relevant \npart of his affidavit in full:  \n“In due course and following the breakdown of the Rothschild discussions (but \nwithout waiving privilege), my firm was engaged by the Bank on 7 August 2017, \nto consider whether claims might be brought against the First and Second \nDefendants in England.

The Bank also summarised  a number of miscellaneous points which made it more than \nusually difficult to actually issue proceedings  once the decision to instruct Hogan \nLovells to make preparations to enable the Bank to do so  was made , as it was on 27 \nJuly 2017.  \n \nApplication of Article 267(5): the position of the Defendants  \n1942.  In closing submissions, M r Kolomoisky made the inevitable concession  that, while he \nwas in control of the Bank , it could not bring proceedings against him.   However, he \nalso pointed out that , although the NBU could have intervened at any time after learning \nof what was alleged in the Glavcom Article i n November 2014, it did not do so  until \nDecember 2016 , at which point, the Bank’s management were immediately replaced \nand the Individual Defendants  were no longer in control.  \n1943.  Against that background, it  was at the heart of the Defendants’ submissions that, despite \nthe suggestions to the contrary made in the witness statements  filed on behalf of th e \nBank , it could have commenced proceedings against the Defendants very shortly after \nnationalisation.  It was said that the fact that it did not do so was not because it was \n“prevented or significantly hindered” by any external circumstances, but was simply \ndue to its own choices as to how  and where  to proceed.   They  submitted that the  true \nreason why the Bank did not bring its claim at some point between January and \nNovember 2017 was that it chose first to negotiate with Mr Kolomoisky and then to \nprepare a WFO application before issuing its claim.  Both of those were choices freely \nmade by the Bank for commercial or tactical reasons and cannot possibly qualify as \n“objective reasons beyond its control”.   This was said to disable the court from appl ying \nthe jurisdiction to disapply the limitation period pursuant to Article 267(5).  \n1944.  The Defendants also submitted that it was  irrelevant that  the Bank could not bring \nproceedings before the change of  management at the end of 2016. Mr Beketov \nconfirmed that the mere fact that the  claimant is deprived of part (or even most) of the \nlimitation period in which to bring its claim was not in itself a ground for applying \nArticle 267(5).  It submitted that, while in some cases the loss of part of the limitation \nperiod might prevent a claimant from filing its claim in time, that is not what happened \nin this case, because the Bank was in a position to file its claim for many months but \nchose not to do so.  The Defendants suggested that the reason for this was that the Bank \nwanted to bring the  claim outside Ukraine and make an application for the WFO before \ndoing so.  They said that this is  not at all the type of situation that Article 267(5) \ncontemplates.  \n1945.

The facts on which the Defendants relied in support of this submission  included some \nof the matters which I have already described in the context of the Defendants’  new \ndefence that the Bank made a deliberate  post-nationalisation choice to continue to treat \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n470 \n the New Loans as outstanding and thereby accept that the Relevant Loans had been \nrepaid (see paragraphs 1096 ff above).   I will, however , revisit the same material in the \nlimitation context.  \n1946.  The focus of th e Defendants’  submission was that Mr Oleksiyenko and Ms Pakhachuk , \nwho were two of the more important members of the Bank’s new management, \nconceded that they had known about the essential elements of the Bank’s claims in \nthese proceedings since December 2016 or January 2017 and that proceedings could \nhave been commenced against the Individual Defendants  at any time thereafter.   In \nsupport of this contention,  Mr Oleksiyenko and Ms Pakhachuk were asked about the \nattitude of the Bank’s new mana gement to the commencement of legal proceedings for \nthe recovery of the Bank’s losses , in circumstances in which  the Bank’s preferred \noption  was to negotiate with the Individual Defendants for them to comply with the \nundertakings they had given in the Nationalis ation Letter . \n1947.  In that context, Mr Oleksiyenko  was asked on two occasions about the Bank’s attitude \nto proceedings against the Individual Defendants at the beginning of 2017 .  The first \nexchange took the following form : \n“Q. … If one had wanted to commence proceedings, leaving  aside the \nnationalisation, you were -- the Bank was, as  you saw it, in a position to do so but \nit didn't in the  early part of 2017 because you thought you would wait to  give the \nformer owners a chance to make good on the  nationalisation letter promises; \ncorrect?  \nA.  That's correct.  To clarify it, I was referring to  commercial litigation of a similar \nnature which is  reviewed by the court. ” \n1948.  The next exchange took place on the second day of the cross -examination and took the \nfollowing form:   \n“Q.  Is this a fair summary: you had knowledge of those  facts, you -- your position \nand that of your fellow  board members was you were aware of the terms of the  \nnationalisation letter and you thought, at the beginning  of 2017, that the former \nowners should be given the opportunity to make good on those commitments?  \nA.  Absolutely, my Lord  \nQ.  Yes.  And the expression you use is that time should be  allowed for them to \nprovide their proposals, that yo u should give them an opportunity to do that before \nyou resorted to other methods to get compensation?  \nA.  That is correct. ” \n1949.  The evidence from Ms Pakhachuk as to the potential need for legal proceedings and the \ninterrelationship with the Nationalisation Letter was in  similar terms : \n“Q.  My question is just a simple one.  In the event, if it  turned out that they did not \nhonour the commitment, it  would then be necessary to institute legal proceedings  \nin order to get compensation from them.  That's als o correct, isn't it?  \nA.  Yes, I agree.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n471 \n “Q.  Good.  Now -- and so anyone on the management board -- and I understand \nthis wasn't part of your area of  responsibility -- but those who were responsible for  \nlooking into these things, particularly Mr Shlapak, were  fully aware of the fact that \nit might well be necessary to institute legal action if the former owners did not  \nhonour their commitment; correct?  \nA.

Yes, correct. ” \n1950.  This link between the undertakings given by the Individual Defendants in the \nNationalisation Letter and the possible need for legal proceedings against the Individual \nDefendants if they did not comply was no secret .  On 20 January 2017, the VoxUkraine \nArticle was published (see paragraph 589 above)  and the views of Ms Rozhkova and \nMs Gontareva  can be garnered from the following passages :  \n“If they do not restructure the amount of loans (to related parties - UE) within six \nmonths on market conditions, they will face criminal liability for bringing the bank \nto bankruptcy,\" NBU head Valerya Gontareva says about Kolomoisky and his \npartner Gennad y Bogolyubov.  \n“By July, the former shareholders must restructure their loan portfolio.  That is, to \ndo exactly the same thing that the National Bank had previously demanded of them, \nexplains Rozhkova: transfer loans to solvent borrowers and provide collateral. If \nthese conditions are met, it is not necessary to repay loans at once: payments will \nstretch over several years. And if borrowers regularly repay loans, the bank will \ncontinue to cooperate with them.”  \n“The National Bank is confident in their decisions, especially since dozens of \nformer owners of banks, withdrawn by it from the market over the past two years, \nare already suing the regulator. And with regard to Privatbank, the head of the \nNBU, Valeria Gontareva, is determined: a refusal to restructure loans, in \naccordance with the relevant law, could lead the former shareholders of Privatbank \nto the court.”  \n1951.  The Defendants made detailed submission s as to the context in which it was necessary \nto assess the significance of t he answ ers given by Mr Oleksiyenko and Ms Pakhachuk .  \nTheir starting point was what they contended to be  the wide -ranging information that \nwas available to the NBU before nation alisation.  This was the background against \nwhich the  court should reach conclusions as to the extent and significance of the new \nmanag ement’s awareness of the elements of the available claims against the Individual \nDefendants on and shortly after their appointment.  This included what was said in the \nNBU’s 15 August 2014  audit report (see paragraph 402 above ), the Glavcom Article, \nthe NashiGroshi Articles which led to Request 27  and the several reports and \ninvestigations by the NBU between February 20 15 and  December 2016  that I  have \nsummarised earlier in this judgment .  These included  the NBU’s stress testin g \nDiagnostic Study sent to the Bank on 15 December  2015 (see paragraph 485 above)  \nand the EY Related Parties Report (see paragraph 470 above) .  It also included the \ncontinuing disagreement between the Bank a nd the NBU on the identity  of related \nparties and how many there were , and the fact that the NBU and the Ukrainian \nGovernment took steps to instruct professional advisors, including Hogan Lovells, as \nearly as the middle of July 2015.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n472 \n 1952.

For the reasons I \nhave already explained in paragraphs 495 to 499 above I do not accept that submission  \nin the terms in which it was made .  I agree that t he possibility that the Bank might have \nclaims against the Individual Defendants was in the mind of the Ukrainian authorities \nwhen these meetings were being held , although there are plenty of indications that \nlosses to the public purse through the NBU  was the focus, not claims by the Bank itself .  \nHowever, the likelihood  is that no legal analysis was done at that stage as to how  any \nclaims against the Individual Defendants might be formulated or pursued  if the Bank \nwere to be nationalised .  Furthermore, t here is no indication that any evidence was being \nconsidered at th at stage or that there was any detailed discussion about the facts  or the \nextent to which particular facts need ed to be proved in order to establish liability ; it is \nclear to me that the discussions were much more general than that.  \n1953.  The next category of pre -nationalisation information was the contents of the December \n2016 NashiGroshi Article  and at least one of the other  articles  that I have referred to in \nparagraph  589 above .  It was accepted by both Mr Oleksiyenko and Ms Pakhachuk that \nthey knew of the contents of these articles either at or about the time they were \npublished , or by Janu ary 2017 at the latest . \n1954.  The Defendants then relied  on the fact that Ms Rozhkova confirmed that “it was very \nimportant” for the new management of the Bank to be informed of the NBU’s \nconclusion that the Glavcom allegations were true and that she believed the new \nmanagement did understand the real situation because of a ll the materials that the NBU \nhad submitted to the Bank and were available for their review.   The way in which Mr \nOleksiyenko described this as happening was as follows:  \n“There was a process of on -boarding involving the Ministry of Finance and [the \nNBU ], but that was fairly limited: it consisted of a small number of presentations, \nfrom which we were not permitted to take copies of the underlying materials. We \nwere never provided with a formal briefing pack of documents, for example.”  \n1955.  In closing submissions on behalf of Mr Kolomoisky , Mr Oleksiyenko was severely \ncriticised for providing hardly any detail of these “on -boarding” briefings. He did not \naccept that it was his deliberate decision not to go into detail and explain the position \nto the court, although he accepted that he had understood that it was particularly \nimportant  for the court to know what the new management was told at the time of their  \nappointment  and confirmed that it was part of the Management Board’s responsibility \nto take such steps as were necessary on the Bank’s behalf to recover  money that had \nbeen misappropriated .  He also confirmed that it was equally material for the \nmanagement to know if the NBU had formed the conclusion that the former owners of \nthe Bank had violated the Bank’s rights, whether by procuring a misappropriation of \nthe Bank’s assets or otherwise , and that the new management had a duty to ensure that \nsteps were taken to seek compensation from them within the time limits prescribed by \nlaw. \n1956.  Mr Oleksiyenko accepted  that, in the course of the on -boarding briefings, the new \nmanagement’s attention was drawn to the NBU’s findings that the Bank’s former \nmanagement had been making decisions designed to benefit its shareholders. These \nfindings included the conclusion in the NBU’s report dated  1 July 2016 (see paragraph \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoi"}
{"start": 1785000, "text": "ken to seek compensation from them within the time limits prescribed by \nlaw. \n1956.  Mr Oleksiyenko accepted  that, in the course of the on -boarding briefings, the new \nmanagement’s attention was drawn to the NBU’s findings that the Bank’s former \nmanagement had been making decisions designed to benefit its shareholders. These \nfindings included the conclusion in the NBU’s report dated  1 July 2016 (see paragraph \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n473 \n 512 above)  that “the Bank [had been] an instrument for raising funds for lending to a \nwide range of parties related to the Bank. Most of the corporate loan portfolio is \nscheme -based and sham”.  \n1957.  The Defendants also contended that  Mr Howard  had extracted  admissions from  both \nMr Oleksiyenko and Ms Pakhachuk that the Bank knew of the violations of rights which \nwere the subject of the se proceeding s during the course of January 2017 .  This evidence \nwas relied on in the same way as the evidence I referred to earlier as to what w ere said \nto be concession s by Mr Oleksiyenko and Ms Pakhachuk that (a) they had known about \nthe essential elements of the Bank’s claims in these proceedings since December 2016 \nor January 2017 and (b) that proceedings could have been commenced against the \nIndividual Defendants at any time thereafter.  \n1958.  So far as Mr Oleksiyenko is concerned, his evidence on this issue appears from  the \nfollowing exchange, which occurred after Mr Howard had taken him through  a whole \nseries of points on what he  had and had not seen , and when he had a nd had not seen it : \n “Q.  Right.  What I'm interested in and I think where we get to is, firstly, at the \ndate when you and your colleagues come into the Bank, you are fully aware of the \nfact that the NBU has in fact itself -- we've seen what the journalists say, so we'll \nleave that on one side.  We've now got what the NBU is saying about the borrowers \nand the suppliers.  You're fully aware of the fact that the NBU is satisfied and has \ndetermined that the borrowers and suppliers, insofar as they have been listed in the \ndocument s, were related parties of the shareholders being used to transit funds on \nbehalf of the shareholders or siphon funds to them; correct?  \nA.  This is correct, but, my Lord, I would want to stress that the revelation that \nNashiGroshi article list of companies and related parties list of companies in full \nwas produced only in December 2016, not earlier.  \nQ.  Righ t. \nA.  Before that, NBU didn't have a full picture who ar e related parties to the Bank \nand if they are abusing or  not abusing.  \nQ. Right. Okay. That will do for me. So in December 2016 there is a full picture, \nas far as you were concerned, that the borrowers and the suppliers -- in relation to \nthe matters which are the subject matter of the particulars of claim, the borrowers \nand the suppliers are simply related parties who are being used to transit fun ds on \nbehalf of or to siphon funds to the shareholders; correct?  \nA. Yes.  \nQ. In other words, in the terminology that the Bank likes to use in these \nproceedings, in December 2016 you are fully aware of the fact that at least $1.82  \nbillion has been misappropriated, as you see it, or that misappropriation has been \nprocured by Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov by use of the borrower and \nsupplier companies; correct?  \nA. I agree with this. ” \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n474 \n 1959.  Ms Pakhachuk was cross -examined on a similar basis.

In fact , the passage from the \nNBU’s July 2016 audit report to which Mr Howard was referring in this line of \nquestioning (see paragraph  512 above) did not specifical ly use the phrase “ Kolomoisky \nand Bogolyubov -related parties ”, and it is plain that Ms Pakhachuk’s focus at this stage \nwas on liquidity , and not on the investigation into the Bank’s borrowing  being carried \nout by Mr Stratonov  (paragraphs 591 to 596 above).  \n1960.  Nonetheless I agree  that some of what Ms Pakhachuk had seen by then  (in particular \nthe second of the February 2015 NashiGroshi articles) included reference to Mr \nKolomoisky having siphoned off US$ 1.8 billion overseas, although it is right to note \nthat in the same article , it was being reported that Ms Gontareva had told \nLigaB usinessInform that , as at November 201 4, all she had seen w ere deposit outflows \nand that she had “no claim s against PrivatBank”.   It is also clear that much of the focus \nof the se artic les was on deficiencies in the NBU’s regulation and whether it was the \nvictim of poor and dishonest lending practices  involving the Individual Defendants,  \nbecause of the public money which had been advance d to keep the Bank afloat .  They \nwere not focussed (other than inferentially) on the possible claims that the Bank itself \nmay have had against the Individual Defendants.  \n1961.  Having gone through these events in some det ail, I can express my conclusions quite \nshortly .  I accept that this all shows that , from shortly after nationalisation, the  new \nmanagement of the Bank was aware that there were likely to be available  claim s against \nthe Individual Defendants , and that i n broad terms any such claims would be likely to \ncontain many of the allegations which are made in these proceedings.  However , it is \nalso clear that the precise extent of wh at occurred  had not yet been identified o r \nunrav elled, and it is equally clear that there  was a v ast mass of material to be gone \nthrough in order to ensure that any claim was properly formulated.  \n1962.  I also consider that it was both reasonable and consistent with the statutory test for the \nBank to concentrate on two specific issues quite apart from the process of  commencing \npreparation of the proceedings .  The first was the taking of steps to stabilise the Bank \nand the second was the efforts to do what it could to negotiate for the Individual \nDefendants to  comply with the undertakings they gave in the Nationalisation Letter.  \n1963.  As to the issue of negotiation it was said by the Defendants that this was a deliberate \nchoice made by the Bank which meant that  the statutory jurisdiction under Article \n267(5) was not engaged.  I disagree.  The decision was driven by the requirement s of \nthe IM F and the government to try to negotiate first so that expenses to the state could \nbe minimised .  I agree that this was a factor beyond the Bank’s control and significantly \nhindered the bringing of the claim during the period up to July 20 17.  I also agree that \nit is a factor which was contributed to by the Individual Defendants themselves  by \ngiving the undertakings they gave and engaging in the process of negotiation.   Even if \nthis second aspect were  not to be part of the key consideration s as defined, I consider \nthat, as with the recogn ition in Sirius -Bud that fraud  by the defendant was a relevant \nfactor for the court when considering a "}

Even if \nthis second aspect were  not to be part of the key consideration s as defined, I consider \nthat, as with the recogn ition in Sirius -Bud that fraud  by the defendant was a relevant \nfactor for the court when considering a case such as the present, any Ukrainian court \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n475 \n would regard it as a factor which strengthened the validity of the reasons for the claim \nnot being commenced in due time.  \n1964.  Mr Hunter finished his submissions on this point in reply with what can properly be \ncalled a peroration.  He said that in a case in which the Individual Defendants have \nacted in egregious bad faith, both by committing the fraud, by lying about it, by \nconce aling it and then by seeking to obstruct its proper investigation and whose \nfraudulent conduct caused the collapse of a bank of systemic importance to the \nUkrainian economy, it is inconceivable that the Ukrainian court would not do all it \ncould to ensure f ull access to justice.  I agree that th e likelihood of this response by a \nUkrainian court is supported by the authorities which impel a multi -factorial fact -based \napproach with access to justice as the founding principle.   The fact that the incoming \nmanagement had to deal with the consequences of the Individual Defendants’ conduct \nas well as investigating the claim makes it a clear case to disapply the limitation period.   \n \nLimitation: the claims against the Corporate Defendants  \n1965.  As to the claim against the Corporate Defendants  under Article 1166,  it was submitted \non their behalf in closing that the applicable limitation period (together with any issue \nas to its disapplication) is unaffected by whether limitation was or was not running or \nshould be disapplied in respect of the claims against the Individual Defendants.  It was \nsubmitted that, even if the Bank had had good reason to pursue  claim s against all \nDefendants together, the Bank could have issued a protective claim form against the \nCorporate Defendants while it continued to investigate and prepare its claims against \nthe Individual Defendants.  The fact that it failed to do so is no reason  to conclude that \nthe limitation period as against it  should be held not to have expired.  On the issue of \nwhen the limitation period started to run, I agree with that submission.  However, I \nthink that the interconnectivity of the various causes of action is capable of amounting \nto one of the circumstances to be taken into account when the court is assessing whether \nthe Bank is entitled to relief under Article 267(5).  \n1966.  The Corporate Defendants then submitted that t here were three reasons why the \ncontention that the claims  against them  under Article 1166 are time -barred is stronger \nthan the Limitation Defence available to the Individual Defendants.  \ni) The first was said to be the i dentity of the wrongdoer. It was submitted that \nascertaining who was behind the misappropriation is irrelevant to when time \nbegan to  run as against the Corporate Defendants , since their role was at all \ntimes visible .  The reason for this is that t he Unreturned  Prepayments appeared \non the face of the Bank’s transaction records and the RSAs were on the Bank’s \nfiles.   It followed that the t ime necessarily began to run for these  claims against \nthe Corporate Defendants as soon as ha rm was discovered.  \nii) The second was said to be that the running of time on the claims against the \nCorporate Defendants  does not depend upon the Bank having knowledge or  \nconstructive knowledge as to who is said to have procured their actions, but only \nas to that conduct itself.  It w"}

It was also submitted that, even on the basis that time \ndid not begin to run until the Bank had a real opportunity to bring a claim, the \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n476 \n Bank had the opportunity to bring proceedings against the Corporate Defendants \nas soon as its new management took over after nationalisation.  \niii) The third was said to be that the revisions to its Charter which effectively \ndisabled the Management Board from bringing a claim against the Individual \nDefendants  while they were on the Supervisory Board was irrelevant to \nlimitation for the claims against the Corporate Defendants, because  the revisions \nonly concerned claims against the Bank’s officers.  \n1967.  I do not accept that any of these distinguishing features have the effect for which the \nCorporate Defendants contend, and I agree with the Bank’s submission that  time did \nnot begin to run  until a reasonable period after the Bank’s nationalisation .  The only \ndifference in the analysis of the Bank’s awareness of its claims against the Corporate \nDefendants and the Bank’s awareness of its claims against the Individual Defendants \nrelates to those aspects of the cause of action which required identifica tion of the \nviolator of th e Bank’s rights and the impact of the Charter.  \n1968.  So far as the Charter is concerned, I accept the Corporate Defendants’ submission that \nit is irrelevant to the Limitation Defence available to  the Corporate Defendants, because \nthe cause of action against them is not one for  “holding the officials of the Bank’s \nmanagement bodies personally liable ” and therefore remained in the hands of the \nManagement Board.  Nonetheless, the conclusion as to the impact of the Charter on the \ninability of the Management Board to procure the Bank to commence proceedings \nagain st the Individual Defendants deals only with the arguments as to the de jure  \nentitlement of the Management Board to procure the Bank to sue.  It has no effect on \nthe de facto  ability of the Bank, controlled as it was by the Individual Defendants, to \nsue either them or the Corporate Defendants  (as entities they also controlled).  In my \nview, for the reasons I have already explained, I have little doubt that the real \nopportunity test for claims against both the Individual Defendants and the Corporate \nDefendants, would not have been satisfied.  \n1969.  The same point applies to the identity of the violator, added to which, this would still \nhave required some investigation.  The Corporate Defendants have not pleaded or \ndemonstrated any link between particular individuals whose knowledge is said to be \nattributable to the Bank and any actual or constructive knowledge of what appeared on \nthe face of the Bank’s transaction records and files .  Even if this exercise had been done \nby the Corporate Defendants (which it has not), that is not the only element of the  \nviolation of the Bank’s rights of which it was required to be sufficiently aware for time \nto start  running.  All the other reasons I have already given for explaining why time did \nnot start to run against the Individual Defendants, apart from the impact of the Charter, \nare equally applicable to the claims against the Corporate Defendants.  \n1970.

As to the claim against the Corporate Defendants in unjust enrichment, which as I have \nexplained is o nly raise d as a defence  to the extent that  the cause of  action is governed \nby Ukrainian  law, it was simply said in the Corporate Defendants’ written closing \nsubmissions that the claim was time -barred on the same grounds as the claim against \nthem in tort.  This was developed (albeit shortly) in oral submissions, when Mr \nPlewman said that all that  was required was sufficient knowledge of facts to plead a \ncase which satisfied each of the elements of Article 1212, i.e., (i) the acquisition (or \npreservation) of property, (ii) at the expense of the claimant and (iii) in the absence of \nlegal grounds for the acquisition.

I do not agree.  For the unjust enrichment claim to be time barred, it was necessary for \nthe Corporate Defendants to prove that the Bank had sufficient awareness of the facts \non which its cause of action depend ed, including most specifically those which \nsupported the Bank’s case that Relevant Loans and RSAs were void , such that the \nCorporate Defendants  received the Unreturned Prepayments without a sufficient legal \nbasis  to do so.  In my view, the  Bank’s actual (and constructive) awareness  of such facts \nwas subject to the same analysis  as the claim under Article 1166, and was insufficient \nto enable proceedings to be commenced on or before 21 December 2014 for broadly \nthe same reasons.  I also consider that any awareness by individuals did not give the \nBank a real opportunity to sue for the same reasons I have identified in relation to its \nclaims under Article 1166.  \n \nLimitation : the Cypriot Borrowers and  Prominmet  \n1972.  As I have already explain ed, the allegations made by the Bank  in respect of the Relevant \nLoans to the Cypriot  Borrowers and  Prominmet were only added to these proceedings \nby amendment with effect from the issue of a protective claim form on 14 July 2020 , \nby which time it is said by the Defendants  that the limitation period had expired .  At \nthe time permission to amend was granted , the court did not determine the issue s with \nwhich CPR 17.4 is concerned, but granted relief which had the effect of adjou rning to \nthe trial the questions of whether or not the amendments  introduced a new cause of \naction or arose out of the same or substantially the same facts as were already in issue \nat the date of the amendment s.  That relief , recorded in paragraph 2 of an order mad e \nby Nugee J on 8 September 2020  (the “Nugee Order”) , took the following form:  \n“2. Save as provided for by paragraph 3 below, for limitation purposes the \namendment s contained in the RRAPOC  (the “New Matters”) shall have effect as \nfollows:  \na.

Notwithstanding paragraph 2(b) above, the Trial Judge may conclude (as \na matter of discretion) that the amendments shall be deemed to have been \nmade on 14 July 2020.”  \n1973.  The New Matters , as defined in the Nugee  Order, all related to an expansion of the \ndefinition of Borrowers to include the Cypriot Borrowers and Prominmet.  They were \ntherefore s uch of the amendments contained in what was then the Bank’s Re-Re-\nAmended Particulars of Claim as introduced : \ni) the Cypriot Borrowers and Prominmet as Borrowers in respect of Relevant \nLoans  with a value of between US$14.5 million and US$59.5 million in relation \nto the Cypriot Borrowers and a value within the range already pleaded in relation \nto Prominmet ; \nii) averments as to the purposes for which the Relevant Loans to the Cypriot \nBorrowers and Prominmet  were made, viz., “working capital replenishment”  in \nrelation to Prominmet and  “replenishment of floating assets for payments \naccording to contracts, including for shares ” in relation to the Cypriot \nBorrowers ; and \niii) averments as to the interest rates at which and period s of time for which the \nRelevant Loans to the Cypriot Borrowers and Prominmet were to be advanced \nand the security granted in consideration for their advance . \n1974.  Unlike the Relevant Loans made to the original 46 Ukrainian Borrowers, it was not \nalleged that Prominmet or the Cypriot Borrowers executed RSAs.  However, it was \nalleged that the Relevant Loans of which each of them was a Borrower (totalling \nUS$46,023,133) caused, in part, the making of two of the Unreturned Prepayments .  \nThe details  are set out in paragraph 301 above.  \n1975.  The Corporate Defendants submitted t hat the consequence to the Bank’s claim of the \nRelevant Loans to Prominmet and the Cypriot Borrowers being time barred , would be \na reduction of US$ 46,023,133 in the Defendants’ liability under Article 1166 and also \na reduction of the same amount in Collyer ’s liability in restitution .  I should note that \nthe figures referred to in this paragraph are taken from the Particulars to the Bank’s Re -\nRe-Re-Re-Amended Particulars of Claim, itself confirmed by Mr Thompson .  I was no t \naddressed on the significance if any of the fact that the relevant Schedule to the Bank’s \nprotective claim form was in some respects different.  \n1976.  The amendments also pleaded that, as with  the other Borrowers, Prominmet and the \nCypriot Borrowers had no proper credit or trading history  and no real prospect of \nrepaying the Relevant Loans  or the inter est payments that would fall due under then .  \nThis was particularised by allegation s that the account opening documentation \nindicated the only credit history was a single loan from the Bank to Fiastra  Trading Ltd , \nthat Prominmet  carried on the types of non -specific trading activity described in \nparagraph 327 above  and that they each had only one"}

It was also \npleaded by amendment  that the Individual Defendants were  the ultimate beneficial \nowners  and control lers of Prominmet and the Cypriot Borrowers . \n1977.  In relation to the allegation that the Individual Defendants were the ultimate beneficial \nowners and controllers of Prominent, the Bank relied on the same particulars it had \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n479 \n already pleaded  in relation to the o ther Ukrainian Borrowers .  It also added an averment \nthat the (worthless) security purportedly granted in support of the Relevant Loan to \nProminme t consisted of security granted by companies ultimately owned and controlled \nby the Individual Defendants .  This was said to have taken  the form of a pledge of \ncontractual rights under RSAs  entered into by Agroprom, Inkeriya and Viglon (all of \nwhich were Ukrainian Borrowers  mentioned earlier in this judgment ) and Stalkar LLC  \nand a guarantee granted by Ingosstrakh , whic h purported to limit Ingoss trakh’s  liability \nto the Bank to UAH 10,000  (see also paragraph 105 above) . \n1978.  In relation to the allegation that the Individual Defendants were the ultimate beneficial \nowners and controllers of the Cypriot Borrowers, it was also alleged that the security \ngranted in support of the Relevant Loans consisted of security granted by companies \nultimately owned and controlled by the Individual Defendants and particulars of that \nsecurity was pleaded .  These allegation s were said to be supported by the following \nparticulars : \ni) that the business plan provided to the Bank by each of the three Cypriot \nBorrowers stated that the loan would be used for a project involving the purchase \nand resale of shares in a company ultimately owned and controlled by the \nIndividual Defendants ; \nii) that t he speed with which the loans to the three Cypriot B orrowers were granted  \nmeant that the period of time for consideration was insufficient  to enable any or \nany proper due diligence to be undertaken ; \niii) that the Bank’s records do not disclose any lending admissibility opinion or \ncredit committee presentations in relation to the Relevant Loans to the th ree \nCypriot Borrowers;  \niv) that the interest rate specified in each of the Relevant Loans was substantially \nbelow prevailing market rates ; \nv) that the Relevant Loans to the Cypriot Borrowers were purported to be repaid \nby way of loans to the Borrowers and further companies ultimately owned and \ncontrolled by the Individual Defendants , which like the repayment of other \nRelevant Loans were made for the purpose of disguising the Misappropriation \nand did not amount to legitimate lending and therefore stand to be ignored ; and \nvi) that the Relevant Loan agreement between the Bank and each of the Cypriot \nBorrowers was backdated on the instructions of the Individual Defendants, an \nallegation which is to be inferred from the fact that in each case employees of \nthe Bank requested a copy of the loan agreement, minutes of the meeting at \nwhich the  Borrower ’s directors approv ed the loan, a share pledge agreement, a \nfeasibility study and other documents from employees of Primecap two days \nafter the loan had purportedly been entered into and the funds  had been  drawn \ndown . \n1979.

At the trial, the Bank approached this issue from two separate perspective s.  First , it \nsaid that what were called the New Matters did not introduce a new cause or causes of \naction, and in any event arose  out of the same or substantially the same facts as were \nalready in issue at the date of amendment.   If this is correct, it would follow as a result \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n480 \n of paragra ph 2b of the  Nugee  Order that the allegation s relating to the Relevant L oans \nto the Cypriot  Borrowers and  Prominmet  fall into exactly the same category for \nlimitation purposes as the claims relating to the other Relevant Loans.  \n1980.  Secondly, it plead ed that , in any event  and having regard to the Ukrainian law principle \nthat the limitation period begins on the date on which a claimant acquires actual or \nconstructive knowledge of the facts on which its cause of action depends, it first \nacquired knowledge of the misappropriation of funds by the Individual Defendants in \nthe manner alleged in these proceedings  between August and December 2017.   If this  \nis correct, it would follow as a result of paragraph 2c of the Nugee Order that whether \nor not  the New Matters  introduce d a new cause of action  or arose out of the same or \nsubstantially the same facts , the Limitation Defence as it applies to the New Matters \nwould fail , because 14 July 2020 is less than three  years from the earliest date in that \nperiod . \n1981.  In its opening submissions, the Bank relied on the arguments which it had made  on the \noriginal application for  permission to amend  and they were not further supplemented \nin the Bank’s written or oral closing argum ent.  For present purposes the starting point \nis whether the proposed amendments seek to add or substitute a new claim , a phrase  \nwhich in volves for present purposes the introduction of a new cause of action  (section \n35(2)(a) of Limitation Act 1980 ).  The Bank submitted, in my view correctly, that t he \nquestion of whether amendments raise a “new claim” for the purposes of section 35 of \nthe Limitation Act 1980 and CPR 17.4 is a procedural matter determined by English \nlaw ( Tatneft  v. Bogolyubov  [2018] 4 WLR 14, per Longmore LJ at [32], [60]).  The \ncourt therefore applies the English law test as to what constitutes a new claim where \nthat claim is governed by foreign law, albeit against the backdrop and elements of the \nforeign cause of action.   In Berezovsky  v. Abramovich  [2011] 1 WLR 2290 Longmore \nLJ at [59 -61] made clear that a cause of action for these purposes comprises the essential \nfacts giving rise to a legal right and those facts must be selected at the hig hest level of \nabstraction.  It should not be over -elaborate.  \n1982.  The next question for the court is to ask whether, if the amendments involve the addition \nor substitution of a new cause of action, they arise out of the same or substantially the \nsame facts as are already in issue in the existing claim.  The answer to thi s question is \nan important and substantive question of law .  The assessment proceeds having regard \nto the fact that the underlying purpose and policy of section 35 is to prevent a defendant \nfrom having to investigate after the expiry of the limitation peri od facts and obtain \nevidence of matters which are “completely outside the ambit of ” those which would \nbe investigated in relation to the unamended claim and are unrelated to those which he \ncould reasonable be assumed to have investigated for the purpose of defending the \nunamende d claim (Ballinger"}

Mercer Ltd  [2014] EWCA Civ 996, [2014] 1 WLR 3597 \nat [34], approving a statement to that effect by Colman J in BP plc  v. Aon Ltd  [2006] 1 \nLloyd ’s Rep 549, 558 ). \n1983.  The Bank also submitted that, simply because the new claim pleads new facts is not \ndeterminat ive of w hether the new claim arises out of substantially the same facts as \nalready pleaded .  In a sense that is obvious from the language of  CPR 17.4 and is \nreflective of the underlying policy referred to in Ballinger .  The underlying policy  \ndescribed above has continued to inform the court’s approach: see e.g., the decision of \nthe Court of Appeal in Alame  v. Shell Plc  [2024] EWCA Civ 1500 and Geo-Minerals \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n481 \n GT Ltd  v. Downing  [2023] EWCA Civ 648 and Diamandis  v. Wills  [2015] EWHC 312 \n(Ch), in which Stephen Morris QC said at [79] of his judgment as follows:  \n“Furthermore, even if it can be said that those matters are outside or unrelated to \nexisting matters, I have to consider the extent to which the Defendants would be \nrequired to embark upon an extra investigation of new facts. This is a matter of \ndegree; an d when set against the scope of the matters which are already in issue in \nthe proceedings, in my judgment the extent of this further inquiry is relatively \nlimited.”  \n1984.  The Bank  submitted that , properly analysed , its primary claim relies upon a single cause \nof action in tort against the Defendants and not on different causes of action in relation \nto each of the Relevant Loans.  It relied on what M r Beketov had said in his evidence \nin support of the Bank’s without notice application for injunctive relief at the outset of \nthe proceedings to the effect that the claim in tort  arose out of  the Defendants ’ unlawful \nscheme which consisted of what he called their “interconnected cumulative unlawful \nactions, all taken with a common intent to defraud the Bank, and which caused a single, \nindivisible harm to the Bank for which the Defendants are jointly and severally liable” .  \nOne aspect of this description which no longer reflects the Bank’s case is that the  harm \nfor the purposes of Article 1166 is no longer said by the Bank to be indivisible , a point \nto which I have alluded in a number of different contexts and which is well -illustrated \nby Mr Hunter’s clea r statement  in opening that “ The essence of our case is that there \nwere 270 separate misappropriations of the Bank's money in the form of the relevant \ndrawdown.”  \n1985.  The Bank also relied on the fact that what it cha racterised as its single cause of action  \nsought compensation to the extent of  the value of the Unreturned Prepayments \n(US$1,911,877,385) , which  the Bank d id not seek to increase by way of the \namendments.  This is s aid to be apparent  from the fact that the reference to the further \nRelevant Loans to the Cypriot B orrowers and Prominmet are no more than further \nparticulars of the Bank’s existing cause s of action in tor t and unjust enrichment.   Put \nanother way, no new provisions of Ukrainian law are relied upon  and the proposed \namendments simply provide further particularisation in relation to c.US$46 million of \nthe US$ 1.911 billion claimed, explaining how the fraudulent scheme had caused the \nBank to suffer loss . \n1986.

The Bank then submitted that if it is wrong that the New Matters do not introduce a \nnew cause or causes of action, they  arise  out of the same or substantially the same fact s. \nIn support of this submission t he Bank relied on:  \ni) the common ground that there was a complicated and artificial money \ncirculation scheme operating within the Bank before its nationalisation ; \nii) its case that where , as part of this s chem e, the Relevant Loans were said to have \nbeen  repaid with  illegitimate further lending from the Bank  in the form of the \nIntermediary Loans , those purported repayments s tood to be ignored when \ndetermining both the amount remaining unpaid under the Relevant Loans and \nthe amount of the Bank’s loss for the purpose of its claim in tort; and  \niii) the Defendants ’ alleg ation  that if (contrary to their primary defences) there was \nno legitimate repayment of the Relevant Loans, the Bank h ad still  suffered no \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n482 \n loss because the monies paid under the Relevant Loans were  transferred back to \nthe Bank as part of the m oney circulation scheme  as evidenced by the Lafferty \nSpreadsheets.  \n1987.  The Bank also contended that Promin met and the Cypriot Borrowers were controlled \nby the Individual Defendants , that they had no prospect of repaying  the Relevant Loans  \nwhich were made to them and that those Relevant Loans were not the “ the subject of \nlegitimate repayment ”. \n1988.  Mr Kolomoisky  disagree d on both scores , and Mr Bogolyubov adopted Mr \nKolomoisky’s arguments.  It was submitted  on their behalf that , in his expert ’s report \nfor the trial, Mr Beketov had accepted that the Bank was the victim of a series of torts \nand that procuring each loan is a separate t ort, a point that was  reflected in the Bank’s \nopening submission s (as described above)  in which it was also said by Mr Hunter that \nits case was that the Misappropriation caused a series of direct, immediate losses to the \nBank in the form of the Relevant Drawdowns.  This was reiterated in closing when it \nwas said that the Relevant Drawdowns were misappropriations of the Bank’s money, \nwhich caused loss in the amounts which were extracted. That loss was materially \nreduced only by true repayments and the true value of the Transferred Assets.  Mr \nKolomoisky submitted  that the amendments introduced new causes of action  because \nthis way of putting the case made clear that each Relevant Drawdown was a separate \ncause of action . \n1989.  It was also submitted that the amendments could not properly be characterised as the \nBank merely producing further particularisation of a claim to US $1,911,887,385 .  This \nfigure represented the total amount of the Unreturned Prepayments, and the Bank had \nonly claimed misappropriations of money under Relevant Loans made to the original \n46 Ukrainian Borrowers who had paid those Unreturned Prepayments .  By contrast, it \nwas said that t he claims in respect of Prominmet and the Cypriot Borrowers we re made \nin resp ect of advances of money to parties who did not make Unreturned Prepayments .  \n1990.  Counsel for Mr Kolomoisky  also said that there were other significant differences from \nthe remaining 46 Ukrainian Borrowers.  It was said that the claims in respect of \nProminmet and the Cypriot Borrowers  involve d different agreements, different \nunlawful acts and (so it was said) different losses .

They  also relied on the fact that \nProminmet’s security package was different in the respects I have outlined above, that \nthe Cypriot Borrowers did not enter into RSAs  with the Corporate Defendants  and did \nnot make  any Unreturned Prepayments directly to them, be cause it was the Bank’s case \nthat their Relevant Loans only funded Unreturned Prepayments indirectly  as described \nin paragraph 1974  above.   Prominmet and the Cypriot Borrowers  did not appear as what \nwere called Residents on the Kazantsev Spreadsheet  or Customers on the Gurieva \nSpreadsheet.  \n1991.  There is no doubt that this list of  differences between the position of the Cypriot \nBorrowers and Prominmet on the one hand and the position of the original 46 Borrowers \non the other  is material  in some important respects .  However, the compensation to the \nextent of  the value of the Unreturned Prepayments (US$1,911,877,385) remains the \nsame  and the Relevant Loans to Prominmet and the Cypriot Borrowers arise in relation \nto the same loan recycling scheme .  They are all intimately interconnected in their \nimpac t on the Bank with the Relevant Loans to the original 46 Borrowers.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n483 \n 1992.  In these circumstances, while I think that in the light of the way the Bank puts its case , \nthe better view is that the amendments plead additional causes of action , the right way \nof characterising the f urther Relevant Loans to the Cypriot B orrowers and Prominmet \nis that they amount to additional tortious acts causing harm to the Bank , but for which \nthe same compensation is payable .  So far as the claims in unjust enrichment are \nconcerned , the amounts by which the Corporate Defendants were enriched remains \nunchanged ; the effect of the amendments is further to particularise the insufficiency of \nthe legal grounds on which the enrichment was acquired.    \n1993.  Having regard to the guidance in the authorities I have cited, the amendments have not \nrequired the Defendants to investigate facts and obtain evidence of matters which are \ncompletely outside the ambit of those required to be investigated in relation to th e \nunamended claim.  In my view, when set against the scope of the matters which are \nalready in issue in the proceedings, the extent of th e further inquir ies required were \nrelatively limited . \n1994.  In my judgment , the amendments arise out of substantially the same facts as were \nalready in issue before the New Matters were sought to be included in the proceedings \nby amendment. I did not understand any party to contend that, notwithstanding this \nconclusion, the discretion granted by clause 2d of the Nugee Order should be exercised \nand, in any event, I can see no basis on which it would be appropriate for me to do so.  \nIt therefore  follows that  the amendments shall be deemed to date from the issue of the  \nclaim form, namely 21 December 2017 . \n \nForeign Limitation Periods Act 1984 and Article 26 of Rome II  \n1995.  By way of postscript, I should briefly explain my conclusions on one of the argument s, \nwhich in the light of my earlier findings on the Limitation  Defence does not arise.   The \nBank pleaded, and addressed in both its opening and its closing written submissions \n(albeit shortly), a further juridical basis for disapplying the limitation period under \nArticle 257 and Article 261.

The \nBank pleaded, and addressed in both its opening and its closing written submissions \n(albeit shortly), a further juridical basis for disapplying the limitation period under \nArticle 257 and Article 261.  It relied on section 2(1) of the 1984 Act and/or Article 26 \nof Rome II in support of an argument that, if the three year limitation period expired \nbefore 19 December 2017, the period should be disapplied and/or extended . This \nsubmission was not developed in oral argument, but it was addressed in the closing \nsubmissions  of Mr Kolomoisky and the Corporate Defendants , and also orally by Mr \nHoward , who described it as “beyond surprising” and “utterly hopeless”.   \n1996.  The starting point for this argument is section 1 of the 1984 Act, which provides that, \nwhere the law of a foreign country falls to be taken into account in the determination of \nany matter , the law of that other country relating to limitation shall apply in respect of \nthat matter for the purposes of the action or proceedings .  The relevant exception is \ncontained in section 2(1), which provides that section 1 shall not apply, if the \napplication of the foreign limitation period conflicts with and/or is manife stly \nincompatible with public policy.  Section 2(2) then provides that there will be a conflict \nwith public policy where the application of a foreign limitation period would cause \nundue hardship to a person who is, or might be made, a party to the action or \nproceedings . \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n484 \n 1997.  The Bank then submitted that, while it accepts that a three -year limitation period is not \nitself incompatible with English public policy, and that, without more, a limitation \nperiod of this length would not cause undue hardship, that is not the case if Ukr ainian \nlaw were to permit time to run during the period when the Bank was under the control \nof the Individual Defendants.  This would be the case if it were to have failed both on \nits case as to awareness for the purposes of Article 261, and most particula rly its \nargument as to attribution of knowledge , and on its argument for disapplication under \nArticle 26 7(5).  It said that , in that eventuality, the fact that  it stood no realistic prospect \nof bringing claims against the Individual Defendants during the course of the period  for \nwhich time was running would be manifestly incompatible with English public policy.  \n1998.  The Defendants’ answer to this  submission  was that  English law recognises that \ndifferent states may reasonably make different rules in relation to limitation and that \nthe mere fact that a foreign limitation rule is stricter than the corresponding English rule \ncomes nowhere near establishing a violation of public policy. They relied on the \njudgment of Leggatt J in Alseran  v. Ministry of Defence  [2017] EWHC 3289 (QB) , \n[2019] Q B 1251 at [827]:  \n“Private international law is founded on principles of comity and mutual respect \nand on the recognition that in many areas of law different approaches may be \nreasonably taken. That is obviously true in the field of limitation law, which \ninvolves striking a balance between allowing claimants to assert their legal rights \nand protecting defendants against stale claims. Different legal systems may \nlegitimately strike this balance in different ways. An English co urt should for this \nreason be very slow to substitute its own view for the solution adopted by the \nforeign legislature.  \n1999.  In Begum (on behalf of Mollah)  v.

Article 26 provides that: “[t]he application of \na provision of the law of any country specified by this Regulation may be refused only \nif such application is manifestly incompatible with the public policy (ordre public) of \nthe forum”.  In Begum , Coulson LJ then went on to explain (at [113]):  \n“As Wilkie J noted in [ KXL v. Murphy  [2016] EWHC 3102 (QB) ] public policy \nshould be invoked for the purposes of disapplying a foreign limitation period only \nin exceptional circumstances.   That could only be where the foreign limitation \nperiod was contrary to a fundamental principle of justice. That is, deliberately, set \nas a very high bar. Mr Bright rightly drew attention to the words of art 26, which \nsaid it ‘only’ applied if the foreign l imitation period was ‘manifestly incompatible’ \nwith public policy.”  \n2000.  It was then submitted on behalf of Mr Kolomoisky that there is nothing harsh about the \nUkrainian rules of limitation which apply in this case. A three -year limitation period is \nunremarkable and any potential harshness is mitigated by the existence of a discretion \nto disapply the limitation period under Article 267(5) if the claimant is prevented or \nsignificantly hindered from filing its claim in time by factors beyond its control.   It was \nsaid that this would be  a perfectly fair and balanced scheme, and can not seriously be \ncontended to raise any public policy concerns , and that it was impossible to see how \nthe court c ould conclude that English public policy is offended if it has also concluded \nthat there is no basis on which to disapply the limitation period under Article 267(5) .  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n485 \n The reason for this is that the facts on which  Mr Kolomoisky  relies in relation to Article \n267(5) also answer any case based on public policy.  \n2001.  This would have been a short point, the answer to which depends on two interlinked \nquestions both of which arise out of the law of Ukraine relating to limitation within the \nmeaning of section 1(1)(a) of the 1984 Act.  The first is whether the Ukrainian law rules \nof attribution  permit time to run during the period when the Bank was under the control \nof the Individual Defendants, and had no real opportunity to sue either them or the \ncorporate vehicles which they controlled.  The second is whether it is manife stly \nincompatible with English public policy for the Bank to be obliged to satisfy the \nrequirements of Article 267(5) as a condition for the disapplication of the three year \nperiod.  \n2002.  In light of the conclusions I have reached in relation to attribution of knowledge as a \nmatter of Ukrainian law and the impact of those principles on the facts of this case, \nthere is no need for me to reach a conclusion on whether, if I had reached another  view, \nEnglish principles of public policy would have been engaged.  However, if I had not \nreached that view, and if the Bank was unable to satisfy the requirements of Article \n267(5), I accept that there are difficulties in conclud ing that the test explain ed by \nCoulson LJ in Begum  had been satisfied.   It is likely that, g iven the Ukrainian law \nevidence, and the way in which the Ukrainian courts approach the grant of relief under \nArticle 267(5), the failure of the Bank to satisfy the disapplication test would simply \nreflect a legitimate strik ing of the  balance in  a different way  from that struck in English \nlaw. \n \nCurrency of the Bank’s claim  \n2003.

In the opening submissions of both the Bank and Mr Kolomoisky,  there was a \ndisagreement as to whether the  law applicable to the determination of the appropriate \ncurrency is a matter for the lex causae  or the  lex fori .  In light of the nature of such \ndifferences as there are in the approach adopted in English law and Ukrainian law, Mr \nKolomoisky’s closing submission s described this as a sterile debate .  I agree that there \nare in fact no differences in substance but , whe ther or not the distinction matters, it  is \nappropriate to record that  I shall follow   the view expressed in  Dicey (at para 34-059) \nthat whether Article 15(c) or 15(d) of Rome II is engaged,  the lex causae  applies to \n“cover questions concerning the currency of any damages award and the court’s powers \nto award interest”.   I shall therefore apply  Ukrainian law to questions relating to the \nappropriate currency in which the Bank’s claim for compensation is to be denominated.  \n2004.  It was not disputed that, a s a matter of Ukrainian law, a claim in tort can be expressed \nin a foreign currency, and that the Ukrainian courts  will have regard to what Mr Beketov \nsaid was the principle of “full compensation” in order t o “assess whether damages  \nawarded in currency A or currency B would be most effective in compensating the \nclaimant in full for the  harm caused”.   In my view the evidence shows that t his is very \nsimilar to the English law concept that the appropriate currency is the one in which  a \nclaimant has felt its loss.  \n2005.  Initially the Defendants contended that the Bank felt any loss in the currency in which \nits financial statements were presented, (i.e. UAH) or indeed the currency which Mr \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n486 \n Kolomoisky’s  opening submissions called the IFRS functional currency being “the \ncurrency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates”  (also \nUAH).   This was said to be substantiated by  Mr Davidson’s suggestion that the Bank \nhad only “relatively minor” exposure to US$ liabilities or currency risk.  \n2006.  As Mr Thompson explained,  the difficulty with this argument was that the Bank’s assets \nand liabilities were denominated in US$, UAH and other currencies, but were simply \nconverted to UAH at the prevailing exchange rate at the end of the accounting period \nfor the purpose of presentin g its accounts. It was therefore his evidence  that the Bank’s \nfinancial statements do not imply that the risk associated with US$ lending was carried \nin UAH . \n2007.  There was a great deal of evidence on this point, but in the end Mr Davidson changed \nhis position and accepted in cross -examination that “the only sensible way of \ncalculating loss on the dollar loans is in dollars”. Although this was not clear until \nservic e of Mr Kolomoisky’s closing submissions, this is now accepted by the \nDefendants, because Mr Kolomoisky accepted that the court should find that any loss \nwas suffered by the Bank in the currency of each Relevant Drawdown, a position said \nto reflect the Ban k’s case that it suffered 270 separate losses, at the precise moment \neach Relevant Drawdown was credited to the Borrower’s accounts.  For the purposes \nof the Bank’s claims in tort under Article  1166, the other Defendants either said that \nthey relied on Mr Kolomoisky’s submissions on the applicable currency of the Bank’s \nloss, or that they had no independent position to maintain.  \n2008.

In my view this change of position was i nevitable, because the fact that the New Loans \nwere denominated in UAH and impaired in UAH in the Bank’s 2016 financial \nstatements does not mean the Bank suffered a loss in UAH at the time of the Relevant \nDrawdowns  (a point which was part of Mr Kolomoisky’s original pleaded case) .  The \nBank does not claim for losses arising from the New Loans – its claim is for full \ncompensation for the harm it was  caused by the Relevant  Drawdowns. I agree that t he \ncurrency of the New  Loans and the subsequent impairments recorded in the Bank’s \nfinancial statements is irrelevant to  the determination of the currency in which the Bank \nsuffered  the harm  in respect of which it sues.   \n2009.  Turning then to the currency of the Relevant Drawdowns, t he Bank’s position wa s that, \nalthough that was the correct starting point, its entitlement to  full compensatio n meant \nthat its claim was one for a US$ loss, whether the currency of the Relevant Drawd own \nwas US$ or UAH .  It relied on the fact that , where a Relevant Drawdown w as made in \nUS$ (as to which the figure was US$1.5 billion) and w as not validly repaid , it is clear \nthat the Bank suffered a direct loss in US$.   It then said that  the position was the same  \nwhere a Relevant Drawdown was made in UAH  (as to which the figure was UAH 8.8 \nbillion) .  The reason for this was that, in those cases,  the UAH Relevant D rawdown was \nimmediately converted into US$ , using the exchange rate applicable on the date of \ndrawdown, so that the Borrowers could then make US$ payments out to the Corporate \nDefendants under the RSAs as part of the cycle of prepayments and returns of \nprepayment s, all of which took place in US $.  The Bank then submitted that t he effect \nof the conversion was that the Bank suffered a US$ loss , quantified as the US$ value \nof the UAH Relevant Drawdowns . \n2010.  The effect of Mr Kolomoisky’s change of approach was therefore that the only point of \nsubstance which remained outstanding on the currency issue was the right currency for \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n487 \n assessing the compensation to which the Bank was entitled in respect of the UAH \nRelevant Drawdowns.  The Bank submitted that the working through of the conversion \nprocess meant that a combination of the UAH Relevant Drawdowns and their \nimmediate conversion into US $ was used as a temporary substitute or proxy for US$ \nRelevant Drawdowns. What occurred was said to underline the fact that this was a \ncurrency fraud directed at the extraction of US$ from Ukraine, a process which \ncontinued uninterrupted when it wa s no longer possible to extract US$ from the Bank \nusing US$ -denominated Relevant Loans.  \n2011.  The way i n which the conversion process  worked was as follows.  T he Bank advanced \na UAH Relevant Drawdown to a Borrower , the Borrower sold its UAH to the Bank , the \nBank used the UAH to purchase US $ on the Interbank Foreign Exchange Market of \nUkraine  and the Bank then transferred  the US$ to the Borrower which used the US$  to \nmake a prepayment.   This was evidenced by, amongst other things , the Bank’s \ntransactional data , which show ed the Borrowers using the UAH Relevant Drawdowns \nfor the “purchase of foreign currency ”.  The evidence was that the UAH Relevant \nDrawdowns were converted to US$ through 193 sales of UAH of w hich 142 ( being \n74% by number and 93% by value) occurred"}

It was submitted on behalf of Mr Kolomoisky that this argument suffered f rom two fatal \nflaws .  The first was that steps taken by the Borrowers after  the making of the Relevant  \nDrawdown could not  affect the nature and quantification of the Bank’s loss at the \nmoment of advancing the funds drawn down .  The second was that currency exchange \ntransactions entered into by the Bank on behalf of Borrowers were transactions for \nvalue , under which  the Bank  debited UAH from the Borrower’s account, and credited \nit with a corresponding amount  of US $, which it had bought for the Borrower on the \nInterbank Exchange Market.   It was therefore incorrect for the Bank to contend, as it \ndid through Mr Thompson’s initial evidence , that, where it exchanged UAH Relevant \nDrawdowns for US$ at the request of the Borrower, the result was that the Bank’s “net \nposition” at the end of the day was that it had paid out sums of US$.   This was said to \nbe supported by Mr Thompson’s evidence in cross -examination that the net position \nanalysis did not stand up to scrutiny and that the correct position was that the Bank had \n‘lost’ UAH, rather than US$ .  In short, it was said that , in the absence of the net position \nanalysis, the currency conversions were separate transactions to the Relevant \nDrawdowns, and did not affect the currency (or indeed the amount) of the Bank’s loss.  \n2013.  The Bank also relied on the fact that the sham documentation created for the purpose \nof the Misappropriation gave  the impression that the Bank would be able to recover the \nUAH Relevant Drawdowns from the Borrowers at their US$ value on the date of \ndrawdown , because the  UAH Relevant Loans contained a provision to pay what was \nvariously called a loan commitment  or index commission  fee which was calculated so \nas to cover any decline in the value of UAH against US$, a factor which was reflected \nin the computati ons in the Gurieva Spreadsheet .  This was but one illustration of the \nfact that it was a fundamental feature of the Misappropriation that it was designed to \nmisappropriate US$, whether the original drawdown was in US$ or UAH.  \n2014.  It followed that , although  the Borrowers’ primary obligation under a UAH Relevant \nLoan was to return the UAH sum in that currency, the inclusion of the index \ncommission  fee was, a s Mr Davidson accepted , an embedded “protection for the Bank \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n488 \n that ensures that it gets back […] what would be an equivalent amount in dollars” , \nwhich itself had the effect of adjusting  what the Borrower had to repay from UAH to \nUS$.  In his closing submissions Mr Hunter said that this meant that they were , anyway \nosten sibly  “synthetic dollar loans” .  Mr Davidson also agreed that  the fee “represents \nthe difference between the value of capital and interest payments in [UAH]  and what \nwould have been paid if the loan had been denominated in [US$] ” and that it could be \nthat the need to proceed  in this way  was because the Bank wanted to hedge its foreign \ncurrency risk associated with the UAH Relevant Drawdowns , being a risk which would \narise if they were being funded by the Bank’s US $ reserve"}

What this meant from the Bank’s perspective was that, for capital and interest purposes,  \nthe UAH Relevant Loans, a lthough expressed in UAH  follow t he US$.  As Mr Hunter \nsubmitted, the Bank was a retail  bank which need ed to keep a broad equilibrium \nbetween what it borrow ed either in  the form of deposits or on the money markets, and \nwhat  it paid out in the form of lending.   It also needed to keep an equilibrium in respect \nof its reserves and its hedging for foreign exchange risks.   It followed that  (for so lo ng \nas it appear ed to be a genuine loan ) a purported loan with an  embedded derivative which \nmade it behave exactly like  a US$  loan, will or certainly should have been managed as \npart of the Bank’s  US$ loan book , not its UAH loan book , because any such loan will \nhave behave d in all respects like a US$ loan .  In particular, the value will  go up when \nthe US$ goes up  and go down when the US$ goes down.  \n2016.  One issued raised on behalf of Mr Kolomoisky  in respons e to the Bank’s case  was that  \nthe Bank has not sought to recover its loss as a matter of contract because it asserts that \nthe Relevant Loans are all void which means that  it cannot rely on the terms of the  void \nRelevant Loans  for this purpose .  The Bank’s answer to what appear ed at first blush to \nbe an attractive point is that the indexation fees are relevant , not because the Bank has \nclaimed to recover them,  but because they show that it was an integra l part of the \npurpose s for which the UAH Relevant Drawdowns  were made that they would be \nconverted into US $ immediately as part of the currency fraud  and that , if the Borrower \nmade any  repayment to the Bank, it would be for the  US$ equivalent value of the UAH \ndrawn  down . \n2017.  Another point which was made in Mr Howard’s oral  closing  submissions was  that the \nrelevant footnote in the Bank’s 2014 financia l statem ents provided that “ Fair value of \noption derivative embedded in loans and advances to customers (refer to Note 30) was \nincluded in the table above together with host instruments into UAH denominated \nfinancial assets. ”  This was said to be a reference to the line in the table which gave the \nUAH figure for foreign currency exchange risk at the end of the reporting period , which \nmeant that the embedded derivative option was still being accounted for in UAH assets.  \n2018.  At first blush this appeared to be a new point unsupported by any evidence to confirm \nthat Mr Howard’s suppositions were well founded.  However, in his submissions in \nreply, Mr Hunter addressed the point head on and said that in fact it supported the \nBank’s case rather than undermin ed it.  He said that w hat th e note reflect ed was that the \nembedded derivatives are included at  mark -to-market fair value, recorded in the table  \nwith a value  in UAH.  It is then necessary to look at two other notes to the financia l \nstatements ( notes 4 and  30), which further explain and confirm that the Bank was \ntreating the embedded derivatives as a hedge against adverse movements of the UAH \nagainst the US$.  \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n489 \n 2019.

He then said that when the Bank was induced to pay out as part of the Misappropriation, \nit was simultaneously induced  into thinking that those purported  UAH  loans were \ncurrency -hedged to the US$ and that was false  because there  was in fact no hedging.  \nSo in the circumstances of the Misappropriation , what was taken from the Bank was \nnot just UAH 8 .8 billion ; given the manner i n which it was done the Bank  was \nsimultaneously induced to think that it had UAH 8.8 billion of UAH  assets  hedged to \nthe US$ when that was not in fact the case .  If that had not happened, the Bank would \nhave found an equivalent way to hedge that UAH 8.8 billion risk, either by buying US$ \nor by utilising some other mechanism to create the same effect.  For these reasons, it is \nright to regard the Bank's loss as fel t in dollars even in respect of UAH drawdowns.  \n2020.  I prefer the Bank’s submissions on these points.  The Defendants’ case depends on \ndrawing an artificial distinction between the actual making of the Relevant Drawdown \nand a central element of the purpose for which it was made, i.e., a scheme which \nrequired  an immediate transfer of US$ out of Ukraine.  This purpose was confirmed by \nthe terms of the Relevant Drawdowns and most particularly the provisions for the \nindexation fee.  Until the Russian invasion of Crimea this central purpose was achieved \nthrough th e Relevant Drawdown itself being effected in US$.  Thereafter, it was \nsometime s necessary for the Relevant Drawdown to be in UAH followed by an \nimmediate conversion into US$, which was effected by the Bank, albeit through market \ntransaction s rather than through the use of its own foreign currency reserves , a process \nwhich was  confirmed by the notes to the Bank’s financial statements.  When that was \nrequired, it did not affect the fact that the process was all part of a single transaction for \nthe transfer ab road of US$.  I am satisfied that for the Bank to obtain full compensation \nfor the harm it sustained, its claim is properly one made in US$ for the full amount of \nits loss.  \n2021.  It was also submitted on behalf of Mr Kolomoisky , based on the evidence of Mr \nDavidson , that any credit for (valid) repayment should be calculated by reference to the \nexchange rate at the date of the Relevant Drawdowns rather than the date of repayment.  \nAs to t hat, the Bank’s  pleaded  position is that, where Transferred Assets were valued \nin UAH ( which was the position with all of the Transferred Assets other than the \nAircraft), the true value of those  assets should be converted from UAH to US$ using \nthe exchange rate applicable at the time of transfer to the Bank in 2016 .  It was \nsubmitted that this a pproach is consistent with what actually happened in relation to \nrepayment of the US$ Relevant Drawdowns because t he Bank’s transaction data shows \nthat where a US $ Relevant Dr awdown was repaid with a UAH -denominated asset, the \nvalue of the asset was converted from UAH to US $ at the exchange rate on the date of \nrepayment before being applied to reduce the outstanding balance  on the Relevant \nLoan .  It was said that converting the value of UAH -denominated assets at the 2013 -14 \nexchange rate, rather than at the  depreciated 2016 exchange rate, would prevent the \nBank from being fully compensated for its loss, because the assets were, by 2016, worth \napproximately three times less in USD terms).   In my judgment, the  Bank is correct on \nthis point for the reasons it has given . \n2022.  A similar point was argued by  the Corporate Defendants .

It was argued that the Bank  \nasserted claims against them in the US $ amounts of the Unreturned Prepayments each  \nof them  received, notwithstanding that some of the Relevant Drawdowns provided by \nthe Bank , which are said to have caused those Unreturned Prepayments , were in UAH .  \nIt was then said that, o wing to currency fluctuations, there is now a significant \nApproved Judgment  \nMr Justice Trower  JSC Commercial Bank Privatbank -v-Kolomoisky  and others  \n \n490 \n difference in value in US $ terms between the US$ amounts received by the Corporate \nDefendants  and the UAH amounts the Bank transferred away  on the making of the \nRelevant Drawdowns . Mr Plewman called this the “Dollar Differential ” and said that it \naffects the English Defendants and Milbert,  with an aggregate effect of a windfall to \nthe Bank of c.US $521 million  if the Corporate Defendants are ordered to pay the Dollar \nDifferential to the Bank.   The Corporate Defendants said that this gave rise to a complex \npoint, which related to the extent to which the Corporate Defendants’ gain is properly \nto be regarded at being at the expense of the Bank (and therefore unjust enrichment for \nwhich the Bank ca n claim).  \n2023.  In light of the nature of the conversion process, the fact that conversion into US$ was \nall part of the recycling scheme in the first place and the fact that the conversion \noccurred so immediately  after the Relevant Drawdown in all but a handful of cases , I \ndo not agree that the Dollar Differential discloses the mismatch described by the \nCorporate Defendant s.  Although some of the Relevant Drawdowns were made in \nUAH, they were immediately converted to US$ as a central element of the purpose for \nwhich they were made in the first place.  For that reason it cannot be said that the Bank  \nwill have obtained a windfall from what occurred if the Corporate Defendants are \nordered to pay any part of what they called the Dollar Differential to the Bank .   \n \nDisposition   \n2024.  The consequence s of my conclusions  are as follows : \ni) The Repayment Defence and the Limitation Defence both fail . \nii) The Individual De fendants are both jointly and se verally liable to the B ank for \ncompensation for the harm it sustained on the making of the Relevant \nDrawdowns ; the figure is to be quantified as US$1,911,877,385 les s the real \nvalue of the Transferred Assets  as reflected in the body of the judgment.  \niii) The Corporate Defendants are jointly and severally liable to the Bank for \ncompensation for the harm it sustained on the making of specific identified \nRelevant Drawdowns, but only to the extent I have identified in paragraph 1571  \nof this judgment ; if the parties are unable to agree on the extent of the \nconsequential liability, the matter can be restored for determination at a further \nhearing.  \niv) The Corporate Defendants are liable to the Bank in unjust enrichment but only \nto the extent I have identified in paragraph 1688  of this judgment; if the parties \nare unable to agree on the extent of the consequential liability, this matter too \ncan be restored for determination at a further hearing.  \n2025.  I did not hear submissions on interest during the course of oral closings , although the \nBank had produced written arg uments on their claim for both compound and simple \ninterest in the event that they were to succeed.
