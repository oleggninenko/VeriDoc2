In this \nsection, I summarise my understanding of t he relevant background insofar as it is \nrelevant to my instructions.   \n1.1.2  JSC Commercial Bank PrivatBank (“ Bank ”) alleges that, between April 2013 and \nSeptember 2014, Igor Valeryevich Kolomoisky (“ Mr Kolomoisky ”, “First Defendant ” and \n“D1”) and Gennadiy Borisovich Bogolyubov (“ Mr Bogolyubov ”, “Second Defendant ” \nand “ D2”) misappropriated approximately USD 1.9 billion from the Bank (the \n“Misappropriation ”).1  Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Bogolyubov were, together, majority \nshareholders of the Bank between at le ast 31 December 2010 and 18 December 2016, \nwhen the Bank was declared insolvent by the National Bank of Ukraine (“ NBU ”) and \nnationalised.2 \n1.1.3  Along with the First Defendant and Second Defendant, the other defendants are \nTeamtrend Limited, Trade Point Agro Limite d, Collyer Limited, Rossyn Investing Corp, \nMilbert Ventures Inc, and Zao Ukrtransitservice Ltd (“ Third to Eighth Defendants ” and, \ntogether with D1 and D2, the “ Defendants ”).  The Bank alleges that the Third to Eighth \nDefendants were each ultimately owned or controlled by Messrs Kolomoisky and \nBogolyubov and acted as recipients of monies transferred pursuant to the \nMisappropriation. \n1.1.4  The Misappropriation allegedly involved a series of loans (“ Relevant Loans ”) to 47 \nUkrainian borrowers and th ree Cypriot borrowers (“ Borrowers ”).3  It is alleged that the \nBorrowers were ultimately owned and/or controlled by Mr Kolomoisky and Mr \nBogolyubov.4  The Bank further alleges that t here has been no genuine repayment of \nprincipal or interest in relation to the Relevant Loans.5 \n1.1.5  Mr Kolomoisky maintains that, with tw o exceptions, the Relevant Loans were: \n(a) Repaid by a combination of: \n(i) Repayments in cash between September 2014 and February 2016; \n(ii) The transfer of certain assets (“ Transferred Assets ”) to the Bank between \nMarch and September 2016 (“ Asset Transfer ”); and \n(iii) The proceeds of loans made by the Bank at the direction of the NBU to 36 \nnew borrowers.6 \n \n1  Re-Re-Amended Particulars of Claim, paragraph 5. \n2  Re-Re-Amended Particulars of  Claim, paragraphs 2 to 5. \n3  Re-Re-Amended Particulars of Claim, paragraph 16. \n4  Re-Re-Amended Particulars of Claim, paragraph 19. \n5  Re-Re-Amended Particulars of Claim, paragraphs 18(c)(iii) and 18A(b). \n6  Re-Amended Defence, paragraph 15. \nD9/1/6\n  BL-2017-000665 \n   Expert Report of Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  26 January 2022 \n \nConfidential   2  \n \n(b) In any case, secured by pledges over shares in various companies (“ Share \nPledges ”).7 \n1.1.6  Regarding the amounts allegedly repaid in cash and using the proceeds of further loans \nmade by the Bank, the Bank denies that t he Relevant Loans have been the subject of \ngenuine repayment by way of cash repayments;  alternatively, the Bank alleges that any \ncash repayments made were made using funds derived from further il"}

Mr Be zant has prepared a report for this \nmatter dated 24 November 2021 (“ Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report ”).  Mr \nBezant was instructed to provide his opinio n on the market value of the shareholdings \npledged in 28 pledges that t he First Defendant relied on in his Re-Re-Amended Defence \n(“D1 RRAD ”) and Schedule 6 to D1 RRAD, which purportedly pledge shares in 21 \ncompanies (“ 28 Share Pledges ”).13   \n1.2.2  Mr Bezant assumes only signed versions of  amendments and terminations of the 28 \nShare Pledges were effective.14  Mr Bezant was instructed to: \n \n7  Re-Amended Defence, paragraphs 17 and 18. \n8  Re-Amended Reply, paragraph 27. \n9  Re-Amended Reply, paragraph 28K.3. \n10  Re-Amended Reply, paragraphs 7 and 7A(7.5). \n11  Re-Amended Reply, paragraph 7.4. \n12  Re-Amended Reply, paragraph 7.3. \n13  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, paragr aph 1.14.

The exceptions to this were that he was instructed to value Mawex \nLLC (“ Mawex ”) at 19 August 2016 and Autorembitservis LLC \n(“Autorembitservis ”) at 30 September 2015 because their respective pledges \nwere established and terminated wi thin a single calendar year;  \n(b) Value the pledged shareholdings on a standalone basis;  \n(c) Adopt the definition of market value provided in  the 2013 edition of the \nInternational Valuation Standards at t he valuation dates he was instructed to \nadopt.  These standards define market value as: “ the estimated amount for which \nan asset or liability should exchan ge on the valuation date between a willing \nbuyer and a willing seller in an arm’s lengt h transaction, after proper marketing \nand where the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without \ncompulsion ”; and \n(d) Comment on the values contained in t he 28 Share Pledges, as compared to his \nown valuations.15 \n1.2.3  In order to value the shareholdings pled ged in the 28 Share Pledges, Mr Bezant \nperforms two steps: \n(a) He calculates the value of 100% of the shares in the 21 comp anies whose shares \nwere pledged; and \n(b) He calculates the value of each pledged shareholding in the 28 Share Pledges by \nmultiplying the value calculated in st ep 1 by the relevant share"}

I am a Managing Di rector in the London practice of Secretariat \nInternational UK Ltd (“ Secretariat ”).  Headquartered in Atlanta, USA, Secretariat \nprovides financial and economic consulting ex pertise in international arbitrations and \ncommercial litigation.  I have specialised in  business valuations and forensic accounting \nfor over 20 years.  I have been appointed as  a valuation expert in a range of contexts \nand across different industries, including as an expert in the English High Court and \narbitrations under a variety of institutiona l rules, including ICSID, LCIA, ICC, SIAC, \nHKIAC, UNCITRAL and SCC.  I have previo usly undertaken seve ral business and share \nvaluations of companies operating in Ukraine and the CIS region generally.   \n1.4.2  I am a Fellow of Chartered Accountants Australia & New Zealand and a member of the \nRoyal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.  My curriculum vitae is included as Appendix 1 \nto this report. \n1.5 Other statements \n Conflicts of interest  \n1.5.1  I confirm that I am aware of no issue that would constitute a conflict of  interest or detract \nfrom me providing a wholly independent opinion in relation to this matter.  I further confirm that I am independent from the Part ies, their legal advisors and the Court. \n Information relied upon \n1.5.2  Appendix 2 contains a summary of the sources of information upon which I have relied \nin preparing this report.  If, subsequent to the issuance of this report, witness statements \nand/or further documentary or other evidence is made available, I reserve the right to \nupdate my conclusions accordingly. \n \n31  The dates of the termination agreements vary but tend to fall towards the end of October 2016.  \nFor example, Dniproazot’s shar e pledge was terminated on 25 October 2016 while Clendon’s \nshare pledge was terminated on 21 October 2016.

I do not read or speak these \nlanguages.  I have therefore relied upon mach ine translations and translations provided \nto me by Fieldfisher and Secretariat sta ff (who read and speak Russian, Ukrainian and \nPolish).   \n Information deficiencies \n1.5.5  In his First Share Pledges Report, Mr Bezant notes that, “[t] he information in disclosure \nabout most of the companies whose shar es were pledged is (very) limited ” and despite \nthe large volume of disclosed documents in this matter, “… there are significant \ndeficiencies in the information available …meaning that  [Mr Bezant’s] valuations are \nnecessarily subject to uncertainty ”32.   \n1.5.6  In order to undertake a robust valuation exercise for each of the relevant companies, I \nwould typically expect to be provided with, inter alia : \n(a) Group structure chart; \n(b) 3-5 years of historical (preferably audi ted) consolidated financial statements, \nincluding details of exceptional and non-recurring items of income and \nexpenditure; \n(c) Year to date management accounts with  actual versus budget performance \nanalysis; \n(d) Details of any over-reliance on certain customers or suppliers; \n(e) Complete business plans, including fore cast financial performance, capital \nexpenditure requirements and cash flows; \n(f) Details of all surplu s assets and contingent liabilities; \n(g) Details of offers for, and historical transactions in, the subject company’s shares; \n(h) Details of debt funding, including loan agreements;   \n(i) Articles of Association and any shareholder agreements; \n(j) Board minutes; \n(k) Audit information; and \n(l) Contemporaneous third-party valuation reports. \n \n32  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pl edges Report, paragraph 2.8. \nD9/1/15\n  BL-2017-000665 \n   Expert Report of Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  26 January 2022 \n \nConfidential   11  \n \n1.5.7  I agree with Mr Bezant that there are signifi cant deficiencies in the information available \nfor the underlying companies whose shar es were pledged.  In most cases the \ninformation set out in the preceding paragraph simply has not been made available to me for the purposes of the valuation exercise.  I have therefore attempted, where \npossible, to supplement the di sclosed information with publicly available information, \nincluding information sourced by Mr Bezant fr om public sources and financial databases.  \nIn some cases, the lack of sufficient inform ation results in very wide ranges of value.  \n1.5.8  Given the significant information deficiencies,  my valuations (like Mr Bezant’s), are \nnecessarily subject to uncertainty.

As discussed in section 2.2, I do not have sufficient \ninformation to assess reliably the appropriate discount that should be applied to each \nShare Pledge. \n2.1.3  I also have insufficient information to va lue Clendon and Derling reliably. For the sake \nof comparison, I compare my valuation of Re tal Group to the value implied by Clendon’s \nShare Pledges and present indicative valuat ion figures for Derling.  I note that a \nvaluation approach for Derling, based on va luation reports for various assets owned by \none of Derling’s subsidiaries, supports valu ations for Derling amounting to 47% and \n60% of the value of Derling implied by the Share Pledges as at 31 December 2014 and \n31 December 2015, respectively. \nTable 2-1  Comparison of my valuation of the Share Pledges to the pledged \nvalue: 31 December 2013 \n Company (UAH'm) Share pledge % pledged Pledged value My valuation Difference % Difference\nDZK-898 6% 363                  49 - 406 (314) - 43 (87%) - 12%\nDZK-1412 7% 484                  62 - 518 (422) - 34 (87%) - 7%\nDZK-1419 20% 1,016               64 - 91 (953) - (926) (94%) - (91%)\nDZK-1420 25% 1,258               79 - 112 (1,179) - (1,145) (94%) - (91%)\nEuro Tyres DZK-530 49% 1,985               NIL - 457 (1,985) - (1,528) (100%) - (77%)Dniproazot\nGoiania\nD9/1/17\n  BL-2017-000665 \n   Expert Report of Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  26 January 2022 \n \nConfidential   13  \n \nTable 2-2  Comparison of my valuation of the Share Pledges to the pledged \nvalue: 31 December 2014  \n \nTable 2-3  Comparison of my valuation of the Share Pledges to the pledged \nvalue: 31 December 2015 \n Company (UAH'm) Share pledge % pledged Pledged value  My valuation  Difference % Difference\nClendon\nRetal Group DZK-1585 49%             26,269  "}

I take a 0% discount as one end of my range because a minority \ndiscount is not applicable in circumstance s where, for example, 100% of a company’s \nshares have been pledged (in aggregate), or where the underlying shareholding has \nbeen valued with reference to a traded share price, or a transaction involving the \nbusiness itself.  Should more information become available, I may update my opinion as \nto the appropriate discount to apply to my va luation of the Share Pledges in this case.   \n2.2.4  Mr Bezant applies much larger  discounts to his valuations.  However, I consider his \nconcluded discounts to be overstated because: \n(a) On instruction, Mr Bezant treats the Share Pledges on a standalone basis, rather \nthan in aggregate, when assessing the si ze of minority discount to apply; \n(b) Mr Bezant does not consider whether hi s valuations implicitly reflect a DLOM, \ngiven that the multiples he derives for va luation purposes include companies that \nhe has identified to be illiquid; and \n(c) Mr Bezant has not considered future grow th prospects associated with companies \noperating in Ukraine when applying a bl anket discount to his valuation of \nUkrainian-based companies. \n2.3 Information deficiencies \n2.3.1  As set out in section 1.5, I consider there to be significant deficiencies in the information \navailable for the underlying companies w hose shares were pledged.  Given these \ndeficiencies, my Share Pledges valuations are necessarily subject to uncertainty and, in \nsome cases, result in very wi de ranges of value.  My valuation conclusions may require \nupdating should more info rmation become available. \nD9/1/20\n  BL-2017-000665 \n   Expert Report of Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  26 January 2022 \n \nConfidential   16  \n \n3 VALUATION APPROACH \n3.1 Introduction \n3.1.1  In this section, I discuss certain fundamenta l valuation concepts and methods for valuing \nnon-publicly traded companies.

In the nomenclature of business valuation, the different definitions of value are \ncalled \"standards of value.\"  It is important for the valuation practitioner to establish the \nappropriate standard of value prior to c onducting a valuation assignment so that the \nvaluation conclusion can be properly understood. \n3.2.2  In this case, I have assumed that the valuat ions should be conducted under the \"market \nv a l u e \"  s t a n d a r d  o f  v a l u e .   T h e  I n t e r n a t ional Valuation Standa rds Council standards \n(“IVSC Standards ”) define “market value” as follows: \n “[t]he estimated amount for which an asset or liability should \nexchange on the valuation date between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s length transaction, after proper \nmarketing and where the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion”.\n33 \n3.2.3  The IVSC Standards explain and expand on key elements of the market value definition.  \nNotably, the “willing buyer” is “ one who purchases in accordance with the realities of \nthe current market and with current market expectations …”.34  \n \n33  Exhibit MB-A10, clause 29, pdf page 13. \n34  Exhibit MB-A10, clause 30(d), pdf page 13.  \nD9/1/21\n  BL-2017-000665 \n   Expert Report of Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  26 January 2022 \n \nConfidential   17  \n \n3.2.4  A “willing seller”, according to the IVSC Standards, is “ motivated to sell the asset at \nmarket terms for the best price attainable in the open market afte r proper marketing, \nwhatever that price may be.  The factual ci rcumstances of the actual owner are not a \npart of this consideration because t he willing seller is a hypothetical owner. ”35      \n3.2.5  Lastly, the IVSC Standards specifies th e “highest and best use” standard: “[t] he market \nvalue of an asset will reflect its highest and best use.  The highest and best use is the \nuse of an asset that maximise s its potential and that is possible, legally permissible and \nfinancially feasible .”36 \n3.2.6  In its Re-Amended Reply, the Bank suggests that its alleged loss should be reduced by \nthe “ true value ” of the Transferred Assets.37  “True value ” is not a generally accepted \nvaluation standard.  Other standards of value include,  but are not limited to: \n(a) “Fair value”, defined as “[t] he estimated price for the transf er of an asset or liability \nbetween identified knowledgeable and willing parties that reflects the respective \ninterests of those parties ”.38  This definition of fair value is different to the \ndefinition of fair value under In ternational Accounting Standards. 39 \n(b) “Special value”, defined as “ an amount that reflects pa rticular attributes of an \nasset that are only of value to a special purchaser ”.40  A “special purchaser” is \ndefined as “ a particular buyer for whom a pa rticular asset has special value \nbecause of advantages arising from its ow nership that would not be available to \nother buyers in the market ”.41  \n(c) “Synergistic value”, defined as “ an additional element of value created by the \ncombination of two or more assets or in terests where the combined value is more \nthan the sum of the separate values ”.42  If the synergies are available to one \nspecific buyer then it is an  example of special value.43  \n(d) “Intrinsic value”, defined as “[t] he value that an investor considers, on the basis of \nan evaluation or available facts, to be t he “true” or “real” value that will become \nthe market value when other inve stors reach the same conclusion ”.44  \n3.2.7  The appropriate standard of value to be applie d in this case "}

One can value an entire company (i.e., all its assets) or one can value investment interests in the company.  \nThe market value of a company’s assets is typi cally referred to as the “enterprise value” \n(“EV”) of the business.  The enterprise value of a business is determined based on the \nexpected future cash flows produced by it s assets.  The EV of a business necessarily \nequals the sum of all investment interests in  the business.  The investment interests in \nthe business can consist of common shares (i.e ., equity capital), preferred shares, debt \nsecurities, unsecured loans, etc.   This valuation relationship is expressed in Figure 3-1, \nbelow. \nFigure 3-1  Fundamental corporate valuation model\n45 \n \n \n3.3.2  The value of debt is often expressed net of su rplus cash in order to calculate the EV.   \n3.3.3  I use the methodologies I describe in the following subsections to assess the EV at the \nvarious valuation dates, before deducting the value of net debt to calculate the value of \nthe assets available for distribution to shareholders, that is, the equity value. \n3.4 Valuation approaches \n3.4.1  Because the equity shares of privately held companies do not have a readily observable \nprice in the marketplace, these investm ents need to be valued using recognised \nvaluation methods.  In this subsection, I discuss valuation methodologies that are \ncommonly adopted to value privately held companies. \n3.4.2  The valuation of businesses can be a comp lex process.  The valuation practitioner \ntypically is required to conduct various an alyses, including forecasts of the future \nrevenues, expenses, profitability and cash fl ow generation associated with the asset or \nbusiness.  Such analyses require the va luation practitioner to make numerous \nassumptions and exercise prof essional judgements.  However, if accepted valuation \nmethodologies are implemented and basic valu ation principles are adhered to, a high \nlevel of confidence in the conclusions can be achieved. \n \n45  A company’s equity value is therefore calculated  as that company’s EV, less the value of net debt. \nD9/1/23\n  BL-2017-000665 \n   Expert Report of Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  26 January 2022 \n \nConfidential   19  \n \n3.4.3  There are several methodologies that can be used to value an income-producing \ninvestment or asset (e.g., trading/operati ng companies).

The two most widely used \nmethodologies are the discounted cash flow (“ DCF ”) Approach and the Market \nApproach.  The DCF Approach, also referred to as the \"Income Approach\", stems from \nthe fundamental premise that the value of an  asset can be determined by reference to \nthe cash flows it can produce.  The Market  Approach is based on the premise that the \nvalue of a company or asset can be determined by reference to similar companies or \nassets for which the price or other valuation information is already known.  It is also \nappropriate to consider any arm’s length transa ctions or offers made for the shares of \nthe subject company.   \n3.4.4  A less commonly used approach is the Net Assets Value, or Cost Approach, which \nprovides an indication of value based on the economic principle that a buyer will pay no \nmore for an asset than the costs to obtain an  asset of equal utility (whether by purchase \nor by construction).   \n3.4.5  I provide a brief overview of the basic valu ation approaches utilised under the market \nvalue standard in the subsections that follo w.  The appropriateness of each of these \nvaluation approaches varies according to the available information and the specific \ncircumstances of different comp anies within an industry.   \n DCF Approach \n3.4.6  The DCF Approach is a widely accepted valu ation approach because it is a practical \nimplementation of the theoretical financial concept that an income-producing asset’s \nvalue is equal to the present value of the futu re cash flows produced by the asset.  The \nDCF Approach involves projecting the future  cash flows that the business will generate, \ndetermining an appropriate discount rate that accounts for the level of risk or uncertainty \nassociated with such cash fl ows and then discounting the ex pected future cash flows to \npresent value as of the relevant date. \n3.4.7  In a DCF valuation, the cash flows produc ed by the business are calculated after \ndeducting all necessary expenses and taxe s that must be paid in conducting the \nbusiness.  Valuation practitioners typically refe r to this cash flow measure as “free cash \nflow,” as it represents the cash  flow available to be paid to  lenders and/or shareholders \nafter all expenditures have been met. \n3.4.8  After the proper measure of cash flow is comp uted, a discount rate is applied to express \nthe future cash flows in present value terms (that is, the value today of money that is \nexpected to be received in the future).  T he discount rate represents the financial return \nthat investors require in order to accept the risks of receiving the expected future free \ncash flow.  Generally, as the risk of the cash  flow stream increases so does the discount \nrate.  \n3.4.9  The discounted cash flows ar e then added together to calculate the value of the \nenterprise.  If the enterprise is expected to continue operating over the long-term, a \n“terminal value” representing the ongoing value of the business is calculated at the end \nof the projected cash flow pe riod and added to the total. \nD9/1/24\n  BL-2017-000665 \n   Expert Report of Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  26 January 2022 \n \nConfidential   20  \n \n3.4.10  The rate at which future cash flows are disc ounted (the discount rate) should reflect the \ntime value of money, i.e., that you would pr efer to receive one dollar today instead of \none dollar in the future and so you would accept  less than one dollar today in exchange \nfor one dollar in the future.

The discount ra te should also reflec t the risks associated \nwith the asset’s/business’ future operations , cash flow forecasts and capital market \nconditions.  All future cash flows have a degree  of risk associated wi th them: a risk that \nthe amounts received will be different to that expected, or even that it will not be paid \nat all.  This risk depends upon the asset; US government bonds only have the unlikely \nrisk of the US government defaulting, whereas a water company is riskier as it is exposed \nto a number of operational risks (even if people will always consume water), and a \nfashion company is riskier again as it also has the risks associated with customer \npreferences. \n Market Approach \n3.4.11  The Market Approach is a commonly used approach to determine the market value of a \ncompany or asset.   The Market Approach relies upon the market prices of similar \ncompanies or assets to determine the valu e of the subject business.  The Market \nApproach is frequently used by real-world in vestors, either as a primary method or to \nassess the reasonableness of a valuation using the DCF Approach.  The core principle \nunderlying the Market Approach is that simi lar companies should have similar values \n(when expressed on a like-for-like basis). \n3.4.12  If another company that is comparable to the subject business is publicly traded, the \nobservable share value of the comparable publicly traded company can be used to \nestimate the value of the subject business.  This method is commonly referred to as the \nComparable Publicly Traded Company method.  Likewise, when an investment that is \ncomparable to the subject business has recently  been purchased in a transaction, either \npartially or in total, the purchase price can be used to estimate the value of the subject \nbusiness.  This method is commonly referred to as the Comparable Transaction method.    \n3.4.13  Implementing the Market Approach generally entails the following steps: \n(a) Compile a list of publicly traded compan ies and/or recent transactions that are \npotentially comparable to the subject business; \n(b) Determine which companies/transactions are most comparable to the subject \nbusiness and eliminate any that are not comparable; \n(c) Using the real-world market prices and fi nancial and operational metrics from the \ncomparable companies/transactions, compute valuation ratios such as \nEV/revenue, EV/earnings before interest , tax, depreciation and amortisation \n(“EBITDA ”), EV/earnings before interest and tax (“ EBIT ”), price/book value \n(“P/BV ”), etc.;  \n(d) Analyse the relative comparability and circumstances of each comparable \ncompany/transaction and select the relevant valuation multiple; and  \n(e) Apply the valuation multiple to the subj ect business to determine the valuation \nconclusion. \nD9/1/25\n  BL-2017-000665 \n   Expert Report of Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  26 January 2022 \n \nConfidential   21  \n \n \nFigure 3-2  Illustration of application of Market Approach (Comparable \nPublicly Traded Company Approach) \n \n Net Assets Value Approach \n3.4.14  The \"Net Assets Value Approach\" or \"Cost A pproach\" provides an indication of value \nbased on the economic principle that a buyer will pay no more for an asset than the costs \nto obtain an asset of equal utility (whether by purchase or by co nstruction).

It is also often used when the \ncompany's assets are expected to be liquid ated (sometimes referred to as “break-up \nvalue”). \n3.4.16  Many assets are expected to generate more value to the owner than the initial cost \nincurred.  Those assets would not have been created if the value was expected to be \nlower than the initial cost.  Accordingly, the Cost Approach is often used as an indication \nof the minimum value of the asset, althou gh this is not always the case.     \n3.4.17  Several of the valued entities (and subsidiari es thereof) in this matter are non-operating \nholding companies.

Finally, I conclude on the \nlevel of discount I a pply in my valuations. \n4.2 Discount for Lack of Control \n Principle of a Control Premium  \n4.2.1  When a buyer intends to purchase shares of a company, such a buyer may be willing to \npay a premium above other potential purchase rs if the buyer believes they would be \nable to create additional value, usually by either operating the company in a more efficient manner or by benefiting from synergies.  In other words, when a buyer perceives \nthat a company’s profit is not being maximise d or the overall value of the target can be \nenhanced, the buyer might be persuaded to pay a premium above the established \nmarket price. \n4.2.2  The potential value of control is a functi on of the change in value derived from a \ntransition in company operation, as well as t he probability that this change will occur. \n \n53  IVSC, International Valuation Standard s, pdf pages 40-41, paragraph 30.17 ( TT-4 ). \n54  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, paragr aphs 3.43, A5.19, A8.73, A11.27, A12.48, A14.47, \nand A21.33 \nD9/1/33\n  BL-2017-000665 \n   Expert Report of Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  26 January 2022 \n \nConfidential   29  \n \n Application of DLOC \n4.2.3  In more recent times, the generic or blanke t application of a DLOC to value minority \ninterests (or conversely, a control premium to value a controlling interest) has been \nshown to be inappropriate. \n4.2.4  The concept of an implicit minority discou nt depressing the value of publicly traded \nshares was historically accepted by some valu ation practitioners.  In particular, two well-\nknown valuation practitioners, Dr Shannon Pratt and Chris Mercer, wrote many of the \nearly arguments supporting this view, and pioneered studies which showed that when \nm a j o r i t y  s t a k e s  i n  p u b l i c l y  t r a d e d  c o m p anies are purchased, they are sometimes \npurchased at some premium above the publicly traded share price.   \n4.2.5  This premium was described as a “control premium” and the implication was that the \npublicly traded prices must therefore be  depressed due to a corresponding “minority \ndiscount.”  Based on these studies, some va luation practitioners, and particularly the \nDelaware courts in the United States, began a practice of applying an average or median \n“control premium” (often around 30 percent). 55   This “control premium” was often \nquantified by looking at a large number of tr ansactions involving acquisitions of majority \nstakes in publicly traded companies, to determine the premium at which they were \nacquired relative to the publicly traded  share price prior to the transaction. \n4.2.6  More recently, the concept of the “control  premium”, or the corresponding “minority \ndiscount”, has been discredited.  Many valu ation practitioners now agree that publicly \ntraded shares are not implicitly depressed in  value due to a “minority discount.”  While \nit is tru e th at  some  transactions for majority stakes  i n publicly tr aded compani es are \nconducted at a premium to the share price, it  is now accepted that these premiums are \nnot a premium paid simply for control, but ra ther are often related to synergies (i.e., the \nconcept that when two companies are combined  there will be benefits that will make \nthe combined entity worth more than the sum of  its parts) and/or the view of the buyer \nthat the subject company is undervalued.56   \n4.2.7  Indeed, Dr Pratt and Mr Mercer themselves  have revised their vi"}

In a blog post in \nMarch 2011, Mr Mercer writes about the Dela ware courts continued use of “implicit \nminority discounts” in the valuation of private companies using a multiples-based approach, saying: \n “Interestingly, the Delaware chancellors have relied \nprimarily on works of Dr. Shannon P. Pratt and, believe it or \nnot, me, in reaching their conclusions regarding the [implicit \nminority discounts]  … Never mind that both Shannon and I \nhave modified our positions on the routine application of \ncontrol premiums when usi ng the comparable company \nmethod…”\n58 \n4.2.9  Dr Pratt and Mr Mercer are now of the op inion that minority discounts and control \npremiums may be close to nil wher e a company operates efficiently: 59 \n “If a company is being managed in an optimal manner and all \nshareholders are being treated equally, there might be very \nlittle room for a control premium or a minority discount.”60     \n4.2.10  Similarly, Professor Aswath Damodaran, a pr ominent finance and valuation professor at \nNew York University, stresses that a contro l premium will be relevant where a change \nin control would mean a company is managed better (and is particularly relevant for \ncompanies whose poor performance is caused by management): \n “Since the value of control derives from changing the way a \nfirm is run, there is no simple rule of thumb that can be used \nto determine what it is worth… the value of control can be \nzero if a firm is already optimally run.”61 \n \n58  Mercer, Statutory Fair Value, #5 The Im plicit Minority Discount, 21 March 2011 ( TT-7 ). \n59  Mercer, Statutory Fair Value, #5 The Im plicit Minority Discount, 21 March 2011 ( TT-7 ). \n60  ‘Business Valuation and Federal Taxes: Procedure, Law, and Pers pective’, Second Edition, David \nLaro and Shannon P.

One thing these premiums most emphatically have nothing to do  with is the value of control \nversus the value of no control.”\n62 \n4.2.12  Finally, Nath concluded that the theory of control premiums/minority discounts is so \nfaulty that: \n “With so much literature dem onstrating the invalidity of \n‘control premiums’ and ‘control premium data,’ it should be a \nstraightforward matter to have the report and testimony of \nany appraiser who wishes to assert a control premium \nexcluded from the courtroom.  In particular, the theory and application of control premiums  have by now been shown to \nhave been tested and found faulty, they have largely been \nrejected by most reputable appr aisers, it can be shown that \nthe error rate is close to 100% and, finally, no rebuttal \nwhatsoever has ever been written to support a claim that \n‘control premiums’ based on pu blic company acquisition \npremiums have any scientific validity.”\n63 \n4.2.13  An article from Financial Valuation and Liti gation Expert also cautions against using \nacquisition premiums: \n “Most, if not all of the U.S. business valuation \ncommittees/organizations teach that control and minority \nvalue emanates from the cash flows. It is not based on an arbitrary and unsupportable acquisition premiums paid when \na public company is acquired .  Why this use of control \npremiums from control premium studies continues is puzzling given the strong crit icisms on the use of such \ndata.”\n64 \n \n62  ‘ Best Practices Regard ing Control Premiums’, Eric Nath, The Canadian Institute of Chartered \nBusiness Valuators, 2011, pdf pages 4 to 5 ( TT-9 ). \n63  ‘ Best Practices Regard ing Control Premiums’, Eric Nath, The Canadian Institute of Chartered \nBusiness Valuators, page 29 ( TT-9 ). \n64  ‘ Control Premiums and Minority Di scounts in Operating Businesses ’, Financial Valuation and \nLitigation Expert, March 2012, pages 14 and 16 ( TT-10 ). \nD9/1/36\n  BL-2017-000665 \n   Expert Report of Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  26 January 2022 \n \nConfidential   32  \n \n Conclusion \n4.2.14  It is thus apparent that there is a str ong body of opinion that DLOCs and control \npremiums should not be applied unless there ar e specific circumstances that justify one.  \nIVSC Standards provide that it may be a ppropriate to apply a control premium in \ncircumstances where a new owner would be in a position to improve cash flows and/or \nenhance economic benefits.65  Conversely, a DLOC may be necessary where: \n(a) There is evidence of asset stripping or non-arms’ length transactions with the \nmajority owner, particularly in cases w here minority shareholders have limited \nlegal recourse; and \n(b) There is evidence that the company is being poorly managed by the majority \nshareholder. \n4.3 Discount for Lack of Marketability \n Principle of a DLOM \n4.3.1  Marketability is generally unders tood by valuers to refer to a seller’s ability to sell and \nrealise cash for their asset in a timely manner and at minimal cost. \n4.3.2  A DLOM is commonly expressed in percentage terms and reflects the amount deducted "}

It therefor e may be appropriate to  apply a DLOM when \nvaluing shares in a private company to reflect the fact that such interests are less liquid \nthan if they were traded publicly. \n Application of a DLOM \n4.3.4  DLOMs can be applicable to stakes in both public and private companies.  For example, \na single share in a public company is typica lly considered to be liquid, except in \nexceptional circumstances.  However, a su bstantial shareholding in a public company \nmay not be immediately realisable  at the current share price. \n \n65  IVSC, International Valuation Standards, paragraph 30.17 ( TT-4 ). \nD9/1/37\n  BL-2017-000665 \n   Expert Report of Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  26 January 2022 \n \nConfidential   33  \n \n4.3.5  DLOMs for privately held companies are oft en estimated by reviewing empirical studies \ninto the DLOM applied for minority shareholdings in a private company.  These studies \ninclude: \n(a) Restricted stock studies, which compare the price of privatel y placed stock in \nlisted companies with the price of shares  in that company that are part of the \npublic float; and \n(b) Pre-IPO studies, which compare the price of shares in private company \ntransactions to the price of identical shar es in the company once it is publicly \ntraded. \n4.3.6  I summarise the level of discounts observed in  such empirical studies in Appendix 5.  \nHowever, valuation practitioners are generally wary of relying too heavily on restricted \nstock and pre-IPO studie s to impute a DLOM.66  For example, a large portion of the \nrestricted stock transactions analysed in t hese studies are not profitable and do not pay \ndividends.67  The sample size is also not very large and is typically focused on US-based \nstocks.  One paper highlights the danger of re lying on restricted stock studies, stating: \n “Appraisers may face serious problems when relying on any \nof the restricted stock studies… relying solely on the means and medians of restricted stock studies is, therefore, likely to \nlead the appraiser to an erroneous DLOM conclusion… Thus \nalthough the restricted stoc k studies demonstrate the \nappropriateness of a DLOM in determining fair market value, \nthey reflect deficiencies that undermine their reliability for \npractical application when valuing privately held \nbusinesses.”\n68 \n4.3.7  Pre-IPO studies suffer from  similar pitfalls, as expl ained in the same paper: \n“Despite their continued use by  a segment of the valuation \ncommunity, as with restricted stock studies, pre-IPO study \nresults are unreliable for calcul ating the DLOM applicable to \na particular valuation engagem ent… the valuati on utility of \npre-IPO studies is seriously flawed.”69 \n \n66  See, for example, Aswath Damodaran,  The Cost of Illiquidity, page 22 ( TT-11 ). \n67  BV Insight, FMV Restricted Stoc k Study Not So Relevant, page 1 ( TT-12 ). \n68  'Using Restricted Stock and Pre- IPO Studies for Quantifying DLOM' , Marc Vianello, page 16 \n(TT-13 ). \n69  'Using Restricted Stock and Pre-IPO Studies for Quantifying DL OM', Marc Vianello, page 17 \n(TT-13 ). \nD9/1/38\n  BL-2017-000665 \n   Expert Report of Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  26 January 2022 \n \nConfidential   34  \n \n4.3.8 "}

The \nmodels used for this purpose and their principal shortcomings are as follows:72 \n(a) The Chaffe model, which produces DLOMs with a downward bias; \n(b) The Longstaff model, which assumes the investor has perfect timing so has an \nupward bias; \n(c) The revised Finnerty model, which caps the discount at 32.3% regardless of \ninputs; and \n(d) The Ghaidarov model, which generates discounts that are significantly higher \nthan those indicated by restricted stock studies. \n Conclusion \n4.3.10  To the extent it is appropriate to apply a DLOM to the company being valued, the size \nof the DLOM is dependent upon a variety of  company-specific factors.  Professor \nDamodaran discusses the following five determinants of a DLOM:73 \n(a) Liquidity of assets owned by  the firm – all else equal, companies with significant \nholdings of cash and marketable se curities will warr ant a lower DLOM; \n(b) Financial health and cash flows of the firm  – all else equal, a healthier firm will \nwarrant a lower DLOM; \n(c) Possibility of becoming a public firm – a ll else equal, where there is a higher \nprobability of becoming a public comp any this would warrant a lower DLOM; \n(d) Size of the firm – all else equal, la rger firms will warrant a lower DLOM; and \n(e) Control component – all else equal, a cont rolling stake is more attractive and will \nbe associated with a lower DLOM. \n4.3.11  I consider that the size of the applicable DLOM is a matter of professional judgement \nafter consideration of company-specific factors.

For example: \n(a) When discussing the range of marketabil ity discounts for minority interests, \nDr Pratt states “[n] aturally, each valuation should be analyzed on the basis of the \nindividual facts and circumstances.  A ccordingly, each individual noncontrolling \nequity interest valuation may justify a disc ount for lack of marketability above or \nbelow this typical range ”;88  \n(b) HMRC guidance from 2009 (which I believe is no longer in issue) states, “ but it is \nemphasised that valuers must rely on t he facts of the particular case and their \nown experience when deciding upon a reasonable level of discount ”;89 \n(c) The tax and duty manual issued by th e Irish Tax and Customs Authority from \n2018 states that “[v] aluation is not an exact science.  The value of a shareholding \ndepends on many factors – the natu re/size of the shareholding passing, \nprofitability of the business and its future prospects in the marketplace …”;90 and  \n(d) The 2014 CICBV textbook cited by Mr Bezant states that “[a] ssessing the amount \nto apply for a discount for illiquidity re quires the valuator to exercise his/her \nprofessional judgment in assessing the individual circumstances ...”.91  \n4.4.12  M r  B e z a n t  s t a t e s  t h a t  h e  i s  “ unable to prepare reliable assessments of the minority \ndiscounts that would apply to the shareholdings pledged because [he does]  not have \ninformation about the rights and obligations attached to these holdings ”.92  I agree with \nthe lack of information concerning the rights and obligations associat ed with the various \nshareholdings.  In my view, caution must be ex ercised when applying generic, or blanket, \nminority discounts, as Mr Bezant has done. \n \n86  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, paragraphs A5.13 to A5.15. \n87  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pl edges Report, paragraph A5.15. \n88  Exhibit MB-A94, pdf page 5. \n89  Exhibit MB-A92.

These multiples are calculated by \ndetermining the value per unit  of some other metric.  For ex ample, Mr Bezant calculates \nthe EV/Revenue multiple which is the value of a company’s assets per dollar of revenue \nthat the company generates, or the EV/E BITDA multiple which is the value of a \ncompany’s assets per dollar of  earnings before interest , taxes, depreciation, and \namortisation that the company earns.105 \n4.5.6  This is important to recognise because hi storical differences between two companies \nwill already be accounted for when a valuation multiple of one company is applied to \nthe metric of the subject company that is being valued.  As a hypothetical example, \nconsider that Company A is located in th e United States, has an EV of USD 1,000 \nand generated revenue of US D 500 last year.  The EV/Revenue multiple is 2.0x \n(USD 1,000 / USD 500).  Company B is locate d in Ukraine and generated revenue of \nUSD 50 last year.  When the 2.0x multiple is applied to Company B it is valued at \nUSD 100 (USD 50 x 2).  As can be seen, th is approach inherent ly accounted for the \nhistorical difference between Company A and Company B in terms of the two companies’ prior year revenue.  To the extent that one of the reasons Company B’s \nrevenues were lower last year was because it  was located in Ukraine, rather than the \nUnited States, this has already been accounted for without making any adjustment to the valuation multiple itself. \n \n105  Mr Bezant also calculated EV/EBIT multiples which is a similar earnings metrics, as well as a P/BV \nmultiple for some of the shareholdings which is th e equity value (or market capitalisation) divided \nby the book value of a company (an accounting metric).  All of these valuation multiples are \nrelative valuation metrics.  \nD9/1/46\n  BL-2017-000665 \n   Expert Report of Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  26 January 2022 \n \nConfidential   42  \n \n4.5.7  While these historical  differences between companies ar e accounted for by nature of \nthe relative valuation exercise, future  differences are not.

In essence, there are two \ncomponents which explain why the valuation mu ltiple for a particular company will be \nlower or higher than another: (i) future risk, and (ii) future growth.  Generally speaking, \none would expect a given company’s valuation multiple to move in the opposite direction \nof the expected future risk (i.e., higher risk  leads to a lower valuation multiple and vice \nversa) and to move in the same direction as  the expected growth (i.e., higher growth \nleads to a higher valuation multiple and vice versa).106 \n4.5.8  Taking the hypothetical example above, the k ey analysis as to whether any adjustment \nis warranted to the valuation multiple is based on any differences between the expected \nfuture risk and future growth of Company A and Company B.  In essence, Mr Bezant argues that because Company B is located in  Ukraine, it faces more future risk and \ntherefore the valuation multiple should be  reduced by 25%.  However, as I explain \nfurther in the two subsections below, I believe Mr Bezant’s analysis is flawed and overly \nsimplistic because he considers only generic country risk differences without considering \nthe specific risk characterist ics of the specific shareholdings that he is valuing, and \nbecause he has not considered future grow th prospects at all.           \n Mr Bezant’s analysis of Ukrain ian publicly traded companies  \n4.5.9  The first justification that Mr Bezant provid es for the 25% discount he applies to the \nvaluation multiples used when valuing the Uk rainian shareholdings is his comparison of \nvaluation multiples for publicly traded Uk rainian companies on the PFTS with the \naverage valuation multiples of public ly traded companies on the FTSE 100.107  Based on \nthis analysis, Mr Bezant concludes that “ companies in Ukraine generally trade at \nrelatively low valuation multiples ”.108  In my view, Mr Bezant’s analysis is flawed and his \nconclusion is unsupported for three reasons. \n \n106  This relationship was famously described by Professors Myron Gordon and Eli Shapiro in what is \nknown as the Gordon Growth Model which describes the price of a stock (P) as being equal to the \ndividend (D) multiplied by 1 divided by the discount  rate (R – a measure of risk) minus the expected \ngrowth rate (G):  \n P = D * (1 / (R – G)).

Indeed, Mr Bezant has \nnot performed any company-specific analysis  to determine whether the lower valuation \nmultiples of the small number of Ukrainian companies is explained by company-specific \nfactors rather than a generic Ukraine discount. \n4.5.11  Furthermore, by comparing a small sample of Ukrainian companies with a large sample \nof the 100 largest companies traded on the London Stock Exchange , Mr Bezant has not \ncontrolled for obvious differences between th e two groups, such as differences in the \nindustries in which the companies operate.  For example, of the six Ukrainian companies \nthat Mr Bezant calculated EV/EBITDA and EV/EBIT multiples for, three of them (i.e., 50%) are electric utilities.\n111  In contrast, there are only th ree electric utilities in the \nFTSE 100, making up just 3% of the companies.112  Any conclusions drawn from such a \ncomparison are not meaningful in my view. \n4.5.12  Second, the very large range in valuation mu ltiples calculated by Mr Bezant further \nsupports that company and industry-specific factors significantly impact the valuation \nmultiples and any conclusion drawn from the median multiples from a small sample is \nnot meaningful.  For example, Mr Bezant calculated that 10 Ukrainian companies had an \nEV/Revenue multiple ranging from 0.01x to 14.3x, a range of 143,000%.113   For the 100 \nlargest companies on the London Stock Exchan ge, the EV/Revenue multiples span from \n0.3x to 102.4x, a range of 34,000%.114  Given these massive rang es it is difficult to \nunderstand how anyone could make any conc lusions other than that there are very \nsignificant differences in the valuation mult iples which are clearly driven by company \nand industry-specific factors, and not explained solely by geographic location. \n4.5.13  Third, Mr Bezant acknowledges that the Uk rainian companies do no t meet EU liquidity \nguidelines which may affect  their valuation multiples.115  As discussed in section 4.4, Mr \nBezant separately applie s a DLOM.  Even if one were to accept his views on these issues \n(which I do not) there is therefore an element of double counting in Mr Bezant’s analysis \nto the extent he believes that the Ukra inian companies’ valuation multiples are \ndepressed due to low liquidity, and he then uses this to ju stify two separate discounts. \n \n109  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, Table A6-1. \n110  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, Table A6-2. \n111  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, Table A6-1. \n112  Being SSE, National Grid and Centrica.

As discussed in \nparagraphs 4.5.9 to 4.5.12, above, in my view  these factors clearly significantly influence \nvaluation multiples.  Furthermore, even if  country risk were the primary driver for \nvaluation multiples (and it is not), it is well established that country risk does not impact \nevery industry and company equally.  For example, Professor Damodaran, who has \nresearched CRPs extensively, discusses how CRPs should be adjusted based on \ncompany and industry-specific factors, rath er than one blanket CRP applied to every \ncompany operating in a particular country.119 \n \n116  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, paragr aph A8.73.  See also Mr Bezant’s First Share \nPledges Report, paragraphs A11.27, A12.48, A14.47,  and A21.33.  Mr Bezant’s comparison itself \nis in Appendix 6 to his report. \n117  These are the United States, Canada, France, Sweden, Belgiu m, Germany, Japan, Russia, China, \nSaudi Arabia, Thailand, Pakistan, Turkey, Poland, Slovenia, Greece, Croatia, Cyprus, and Vietnam. \n118  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pl edges Report, paragraph A14.47. \n119  'Measuring Company Exposure to Country Risk' , Aswath Damodaran, pages 27 and 28 ( TT-18 ). \nD9/1/49\n  BL-2017-000665 \n   Expert Report of Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  26 January 2022 \n \nConfidential   45  \n \n4.5.17  Second, as discussed in paragraphs 4.5.5 to  4.5.8, there are two key components that \nimpact valuation multiples: future risk and future growth.  However, Mr Bezant has only \nconsidered one of these two components (risk), while ignoring future growth entirely.  \nThis is plainly incorrect, as future growth  prospects can (more than) offset higher risk \nwhen calculating valuation multiples.120  Mr Bezant’s failure to assess the future growth \nprospects of the various companies is theref ore a foundational flaw with his analysis \nwhich renders his conclusion unreliable.   \n4.5.18  Mr Bezant’s failure to consider future grow th prospects is surprising given the economic \nenvironment in Ukraine around the valuatio n dates.  As discussed in Appendix 4, \nUkraine’s economy was significantly impacted by conflict and turmoil in the region in \n2014 and 2015 but was expected to recover by  late 2015 and early 2016.  To the extent \nthat the Ukrainian shareholdings were financia lly impacted by this turmoil, this would \nbe reflected in their historical financial perf ormance (revenues, EBITDA, etc.).  Mr Bezant \nthen applies his calculated valuation multip les to these depressed historical financial \nfigures (which would be expected  to recover going forward), but further reduces  the \nvaluation multiple to double coun t much of this risk.  In my view this is overly pessimistic \nand incorrect. \n4.5.19  Indeed, even if one were to consider only hi gh-level Ukrainian data, as Mr Bezant has \ndone for CRPs, one can see that  Ukraine was e"}

In my view this is overly pessimistic \nand incorrect. \n4.5.19  Indeed, even if one were to consider only hi gh-level Ukrainian data, as Mr Bezant has \ndone for CRPs, one can see that  Ukraine was expected to re cover in 2016 with real gross \ndomestic product (“ GDP ”) growth expected to increase  to 4% by 2021 according to the \nIMF.121  This level of real GDP growth is higher than was expected by the IMF for 16 of \nthe 19 countries considered by Mr Bezant.122 \n4.5.20  Third, Mr Bezant’s own data from his select ed comparable companies demonstrates that \nhis analysis and conclusions are incorrect.  For example, Mr Bezant notes that there was \njust one country out of 19 that he consid ered that had a higher CRP than Ukraine \n(Greece).123  If Mr Bezant’s hypothesis that higher CRPs lead to lower valuation \nmultiples were correct, then the Greek comp arable companies he selected should have \nvery low valuation multiples given that this  was the country with the highest CRP.  \nHowever, Mr Bezant’s data shows this was not the case, as is shown in Table 4-5, \nbelow. \n \n120  This can be seen mathematically using the Gordon  Growth Model, where the multiple is calculated \nas 1 divided by R (discount rate or risk) minus G (growth). Aswath  Damodaran, The Stable Growth \nDividend Discount Model ( TT-16 ).  Given that the expected future growth is deducted from the \ndiscount rate, this can directly offset (or ev en more than offset) the difference between two \ncompanies’ discount rates.  Consider for exampl e if Company A has a discount rate (R) of 10% \nand expected future growth (G) of 2%.  R – G for Company A 8%.  Now assume Company B is \nexposed to more risk and has a discount rate (R) of 14%, but is also expected to have higher \ngrowth (G) of 6%.  R – G for Company B is also 8%.  \n121  International Monetary Fund, Extr act from World Economic Outlook ( TT-19 ). \n122  International Monetary Fund, Extract from World Economic Outlook ( TT-19 ).

This clearly demonstrat es that there is not a direct relationship \nbetween the CRP of the country in which a co mpany operates and th e valuation multiple. \n4.5.22  Therefore, I believe that Mr Bezant’s conc lusion that Ukrainian companies in general \nshould be valued using discounted valuation multiples based on his review of CRPs is \nincorrect and based on a flawed analysis. \n \n124  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, Table A14-14. \nD9/1/51\n  BL-2017-000665 \n   Expert Report of Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  26 January 2022 \n \nConfidential   47  \n \n4.6 My concluded discount \n4.6.1  In my opinion, it is appropriate to apply a mi nority discount to my valuations of minority \nshareholdings underlying the Share Pledges (w hen taken in aggrega"}

In these circumstan ces, the discount recognises (among other \nfactors) the lower marketability of the Share Pl edges in comparison to the publicly listed \ncomparable companies. Without a dditional information it is difficult to conclude reliably \non an appropriate minority discount for each of the shareholdings underlying the Share \nPledges I have been instructed to value.  For illustrative purposes on ly, I apply a discount \nof 0% and 30%, which reflects the range of discounts I would expect to observe on \ndifferent shareholdings in these types of compan ies.  I take a 0% discount as one end of \nmy range because a minority discount is not applicable in circumstances where, for example, 100% of a company’s shares have been pledged (in aggregate), or where the \nunderlying shareholding has been valued with reference to a traded share price, or a \ntransaction involving the business itself.  \n4.6.2\n In the event that more information becomes available, I may update my opinion as to the \nappropriate minority discount to apply. \n4.6.3  I consider Mr Bezant’s applic ation of generic minority discounts, along with a further \ndiscount to the multiples he applies in the valuation of certain Ukrainian-based \ncompanies, to be problematic for the following reasons: \n(a) In my opinion, it is inappropriate to apply generic minority discounts; \n(b) Any minority discount cannot be reliably  applied given the lack of information \nabout the nature of the shareholdings being valued and the corporate governance of the companies in question; and \n(c)\n Mr Bezant’s analysis of the effect of ge ography on valuation multiples is flawed \nand appears to be contradicted by other evidence he has submitted. \n4.6.4  Moreover, Mr Bezant’s discounts appear  to be overstated.  For example: \n(a) On instruction, Mr Bezant treats the Share Pledges on a standalone basis when \nassessing the size of minori ty discount to apply, rather than in aggregate; \n(b) Mr Bezant does not consider whether hi s valuations implicitly reflect a DLOM, \ngiven that the multiples he derives for va luation purposes include companies that \nhe has identified to be illiquid; and \n(c) Mr Bezant has not considered future grow th prospects associated with companies \noperating in Ukraine when applying a blan ket discount to his valuation of the \nUkrainian companies. \nD9/1/52\n  BL-2017-000665 \n   Expert Report of Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  26 January 2022 \n \nConfidential   48  \n \n4.7 My valuation of the Share Pledges \n4.7.1  In Table 4-6 to Table 4-9, I set out my valuation of the Share Pledges, after applying an \nillustrative only minority discount of 0% and 30%.

In some case s, where we applied different approaches or \nused different sources of financial informat ion, it had little effect on the valuation \nconclusions. \n5.3.2  In this section, I identify the principal differences between our valuations. \n Clendon \n5.3.3  Neither I nor Mr Bezant have sufficient inform ation to value Clendon.   Our valuations of \nRetal Group, a subsidiary of Clendon at the va luation dates, differ in our application of \nmultiples.130  Mr Bezant has not weighted the three comparable companies he relies on \nfor his valuations, implicitly assumi ng each to be of equal relevance.131  In contrast, I \nhave recognised the most comparable of my identified companies and have weighted it \naccordingly in my valuations.132  Consequently, my valuation of Retal Group exceeds \nthat of Mr Bezant, with th e effect being more pronounced at 31 December 2015. \n GM \n5.3.4  Mr Bezant valued GM on a net asset basis, whereas I a pply revenue-based multiples \nand the multiple implied by the 2013 transaction in GM’s subsidiary.133  Mr Bezant did \nnot value GM using multiples on the basis th at GM’s subsidiaries conduct different \noperations and he did not have financ ial information for each subsidiary.134  However, I \nunderstand GM and its subsidiaries functi on as a single business unit and therefore \nconsider the application of multiples to th e consolidated financial information to be \nappropriate.135 \n \n130  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pl edges Report, paragraph A7.2. \n131  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pl edges Report, paragraph A7.38. \n132  Appendix 7, section A7.5. \n133  Appendix 8, Table A8-17; Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, paragraph A10.51. \n134  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, paragraphs A10.48 and A10.50. \n135 ` Appendix 8, paragraph A8.5.9. \nD9/1/57\n  BL-2017-000665 \n   Expert Report of Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  26 January 2022 \n \nConfidential   53  \n \n Derling \n5.3.5  Mr Bezant concludes on a value of nil for Derling, whereas I consider that I do not have \nsufficient information to arrive at a valuation for Derling.136  Mr Bezant values Derling by \nreference to its net asset value, and values Derling’s subsidiary, Skorzonera, by reference \nto valuation multiples and its net asset value.137  I value Skorzonera by both reference \nto valuation multiples and valuation reports for assets owned by Skorzonera, and also consider the value of Derling’s stakes in two add"}

Therefore, I consider that it is more appropriate to value Euro Tyres by \nreference to management’s own value in use calculations for the company, and a \nproposed transaction fo r Euro Tyres’ shares.156  Furthermore, I understand that \nEurotyre SA intended to conv ert the principal of its relate d party loan to equity and I \ntherefore value Euro Tyres on two bases: (a) treating Eurotyre SA’s loan as debt and \n(b) treating the principal of that loan as equi ty on the basis that it was converted into \nshare capital in July 2015.157 \n Stalmag \n5.3.12  Mr Bezant and I both value Stalmag by re ference to valuation multiples implied by \ncomparable companies, although we have calculated slightly different multiples.158  We \nhave both applied our valuat ion multiples to financial metrics taken from Stalmag's \nfinancial statements.159  We both conclude that Stalmag’s shares were likely \nundervalued in the Share Pledge at all valuation dates. \n \n155  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, Table A16-14. \n156  Appendix 15, Table A15-13. \n157  Appendix 15, paragraph A15.5.2. \n158  Appendix 16, Table A16-13; Mr Bezant’s  First Share Pledges Report, Table A20-14. \n159  Appendix 16, paragraph A16.4. 3; Mr Bezant’s First Share Pl edges Report, paragraph A20.10. \nD9/1/60\n  BL-2017-000665 \n   Expert Report of Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  26 January 2022 \n \nConfidential   56  \n \n6 EXPERT’S DECLARATION \nI, Travis Taylor, declare that: \n6.1.1  I understand that my duty in providing written reports and giving evidence is to help the \nCourt, and that this duty overrides any obli gation to the party by whom I am engaged or \nthe person who has paid or is liable to pay me .
