Unless otherwise \nindicated, I adopt the abbreviations and acro nyms used in my First and Second Report. \n1.1.3  I understand that my primary duty is to the Cour t.

Specifically, I have been asked \nto provide my expert opinion on the value of certain Share Pledges. \n1.2.2  In my First Report, I provided my opinion on the value of 10 of the companies (whose \nshares were the subject of Share Pledges), being: \n(a) Clendon; \n(b) GM; \n(c) Derling; \n(d) Dniproazot; \n(e) Goiania; \n(f) Feral; \n(g) Retal Dnipro; \n(h) Memento;  \n(i) Euro Tyres; and \nD12/1/4\n  BL-2017-000665 \n  Supplemental Expert Report of  Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  14 July 2022 \n \nConfidential   2  \n \n(j) Stalmag. \n1.2.3  In my Second Report, I provided my opinion on the value of the following 15 companies: \n(a) Antarktika; \n(b) Penny Lane; \n(c) Teide; \n(d) Kyivguma; \n(e) KFC; \n(f) Dinacom; \n(g) Gilton; \n(h) Mawex; \n(i) Vikna-Plast; \n(j) Autorembitservis; \n(k) Dnipronaftoprodukt; \n(l) AVK; \n(m) Triika; \n(n) Erlan; and \n(o) Ukrinterinvest. \n1.2.4  In the First Joint Statement, I updated my valuations of: \n(a) Memento; and  \n(b) Kyivguma. \n1.2.5  In this report, I summarise the differences be tween Mr Bezant’s and my valuations of the \ncompanies we have been instructed to cons ider.  The most significant differences \nbetween me and Mr Bezant (together, the “ Experts ”) relate to differences in the \nvaluation methodologies we have adopted.  In particular, I consider the following \nmethodologies to be relevant to assessing the value of certain Share Pledges whereas \nMr Bezant does not: \n(a) Third-party valuations; \n(b) Transactions in the shareholdings of the underlying companies; and \n(c) Adjusted net asset value. \n1.2.6  Mr Bezant and I also disagree as to the disc ounts that should be applied in respect of \nthe Share Pledges, and in this report I refine my application of such discounts in this \ncase. \nD12/1/5\n  BL-2017-000665 \n  Supplemental Expert Report of  Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  14 July 2022 \n \nConfidential   3  \n \n1.3 Other statements \nInformation relied upon \n1.3.1  Appendix 1 contains a summary of the sources of information upon which I have relied \nin preparing this report.  If, subsequent to the issuance of this report, witness statements \nand/or further documentary or other evidence are made available, I reserve the right to \nupdate my conclusions accordingly. \n1.3.2  Except where expressly stated otherwise in  this report, I have assumed that all \ninformation provided to me is complete and accurate.  Unless I indicate otherwise, I did not undertake any audit, review or other proced ures of any kind to verify the accuracy or \ncompleteness of the information provided. \n1.3.3  Some of the documents I have reviewed in this matter were originally provided in \nRussian, Ukrainian, Polish, Romanian and Portuguese.  I do not read or speak these \nlanguages.  I have therefore relied upon mach ine translations and translations provided \nto me by Fieldfisher and Secretariat sta ff (who read and speak Russian, Ukrainian and \nPolish).   \nInformation deficiencies \n1.3.4  As I explained in my First Report,1 there are significant deficiencies in the information \navailable for all the underlying companies whos e shares I have been instructed to value. \n1.3.5  Lack of information has made it particul arly difficult to value Clendon and Derling \nreliably.  As such, for the purpose of my  valuation conclusions in my reports: \n(a) I base my conclusions for Clendon on the value of one of its subsidiaries, Retal \nGroup; and  \n(b) I present indicative valuation figures for Derling, based on the incomplete \ninformation I have regarding its subsidiaries and assets. \n1.3.6  Given the significant information deficiencies,  my valuations of all the Share "}

However, we have been unable to conclude reliably on the appropriat e discount to apply to the shareholding in \neach of the subject companies because of a la ck of information regarding, in particular, \nthe company itself and the rights and obligati ons attached to the pledged shareholding. \n2.2.2  In my First and Second Reports, I applied a discount of 0% and 30% to my range of \nvaluations for each company, for illustrati ve purposes.  These discounts reflected the \nrange of discounts I would expect to observ e on different shareholdings in these types \nof companies. \n2.2.3  I recognise that the illustrative discounts I applied in my First and Second Reports did \nnot reflect either the size of the pledged  shareholding or the valuation methodology \nadopted.  I have therefore prepared valuatio ns applying different illustrative minority \ndiscounts, which reflect: \n(a) The aggregate size of the shareholdings pledged at each valuation date; and \n(b) The valuation methodology applied in respect of each of the companies \nunderlying the Share Pledges. \n2.2.4  Applying these updated illustra tive discounts as presented in Table 5-6 to Table 5-9 \ndoes not materially change my conclusions  as to the value of the Share Pledges. \n2.3 Discounts for country risk \n2.3.1  When valuing the six companies based in Ukra ine, Mr Bezant applies a 25% discount to \nthe earnings and revenue multiples of identif ied comparable companies on the basis that \nthese companies operate in lower-risk ju risdictions than the subject companies. \n2.3.2  I recognise that Mr Bezant’s adoption of this additional discount in his valuations does \nnot materially change his valuation conclu sions.  However, I consider both his \napplication and adoption of such a discount to be flawed because: \n(a) Mr Bezant applies a blanket discount  across all six Uk rainian Companies \nregardless of the industry or the composit ion and nature of his chosen comparable \ncompanies; \n(b) Mr Bezant justifies the alleged existence,  but not the size, of his 25% discount \nthrough analysis of listed company mult iples in different geographies, and the \npremiums added to disc ount rates for different geographies; and  \n(c) Mr Bezant has not considered the effect of, among other things, industry or \ncompany-specific factors or future growth  prospects of the subject companies or \nthe identified comparable companies. \nD12/1/9\n  BL-2017-000665 \n  Supplemental Expert Report of  Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  14 July 2022 \n \nConfidential   7  \n \n3 SIGNIFICANT AREAS OF DI SAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE \nEXPERTS \n3.1 Introduction \n3.1.1  In the First Joint Statement, Mr Bezant and I identified that we concluded on \nsubstantially different valuations for the following seven companies: \n(a) Derling; \n(b) Mawex; \n(c) Dniproazot; and \n(d) Autorembitservis, Vikna-Plast, Gilton and Dnipronaftoprodukt (each of which \nown petrol stations). \n3.1.2  The differences between Mr Bezant’s and my valuations are addressed in section 6 of \nour First Joint Statement.

In total, the valuations perfor med by PwC are 11% higher than the pledged \nvalues in 2014 and 45% lower in 2015.6  In the absence of suppo rting valuation reports, \nMr Bezant and I have been unable to expl ain the difference between our valuations and \nthose attributed to PwC.7 \n3.2.6  Contemporaneous third-party valuation reports are often a useful source of support for \nthe value of a company or asset.  I have take n into account third-party valuations for my \nvaluations of: \n(a) Dniproazot;  \n(b) Goiania; and  \n(c) Derling and Mawex, in relation to their respective 91.3% and 6.5% shareholdings \nin Skorzonera. \n \n3  SMIDA is the Stock Market Infrastruc ture Development Agency of Ukraine. \n4  The third-party valuations for the companies I have been instructed to value are summarised at \nsection 3.5 of my First Report. \n5  First Joint Statement, paragraph 5.3. \n6  First Joint Stateme"}

IVS 105 \nstates that “ price information from an active mark et is generally considered to be the \nstrongest evidence of value ”.8  IVS 105 further states that “ the market approach should \nbe applied and afforded significant weight  [if] the subject asset  … [is] actively publicly \ntraded ”.9 \n3.2.9  There is limited information regarding the transactions available on SMIDA, so I am \nunable to reconcile or explain the diff erence between the values implied by such \ntransactions and other valuation methodologies  considered.  However, I have not relied \non the value implied by share transacti ons where there is evidence of price \nmanipulation10 or the transaction data reco rded on SMIDA is inconsistent.11 \n3.2.10  I have relied upon transactions in the shares  of the subject company reported on SMIDA \nfor the following companies: \n(a) Dniproazot; \n(b) Antarktika; \n(c) Kyivguma;  \n(d) Dnipronaftoprodukt; and \n(e) Erlan. \n \n8  IVSC, International Valuation Standards, paragraph 10.8 ( TT-4 ). \n9  IVSC, International Valuation Standards, paragraph 20.2 ( TT-4 ). \n10  My Second Report, paragraphs A15.5.4 to A15.5. 8 and A16.5.4 to A16.5.7.  There is evidence of \nprice manipulation in transact ions of AVK and Triika shares. \n11  My Second Report, paragraph A8.5.3.  Transactions in KFC shares are for inconsistent prices.  For \nexample, there were six transactions on 1 De cember 2014 which imply a 100% value of KFC \nranging from UAH 70 million to UAH 860 million. \nD12/1/13\n  BL-2017-000665 \n  Supplemental Expert Report of  Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  14 July 2022 \n \nConfidential   11  \n \nAdjusted net asset value \n3.2.11  I consider adjusted net asset values in my valuations of:12 \n(a) The companies that hold an interest in  Skorzonera (Derling and Mawex);  \n(b) The companies that own petrol stations (Gilton, Vikna-Plast,  Autorembitservis, \nand Dnipronaftoprodukt); and \n(c) Ukrinterinvest, which owns two real esta te properties at my valuation dates. \n3.2.12  For the companies listed above, I adjust thei r net asset value to reflect the market value \nof their underlying assets.  For example, in the absence of consolidated financial \ninformation, I use Mr Bezant’s and Mr Kaczmar ek’s valuations of the petrol stations to \nadjust the net asset value of Gilton,  Vikna-Plast, Autorembitservis, and \nDnipronaftoprodukt based on the number of pe trol stations purportedly owned by each \nof these companies. \n3.2.13  Holding companies are frequently valued by reference to their book value because they \nare non-operational.  Where there is evidence that the market value of their subsidiaries \nexceeds the book value at which they are reco gnised in the parent’s accounts, I consider \nit is necessary to adjust the net asset value of the parent companies to reflect the market \nvalue of the subsidiaries. \n3.3 Limitations of valuations \n3.3.1 "}

I have therefore not been able to undertake as robust a valuation exercise as \nI would want, resulting in valuations that ar e necessarily subject to uncertainty and, in \nsome cases, necessarily large value ranges.13  Mr Bezant agrees that his valuations are \nalso subject to uncertainty arising from the deficiencies in the information disclosed in \nthis case.14 \n3.3.2  For example, I consider there to be insuffic ient information for anyone to value Derling \nreliably.  Based on the information available to  me, I have an incomplete picture of the \nsubsidiaries and assets ultimately owned by  Derling and therefore I have been unable \nto conclude on a value for this company.15 \n \n12  I also consider the book net asset value for Feral, Antarktika and Dinacom, but do not make any \nadjustments to reflect the market  value of any of their assets. \n13  My First Report, section 1.5. \n14  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pl edges Report, paragraph 2.8. \n15  My First Report, paragraph A9.1.3. \nD12/1/14\n  BL-2017-000665 \n  Supplemental Expert Report of  Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  14 July 2022 \n \nConfidential   12  \n \n4 SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR OR AGREED VALUATIONS \n4.1 Introduction \n4.1.1  Based on the limited information available to us , Mr Bezant and I agree that the value of \nthe pledged shareholding for the following 17 companies does not exceed the value \nrecorded in the Share Pledge:16 \n(a) Clendon; \n(b) GM; \n(c) Goiania; \n(d) Feral; \n(e) Retal Dnipro; \n(f) Memento;  \n(g) Euro Tyres;  \n(h) Antarktika; \n(i) Penny Lane; \n(j) Teide; \n(k) Kyivguma; \n(l) KFC;  \n(m) Dinacom; \n(n) Erlan; \n(o) Ukrinterinvest; \n(p) AVK; and \n(q) Triika. \n4.1.2  Stalmag is the only company for which Mr Bezant and I agree that the value of its \npledged shareholding may be more than t he value recorded in the Share Pledge.17 \n \n16  First and Second Joint Statements. \n17  First Joint Statement, paragraph 3.9.  In particular, we agree that our valuations of the pledged \nshareholdings in Stalmag are hi gher than the values recorded  in the Share Pledges as at \n31 December 2014 and 2015.  As at 31 October 20 16, my valuation of the pledged shareholding \nfalls towards the centre of my range. \nD12/1/15\n  BL-2017-000665 \n  Supplemental Expert Report of  Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  14 July 2022 \n \nConfidential   13  \n \n4.1.3  In this section, I discuss my valuations of companies that were not specifically addressed \nin my Joint Statements with Mr Bezant be cause we concluded th at we had reached \nreasonably similar conclusions.

In particular, I consider that  Resilux shares the following characteristics \nwith Retal Group:\n29 \n(a) Focus on the European market : both derive the majority  of their revenue from \nEurope; \n(b) Size: both are comfortably larger than the other comparable companies, with each \nproducing 5-10% of all PET preforms in Europe; and \n(c) Market power : a 2015 European Commission report  on the industry stated that \nResilux and Retal Group were in a “ similar competitive position ” and perceived by \ncustomers to be “ similar in terms of offering, price and service ”. \n4.3.10  As summarised in Table 4-6, below, had Mr  Bezant chosen to weight his selected \nmultiple towards Resilux,30  which I consider to be the most comparable to Retal Group \nat 31 December 2014 and 2015, his multiples wo uld have been higher and closer to the \nmultiples that I use. \nTable 4-6  Multiples for Retal Group, 31 December 2014 and 201531 \n \n \n29  My First Report, paragraphs A7.5.5 and A7.5.6. \n30  I recognise that, had Mr Bezant adopted this weighting at 31 December 2014, he would have \napplied lower multiples in his valuation than he actually used. \n31  Appendix 2, worksheet “Clendon ”.  For the purpose of this table, I apply the same weighting to \nMr Bezant’s comparable companies as I apply to my own (that is, 60% Resilux and 20% to each \nof the other companies); however, I consider Mr Be zant’s multiples to be less comparable than my \nown, given that my comparable companies are focussed on Eastern Europe, which more closely \nmatches Retal’s operations.  As such, if Mr Bezant were to adopt my approach to weighting the \nmultiples, he should consider weighting it  more heavily towards Resilux than I did. 31-Dec-14 31-Dec-15 31-Dec-14 31-Dec-15\nMy multiples\nErgis S.A. 6.2x 6.3x 10.8x 10.8xResilux NV 9.3x 11.2x 17.9x 21.6x\nSuwary S.A. 7.0x 7.5x 14.1x 22.7x\nMedian 7.0x 7.5x 14.1x 21.6xWeighted average 8.2x 9.5x 15.7x 19.6x\nMr Bezant's multiples\nResilux NV 9.3x 11.2x 17.9x 21.6xSrithai Superware Public \nCompany Limited7.7x 7.3x 15.8x 16.3x\nEcoPack Limited 2.5x 3.7x 3.5x 5.9x\nMedian 7.7x 7.3x 15.8x 16.3x\nWeighted average 7.6x 8.9x 14.6x 17.4xEV/EBIT EV/EBITDA\nD12/1/21\n  BL-2017-000665 \n  Supplemental Expert Report of  Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  14 July 2022 \n \nConfidential   19  \n \n4.3.11  Mr Bezant’s selected multiple (and valuat ion) would also have been higher had he not \nadopted EcoPack Limited as a comparable comp any, ignoring his concerns about (a) the \nfact that its market capitalisation was less than 10% of Clendon’s Share Pledge32 and \n(b) its more risky country of operation in comparison to Retal Group and the other \ncomparable companies.33  Had Mr Bezant not included EcoPack Limited within his \ncomparable companies, his valuation of Retal Group would have been significantly \nhigher and fallen comfortably within my valuation range.34 \n4.3.12  At the 31 October 2016 valuation date I do not weight my multiples to reflect Resilux’s \nhigher comparability.

Mr Bezant has: \n(a) Mr Bezant has miscalculated EBITDA by fa iling to add back all of Retal Group’s \ndepreciation and amortisati on charged in FY2014 and FY2015;\n36 and \n(b) Mr Bezant has not accounted for the sma ll minority interest recognised on Retal \nGroup’s balance sheet.37 \nGM \n4.3.14  As summarised in Table 4-7, below, Mr Beza nt and I adopt different approaches to value \nGM.  Whilst Mr Bezant values GM based on its net asset value, I assess GM based on \nthe value implied by P/BV and EV/Revenue multiples. \n \n32  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pl edges Report, footnote 141. \n33  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pl edges Report, paragraph A7.34. \n34  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pl edges Report, footnote 141. \n35  My First Report, paragraph A7.5.7 and A7.5.9. \n36  It appears that Mr Bezant has only added back  the depreciation charged to cost of sales and \ntherefore ignored depreciation recognised as part of distribution and administrative expenses as \nwell as Retal Group’s amortisation expense.  Compare First Joint Statement, Appendix 5 (Updated Appendix 28), worksheet “Clendon Holdings”, to Exhibit MB-A129, pages 38 and 39. \n37  Minority interest represents the portion of th e companies consolidated in  Retal Group’s financial \nstatements that are held by other parties.  Acco rdingly, metrics which incl ude it misrepresent the \nequity value attributable to Retal Group shareholders.  In each of FY2014 to FY2016, Retal Group \nrecognised small losses attributable  to minority interest.   Deducting this negative interest thus \nincreases Retal Group’s book and equity value (My First Report, Appendix 7, footnote 42). \nD12/1/22\n  BL-2017-000665 \n  Supplemental Expert Report of  Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  14 July 2022 \n \nConfidential   20  \n \nTable 4-7  Valuations of GM38 \n \n4.3.15  Mr Bezant and I agree that GM is a holding company with an interest in entity GAA \n(42.88% from 2013; 38.59% from 2016).39  GAA held six (seven in 2016) wholly owned \nsubsidiaries and an indirect interest in a further entity (toget her with GM, the GM \nGroup):40 \n(a) Georgian Manganese LLC, CC Metals and Alloys LLC, and Felman Production \nLLC, which manufacture ferroalloys; \n(b) Vartsikhe 2005 LLC, which operates hydro po wer stations to generate electricity \nused to produce ferroalloy products; \n(c) Felman Trading, which sells ferroalloys; \n(d) Feromedi, which provides medical services for GM Group employees; and \n(e) GAAM, which provides support services (finance, procurement, sales, logistics \nand legal). \n4.3.16  Mr Bezant adopted a different valuation appr oach to my own because he considers that \nGAA’s subsidiaries operated separately, wher eas I assume that GM Group operated as \na business unit.41  Mr Bezant indicated that he wo uld prefer to perform a sum-of-the-\nparts valuation for GAA bu t concluded that he was unable to do so because:42 \n \n38  Appendix 2, worksheet “GM” and “Valuation  Summary”; First Joint Statement, Appendix 5 \n(Updated Appendix 28), worksheet “GM”. \n39  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, para graph A10.17 and Figure A10-1; My First Report, \nFigure A8-1. \n40  My First Report, paragraph A8.3.3. \n41  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pled ges Report, paragraph A10.50; my First Report, par"}

Based on this \ninformation, I conclude that it is appropriat e to value GM Group as a single business unit \non the basis that the subsidiaries oper ate together to mine, produce and sell \nferroalloys.43  As explained in the financial statem ents for companies in the GM Group: \n(a) GAA “and its wholly-owned subsidiaries  … is a miner of manganese ore and a \nproducer and distributor of high-quality ferroalloys”;44 and \n(b) GAA’s “management views the mining, ferroalloy production and hydro-power \nproduction as an integrated business unit”.45 \n4.3.18  I therefore apply multiples to GAA’s co nsolidated financial results, based on:46 \n(a) The P/BV multiple of 1.2x implied by the transaction in GAA in April 2013; and \n(b) The median EV/Revenue implied by the comparable companies of 1.1x in \n31 December 2014, 0.9x in 31 December 2015 and 1.3x as at 31 October 2016. \n4.3.19  In his First Share Pledges Report, Mr Bezant  explains that he does not know whether \nthe 2013 GAA transaction was at market va lue because it was between entities that \nwere ultimately controlled by the First and Second Defendants.47  I have seen no \nevidence to suggest that the GAA transacti on was not undertaken at market value and \nI rely upon the implied P/BV multiple on t he basis that it occurred within reasonable \nproximity to my valuation dates.   \nGoiania \n4.3.20  As summarised in Table 4-8, below, Mr Beza nt and I adopt different approaches to value \nGoiania.

Mr Bezant does not use Fe ral’s net asset value to  inform his valuation \non the basis that some companies in the industry have a P/BV less than 1.0x suggesting that some assets needed to be impaired to  reflect lower market values, or that the \nbusinesses had contingent liabilities not  recognised on their balance sheets.\n61  However, \nI do not agree that these observations would apply to Feral: \n(a) Feral’s land and buildings were included in  its financial statem ents at fair market \nvalue at 31 December 2013;62 and \n(b) There is no evidence that Feral had contingent  liabilities that were not recognised \non its balance sheet.63 \n4.3.30  I therefore consider that it is appropriate to rely upon Feral’s net asset value to inform \nthe upper end of my valuation range. \nRetal Dnipro \n4.3.31  Mr Bezant’s valuations of Retal Dnipro’s 100% equity va lue at 31 December 2014 and \n2015 fall within my valuation ra nges at these dates, as summarised in Table 4-10, \nbelow.  Mr Bezant values Retal Dnipro us ing P/BV multiples, which inform the lower \nend of my valuation range.  The high end of my range is based on EV/Revenue multiples. \n \n61  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pl edges Report, paragraph A9.45. \n62  My First Report, paragraph A12.5.5.  The land and buildings recognised in Feral’s 2013 financial \nstatements reconcil e to a third-party valuation report. \n63  Contingent liabilities are possi ble obligations dependent on a future event or a present obligation \nthat is unlikely to be paid or cannot be quantified .  Contingent liabilities should be disclosed in the \nnotes to an entity’s financial statements; howeve r, the disclosed financial information for Feral \ndoes not contain notes.  I would expect that Fe ral’s auditors would have identified contingent \nliabilities in their audit report if these were a part icular concern to Feral.

In Table 4-12, below, I present  Mr Bezant’s EV/Revenue multiple-based \nvaluation with, and without, the application of  a 25% discount to the median comparable \ncompany multiple to reflect the ri sks of operating in Ukraine.   \n4.3.33  As summarised in Table 4-12, Mr Bezant’s EV/Revenue valuation is similar to mine, \ndespite the differences in the comparable comp anies we use to derive  multiples for Retal \nDnipro.\n65 \nTable 4-12  Retal Dnipro’s 100% equity value based on EV/Revenue multiples66 \n  \n \n64  Appendix 2, worksheet “Retal Dnipro” and “Valuation Summary”; First Joint Statement, Appendix \n5 (Updated Appendix 28), worksheet “Retal Dnipro”.

These “outliers” have multiples greater \nthan most of the comparable companies he has identified.78  It seems to me that \nneither Mr Bezant nor I are in a position to identify outliers, given that: \n(i) We have been unable to explain satisfactorily the significant growth \nobserved in Stalmag’s revenue and profits between FY2010 and FY2016;79 \nand \n(ii) More than half of Mr Bezant’s ea rnings-based multiples are either \nidentified as having negative multiples,  having multiples in excess of 300x \nor being outliers, which may indicate that the wide range of multiples is a feature of the industry.\n80 \nAntarktika \n4.3.46  As summarised in Table 4-17, below, Mr Bezant and I have used different \nmethodologies to value Antarktika and its subsidiaries, with the result being that \nMr Bezant’s valuation of Antarktika falls at  the lower end of my valuation range.   \n4.3.47  However, the primary difference in our valuations relates to the fact that I treat \nAntarktika to be a holding company and therefore primarily value it based on the \nfinancial information and results of its la rgest subsidiary, IMRP, whereas Mr Bezant \ntreats Antarktika as an operating company. \n \n77  Appendix 2, worksheet “Stalmag”; First Joint Statement, Appendix 5 (Updated Appendix 28), \nworksheet “Stalmag”.   \n78  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, Table A20-8. \n79  My First Report, paragraphs A16.4.6 and A16.7.1. \n80  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, Table A20-8. \nD12/1/34\n  BL-2017-000665 \n  Supplemental Expert Report of  Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  14 July 2022 \n \nConfidential   32  \n \nTable 4-17  Valuations of Antarktika81 \n \n4.3.48  Mr Bezant concluded on the value of Antarktika  with reference to P/BV multiples.

My valuation \nof Antarktika at the later dates is higher because the upper end of my range is based on \nEV/Revenue multiples applied to IMRP’s revenue, which increased significantly between \n2013 and 2015.82 \n4.3.49  When considering his valuation conclusion, Mr Bezant only considers valuations based \non Antarktika’s financials rather than IMRP’s.83  However, our valuations of IMRP under \nthe EV/Revenue multiples approach are simi lar when excluding Mr Bezant’s application \nof a 25% Ukrainian discount, as summarised in Table 4-18, below.

The extent \nto which my valuations of Retal Group ar e indicative of Clendon’s value depends on \nClendon’s financial position and other business activities, for which no information has \nbeen disclosed.125 \n \n121  Mr Bezant’s Second Share Pled ges Report, paragraph A6.32.   \n122  My Second Report, paragraph A16.5.21. \n123  My Second Report, paragraphs A16.5.7 and A 15.5.4 to A15.5.8; Mr Bezant’s Second Share \nPledges Report, paragraph A6.23 to A6.28. \n124  My First Report, section 1.5. \n125  My First Report, section A7.7. \nD12/1/47\n  BL-2017-000665 \n  Supplemental Expert Report of  Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  14 July 2022 \n \nConfidential   45  \n \n5 DISCOUNTS  \n5.1 Introduction \n5.1.1  Mr Bezant and I disagree as to the appropriate discounts, or level of discount, applicable \nto our respective valuations of the Share Pledges, relating to: \n(a) Minority discounts; and \n(b) Discounts for country risk. \n5.1.2  In this section, I discuss the conceptual differences between the Experts regarding these \ndiscounts and expand on the analysis  I performed in my First Report. \n5.2 Minority discounts \n5.2.1  Mr Bezant and I agree that it  is appropriate to consider the application of a minority \ndiscount to valuations of minority sh areholdings underlying the Share Pledges.126 \n5.2.2  Neither Mr Bezant nor I have sufficient inform ation to conclude reliably on an appropriate \nminority discount for each of the sharehol dings underlying the Share Pledges that we \nhave been instructed to value.127  In order to assess properly  the discount that would be \napplicable to a minority valuation, we would need to understand the rights and \nobligations attached to the pledged shareholdings. \n5.2.3  In my First and Second Reports, I applied an  illustrative discount of between 0% and \n30%, which reflects the range of discounts I would expect to observe on different \nshareholdings in these types of companies:128 \n(a) A discount of 0% may apply in circum stances where, for example, 100% of a \ncompany’s shares have been pledged (in aggregate), or where the underlying shareholding has been valued with reference to a traded share price, or a \ntransaction involving the business itself; and \n(b)\n A discount of up to 30% may apply in ci rcumstances where, for example, a small \nprivate shareholding of, say, less than 25% has been pledged (in aggregate) \nand/or the underlying private shareholding has been valued with reference to publicly traded companies. \n \n126  First Joint Statement, paragraph 7.2. \n127  First Joint Statement, paragraph 7.3. \n128  My First Report, paragraph 4.6.1.

I note that Mr Bezant was instructed \nto treat the Share Pledges on a standalone basis, rather than in aggregate, the \neffect of which is to increase the mi nority discount which Mr Bezant applies;129 \n(b) The composition of other shareholders: wher e the rest of the shareholding is held \nby one single shareholder, a larger discount may be appropriate, particularly in \ncircumstances where the motivations of t he majority shareholder do not align with \nthe minority shareholders’ best interests; and \n(c) The methodology used to value the underlyi ng shareholding.  For example, where \nthe private shareholdings underlying t he Share Pledges have been valued by \nreference to publicly listed comparable companies, the application of a discount \nmay recognise (among other factors) the lower marketability of  the Share Pledges \nin comparison to the publicly listed comparable companies.  Equally, where a \ncompany is valued by reference to its net asset value, this is often seen as being \nequivalent to the value of the compan y on a break-up basis in which case a \nmajority shareholder would be unlikely to enjoy greater economic benefits than a \nminority shareholder. \n5.2.5  Given the lack of information, I did not explic itly address each of the factors listed above \nin each of my Share Pledge valuations.  I rec ognise that my application of an illustrative \nminority discount of 0% to 30% to every underlying company was simplistic.   \n5.2.6  I still do not have sufficient information to  determine the appropriate minority discount \nfor each Share Pledge but, in order to assi st the Court, I have updated my assessment \nof the applicable minority discount to refl ect (a) the size and (b) valuation methodology \napplied in respect of each of the Share Pledges.   \n5.2.7  In Table 5-1, below, I present a guide for the illustrative minority discounts I apply to my \nvaluations of the Share Pledges  given the aggregate size of shareholding and applicable \nvaluation approach.  For the avoidance of doub t, the illustrative discounts presented in \nTable 5-1 do not reflect all factors that need to be considered when assessing the \napplicability and quantum of a minority discount. \n \n129  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, paragrap hs 1.16(2) and 2.64; my First Report, section 4.4. \nD12/1/49\n  BL-2017-000665 \n  Supplemental Expert Report of  Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  14 July 2022 \n \nConfidential   47  \n \nTable 5-1  Guide to illustrative minority discounts – according to size of \nshareholding and applicable valuation approach130 \n \n5.2.8  I present my illustrative minority discounts fo r the Share Pledges I have been instructed \nto value in Table 5-2 to Table 5-5.

However, I do not  agree that it is necessary to apply a generic \nand unsupported additional discount to the multiples derived from comparable \ncompanies operating in different territories. \n5.3.5  Mr Bezant does not explain how he concluded th at a discount of 25% should be applied.  \nIn his First Share Pledges Report, he perfor ms the following analyses, which he uses to \njustify the existence of a discount: \n(a) Comparison of Ukrainian company mu ltiples to UK company multiples .  \nMr Bezant compares the valuation multipl es of publicly traded companies on the \nPFTS (a Ukrainian stock exchange) with  the average valuation multiples of \npublicly traded companies on the FTS E 100 (an index comprised of the 100 \nlargest companies traded on the London Stock Exchange).142  Based on this \nanalysis, Mr Bezant concludes that some of the comparable listed companies had \nvaluation multiples “ much higher than the typical multiples [he had]  observed in \nUkraine ”;143 and \n \n140  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, para graph A8.73.

Mr Bezant \ncompares the CRPs for Ukraine and t he countries in which the comparable \ncompanies operate (a total of 19 countries) and notes that Ukraine has a higher CRP than all but one (Greece).\n144  Mr Bezant uses this comparison to frame his \n25% discount as equivalent to increasing the discount rate applied to a standard \nset of cash flows (in a DCF Approach) by 3-4%.145 \n5.3.6  In my opinion, Mr Bezant’s an alyses are flawed, overly simplistic, and do not support his \napplication of a blanket 25% discount to the valuation multiples used to value the \nUkrainian shareholdings. \n5.3.7  In this section, I discuss Mr Bezant’s justif ication of his country risk discount based on: \n(a) Mr Bezant’s analysis of Ukrainia n publicly traded companies; and \n(b) Mr Bezant’s analysis of the CRPs for Ukraine and the countries in which the \ncomparable countries operate. \n5.3.8  I provide further detail and analysis in Appendix 3. \nMr Bezant’s analysis of Ukrain ian publicly traded companies \n5.3.9  In my view, Mr Bezant’s analysis of Ukra inian companies listed on the PFTS and FTSE \n100 companies is flawed and his conclusion that “ companies in Ukraine generally trade \nat relatively low valuation multiples ”146 is unsupported for the following reasons: \n(a) I do not consider the comparison of P FTS companies with FTSE 100 companies \nto be meaningful; \n(b) Very few PFTS companies have multiples data available; and \n(c) Mr Bezant has not considered other factor s which could impact multiples, such as \nmarketability and industry classifications. \nComparing PFTS and FTSE 100 companies  \n5.3.10  I do not consider the comparison of PFTS an d FTSE 100 companies to be a meaningful \nassessment of the differences in multiples due to country risk for various reasons. \n(a) First, to the extent he believes that th e Ukrainian Compan"}

For the avoidance \nof doubt, neither Expert has utilised the DC F Approach to value the Ukrainian Companies. \n146  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pl edges Report, paragraph A6.1. \n147  My First Report, paragraph 4.5.13. \nD12/1/59\n  BL-2017-000665 \n  Supplemental Expert Report of  Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  14 July 2022 \n \nConfidential   57  \n \n(i) A Ukrainian discount, which Mr Bezant  adopts despite acknowledging that \nthe PFTS companies do not meet EU li quidity guidelines which may affect \ntheir valuation multiples;148 and \n(ii) Mr Bezant separately applies a minority discount, which reflects, inter alia , \na discount associated with the reduced marketability of minority \nshareholdings.149 \n(b) Second, Mr Bezant does not acknowle dge that FTSE 100 companies typically \nhave a large global presence with the majority of revenues being generated \noverseas.150  Therefore, the multiples of FTSE 100 companies would not only be \ninfluenced by the UK’s risk and growth prospects. \n(c) Third, Mr Bezant applies a size filter when identifying comparable companies for \nhis valuations to exclude co mpanies that he deems too large relative to the entity \nbeing valued, but does not apply the same reasoning to his comparison of PFTS \nand FTSE 100 companies.  The market ca pitalisations of FTSE 100 companies are \nsignificantly larger than the market capita lisation of those listed on PFTS, with the \nmedian market capitalisa tion of the FTSE 100 compan ies being around 300 times \ngreater than the median of the PFTS compan ies.  I discuss this further in Appendix \n3. \nSmall number of PFTS companies with multiples data \n5.3.11  Mr Bezant has analysed only 15 publicly trad ed Ukrainian companies, many of which do \nnot have sufficient data to calcul ate the relevant valuation multiples.151  Mr Bezant then \ncompares the valuation multiples of this sm all sample of Ukrainian companies with the \nvaluation multiples of the 100 largest companies traded on the London Stock \nExchange.152  In my view, such a small sample is simply not an adequate basis upon \nwhich to draw any conclusions about the value of Ukrainian companies generally. \nEffect of company-specific factors \n5.3.12  Mr Bezant has not performed any company-specific analysis to determine whether the \ndifference in multiples is explained by comp any-specific factors rather than a generic \nUkraine discount.  There is a large range in the multiples for FTSE 100 companies which \nis evidence that a company’s multiples are infl uenced by factors other than risks specific \nto the country they are listed in.153   \n \n148  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pl edges Report, paragraph A6.2. \n149  My First Report, section 4.4. \n150  The FTSE 100 vs FTSE 250 ( TT-203 ). \n151  My First Report, paragraph 4.5.10. \n152  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, Table A6-2. \n153  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, Appendix 30;  Table A3-3. \nD12/1/60\n  BL-2017-000665 \n  Supplemental Expert Report of  Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  14 July 2022 \n \nConfidential   58  \n \n5.3.13  The PFTS and FTSE 100 companies have a very different mix of industries, for \nexample:154   \n(a) Almost 50% of"}

I examine the multiples for the most common FTSE 100 \nindustries in further de tail in Appendix 3. \nMr Bezant’s analysis of Country Risk Premiums \n5.3.15  The second justification that Mr Bezant pr ovides for the existence of a discount for \ncountry risk is his comparison of the CRPs for Ukraine and the countries in which his identified comparable companies operat e, concluding that Ukraine is a “\nhigher-risk \njurisdiction ”.158  Mr Bezant compared the CRP for Ukraine with the CRPs for the countries \nin which his selected comparable comp anies operate (a total of 19 countries)159 and \nnotes that Ukraine has a higher CRP than all but one (Greece).160   \n5.3.16  I consider Mr Bezant’s analysis based on CR Ps to be flawed for the following reasons: \n(a) Mr Bezant has not considered industry or company-specific factors in his \ncomparison of CRPs; \n(b) Mr Bezant has not considered future grow th prospects, which can have significant \ninfluence on valuation multiples; \n(c) The multiples for Mr Bezant’s comparab le companies contradict his hypothesis \nthat a higher CRP leads to lower valuation multiples;  \n(d) Mr Bezant has applied his di scount for country risk uniformly, not considering the \ncountries his comparable companies operate in; and \n(e) Mr Bezant has only considered the CRP as at 31 December 2015. \n5.3.17  I discuss these points further in the following paragraphs and Appendix 3. \n \n154  Table A3-2. \n155  Table A3-2.  (4 + 3) / 15 = 47%. \n156  Table A3-2.  (2 + 5) / 96 = 7%. \n157  Table A3-2.  67 + 4 + 4 + 8 = 83. \n158  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pled ges Report, paragraph A8.73.

In my view, these \nfactors clearly influence valuation multiples. \n5.3.19  Furthermore, it is well established that countr y risk does not impact every industry and \ncompany equally.161  For example, three of Mr Bezant’s comparable companies for \nDniproazot are located in Turkey and operate in the same industry, but their valuation \nmultiples vary greatly.162  I discuss specific exampl es further in Appendix 3. \nFuture growth prospects \n5.3.20  There are two key components that impact va luation multiples: future risk and future \ngrowth.

Mr Bezant has only considered fu ture risk, while ignoring future growth \nentirely.  Future growth prospects can more  than offset higher risk when calculating \nvaluation multiples.163  Mr Bezant’s failure to assess the future growth prospects of the \nvarious companies is a fundamental flaw in his analysis which renders his conclusion \nunreliable in my view. \n5.3.21  High-level Ukrainian data as  at October 2015 indicates that  Ukraine was expected to \nrecover in 2016 with real annual GDP grow th expected to increase to 4% by 2020 \naccording to the IMF.164  Ukraine’s average projecte d real GDP growth between 2016 \nand 2020 was higher than expected by the IMF for 16 of the 19 countries considered by \nMr Bezant.165  In Appendix 3, I provide a specific  example of how growth prospects can \ninfluence multiples.166 \nRelationship between CRP and valuation multiples \n5.3.22  The multiples for the comparable companies selected by Mr Bezant contradict his \nhypothesis that higher CRPs lead to lower valuation multiples. \n \n161  My First Report, paragraph 4.5.16. \n162  Table A3-5.  EV/EBITDA multiples range from 5.9x to 17.8x and EV/EBIT multiples range from \n6.7x to 21.9x. \n163  My First Report, paragraph 4.5.17 and footnote 120. \n164  International Monetary Fund, Extract fr om World Economic Outlook, October 2015 ( TT-204 ). \n165  International Monetary Fund, Extract from World Economic Outlook, October 2015 ( TT-204 ).  The \nthree countries that were expected to have high er real GDP growth than Ukraine were China, \nPakistan and Vietnam.  The Unit ed States, Canada, France, Swed en, Belgium, Germany, Japan, \nRussia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Turkey, Poland, Slovenia, Greece,  Croatia, and Cyprus were all \nexpected to have lower real  GDP growth than Ukraine. \n166  Paragraphs A3.1.31 to A3.1.33. \nD12/1/62\n  BL-2017-000665 \n  Supplemental Expert Report of  Travis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  14 July 2022 \n \nConfidential   60  \n \n5.3.23  For example, out of the 19 countries Mr Beza nt considered, Mr Bezant notes that there \nwas just one country with a higher CRP than Ukraine (Greece).167  If Mr Bezant’s \nhypothesis that higher CRPs lead to lower valuation multiples were correct, then the \nGreek comparable companies he selected should have lower valuation multiples.  \nHowever, Mr Bezant’s data contradict s this, as summarised in Table A3-8. \nUniform application of discount \n5.3.24  I do not consider Mr Bezant to have corre ctly applied his discount for country risk.  \nSpecifically, Mr Bezant applies his 25% discou nt for country risk uniformly to the median \nmultiples of comparable companies without considering the CRP of  these comparable \ncompanies.  Mr Bezant’s uniform application of the country risk discount is not logical \nand could result in him double-counting aspect s of his assumed country risk where such \nrisks are already adequately accounted for in his selected multiples as a result of \ngeographical filtering.168 \nThe date of Mr Bezant’s analysis \n5.3.25  Mr Bezant has only considered CRPs as at  31 December 2015.  Mr Bezant does not \nexplain why he limits his anal ysis to 31 December 2015 de spite valuing the Ukrainian \nCompanies at 31 December 2013, 2014 and 2015 (where relevant).169   \n \n167  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, paragraph A14.47. \n168  Appendix 3. \n169  For example, Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledge s Report, paragraph A21.33.
