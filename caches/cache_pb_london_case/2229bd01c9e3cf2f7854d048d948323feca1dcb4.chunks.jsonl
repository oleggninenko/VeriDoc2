Introduction  \nIntroduction  \n1.1 I am the same Mark Bezant who prepared two reports dated 24 November 2022 \n(my “ Share Pledges Report ”, or “ MB1 -SP”, and my “ Transferred Assets Report ”, \nor “MB1 -TA”) in this matter.1 \n1.2 In this report, I provide further evidence in respect of the Share Pledges. I refer to \nthis report as the “ Second Share Pledges Report ”.  \n1.3 In my Share Pledges Report (referred to in this report as my “ First Report ”), I was \ninstructed to provide my opinion on the market value of the shareholdings \npledged in the 28  pledges that the First Defendant relies on in D1 RRAD  and \nSchedule 6  to D1 RRAD, which purportedly pledge shares in 21 companies.  \n1.4 The First Defendant appointed Mr Travis Taylor (“ Mr Taylor ”) to perform a similar \nexercise. He has produced reports dated 26 January 2022  (“Mr Taylor’s First \nReport ” or “ TT1”) and  21 February 2022 (“ Mr Taylor’s Second Report ” or “ TT2”).  \n1.5 In his reports, Mr Taylor valued  the same 28 pledges that I valued in my First \nReport , together with certain pledges that I was not instructed to value. I \nsummarise the additional pledges that he considered in Table 1-1 below  (the \n“Additional Share Pledges ”). These pledges relate to two companies I considered \nin my First Report (Dinacom and KFC) and four companies which I did not consider \n(PJSC Erlan (“ Erlan ”), Ukrinterinvest TOV (“ Ukrinterinvest ”), PJSC AVK Finance \n(“AVK ”) and PJSC Triika Invest (“ Triika ”), or collectively the “ Additional Pledge d \nCompanies ”). \n \n \n1  I use the same defined terms in this report that I used in my Share Pledges Report. I set \nout additional defined terms and relevant defined terms from my First Report in the \nglossary to this report.  \nD8/253/3\nConfidential  \n29 April 2022  \n \nSecond Share Pledges R eport of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 4 Table 1-1: Additional Share Pledges considered by  Mr Taylor  \nCompany  Share Pledge  \nDinacom  DZK-3936  \nDZK-3940  \nKFC DZK-1153  \nErlan  DZK-1416  \nDZK-1529  \nDZK-1530  \nDZK-2178 \nDZK-2179 \nDZK-3921 \nDZK-3922  \nDZK-3923  \nDZK-3925  \nDZK-3926  \nDZK-3927  \nUkrinterinvest  DZK-1526  \nDZK-1527  \nDZK-1528  \nAVK CY001W/8z  \nCY02KB/2z  \nTriika  CY00XC/9z  \n400825/13z  \nSource: SP-JS: Appendix 2.  \n1.6 On 10 March 2022, the First Defendant produced a  draft amended version of \nSchedu le 6 to D1RRAD (“ Draf"}

In preparing  my First R eport, my team and I reviewed over 3,000  \ndocuments . Since then , my team and I have reviewed more than 3,500 additional \ndocuments  that were subsequently disclosed . It is possible that there are other \npotentially relevant documents in disclosure of which I am not aware. As \nexplained in this report, and notwithsta nding the large number of documents I \nhave reviewed, I have limited reliable information with which to conduct my \nvaluations. As in my First Report, t his does not affect my overall conclusions that \nthe values in the Share Pledges were overstated.  \n1.11 As I exp lained in my First Report, I cannot read or speak Ukrainian, Croatian, \nPolish, Portuguese, Romanian or Russian (being languages in which documents \nrelating to some of the companies I value are prepared). I have accordingly relied \non translations of certain  documents that were originally in these languages, or \nexplanations of such documents provided by members of my team who speak \nthese languages (for Ukrainian, Polish and Russian documents).  \n \n \n2  Exhibit MB -A220 : Supplemental letter of instruction . \n3  The terminated pledges are DZK-1149a  (KFC), DZK-1149b  (KFC) and DZK -[no number] \n(Dinacom).  \n4  In my First Report I used the term “Share Pledges ” to refer to the pledges that were the \nsubject of my analysis. In this report I use this term to refer to the revised set of pledges \nthat is the subject of my updated instructions  which include the Additional Share Pledges .  \n5  Mr Taylor als o performs valuations as at 31 October 2016  (SP-JS: ¶¶ 2.9 and 2.10) .  \nD8/253/5\nConfidential  \n29 April 2022  \n \nSecond Share Pledges R eport of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 6 Restrictions  \n1.12 I understand that this report may be made available to the Defendants and their \nadvisers and to the Court.

I provide my underlying calculations in \ntheir native spreadsheet format alongside this report.  \nStructure of this report  \n1.16 The structure  of the remainder of this report is as follows .   \n1.17 In Section 2, I set out the additional valuations I have been instructed to perform . \n1.18 In Section 3, I set out my de claration as an expert.  \n1.19 I set out supporting analyses and calculations in the appendices to this report.  \nD8/253/6\nConfidential  \n29 April 2022  \n \nSecond Share Pledges R eport of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 7 2. My valuations  \nIntroduction  \n2.1 In this section I:  \n(1) summarise my valuation s in respect of the Additional Share P ledges ; and   \n(2) compare these valuations to those of Mr Taylor . \nResults of my further valuation work  \n2.2 I have been instructed to extend my analysis to consider the A dditional Share \nPledges, including performing valuations of four companies that I was not \ninstructed to value  in my First Report. These companies are Erlan, Ukrinterinvest, \nAVK and Triika. The Draft Amended Schedule 6  refers to 78 Share Pledges which \npledge shareholdings in these four companies. I am i nstructed to value a subset of \n18 of these , which comprise the  Additional Share Pledges that Mr Taylor valued in \nhis reports.  \n2.3 I set out  my detailed assessments in respect of each company in Appendix 3  to \nAppendix 6 , and provide my underlying calculations in their native spreadsheet \nformat in Appendix 7 and Appendix 8 . In summary:  \n(1) my valuations (like Mr Taylor’s) impl y that the values in the Share Pledges \nrelating to these companies were significantly  overstated;  and \n(2) in any instances where the underlying analysis of the values contained in \nthe Share Pledges has been disclosed, it contains significant flaws and is \nwholly unreliable .  \n2.4 I have also been instructed to consider three  further Share Pledges  that I was not \ninstructed to value in my First Report,6 relating to Dinacom and KFC, which are \ncompanies that I valued in my First Report. In line with Mr Taylor’s approach:  \n(1) in respect of Dinacom , I have updated my assessment as at \n31 December  2015 t o compare my valuations to the values in two Share \nPledges initiated as at that date ;7 and  \n \n \n6  DZK-3936 , DZK-3940 , DZK-1153 . \n7  In my First Report, in the absence of any other information, I compared my valuation to \nthe value in a Share Pledge that was terminated on 31 December 2015.  \nD8/253/7\nConfidential  \n29 April 2022  \n \nSecond Share Pledges R eport of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 8 (2) in respect of KFC, I have updated my assessments as at 31 December 2013 \nto compare my v"}
