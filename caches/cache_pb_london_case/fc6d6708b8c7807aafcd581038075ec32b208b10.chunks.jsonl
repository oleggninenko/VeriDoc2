I have been instructed by Hogan Lovells International \nLLP (“ Hogan Lovells ”), English solicitors  for JSC Commercial Bank PrivatBank (the \n“Bank ”, or the “ Claimant ”), to prepare an expert report in the dispute between \nthe Bank and the eight d efendants listed on the front of this report  (the \n“Defendants ”). I refer to the Claimant and Defendants  collectively as the \n“Parties ”. \n1.2 I am a Senior Managing Director at FTI Consulting  LLP (“ FTI Consulting ”), a global \nexpert services firm specialising in, among other things, litigation support and \nvaluation . I lead FTI Consulting’s Economic and Financial Consulting practice in \nEMEA and Asia Pacific.  \n1.3 I have extensive  experience of the valuation of shares and other assets.

My \nvaluation experience covers busi nesses operating in Ukraine and other economies \nin the former Soviet Union, and a wide range of industries. I am the founding and \nformer chair of the Valuation Community of the Institute of Chartered \nAccountants in England and Wales. I attach a copy of my qualifications and \nrelevant experience at Appendix 1  to the Share Pledge s Report  (introduced \nbelow) . \n1.4 This is one of two expert reports that I have produced dated 24 November 2021. \nThese reports address separate matters relating to the dispute between the \nParties.  I set out my instructions in respect of this report, which relates to the \n‘Transferred Assets’, further below. I refer to this report as the “ Transferred \nAssets Report ”. I provide my evidence in respect of the share pledges in a \nseparate report (the “ Share Pledge s Report ”). \nBackground  \n1.5 The background to this matter is set out in other documents which I understand \nare available to the Court. For that reason, in  the following paragraphs , I only \nsummarise my understanding of the Parties' respective cases as they relate to the \nmatters I have been instructed to consider . This summary is not intended to be \ncontentious, but I may not be aware of all the matters in dis pute between the \nParties.  \nD19/1/4\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 5 \n Overview of the dispute  \n1.6 I am instructed that Mr Kolomoisky (the “ First Defendant ”) and Mr Bogol yubov \n(the “ Second Defendant ”) were majority shareholders and officers of the Bank \nfrom around 2004 until its nationalisation in Decemb er 2016.1 The Bank alleges \nthat the Third to Eighth Defendants (the “ Defendant Suppliers ”) were from (at \nthe latest) January 2013 owned and/or controlled by the First and Second \nDefendants.2 This is denied by the First and Second Defendants.3 \n1.7 The Bank's case is that the First and Second Defendants procured the \nmisappropriation of approximately USD  1,911m from the Bank in the manner \ndescribed in paragraphs 1 6 to 32 of the RRAPOC (the “Misappropriation ”).4  \n1.8 The Misappropriation is alleged to have involved, inter alia , the Bank making a \nseries of purported loans to the 47 Ukrainian and three Cypriot borrowers  as \nidentified in Schedule 1  of RRAPOC  (the “ Borrowers ”) between April 2013 and \nAugust 2014 (the “ Relevant Loans ”).5 The Ba nk’s case is that drawdowns under \nthe Relevant Loans (the “ Relevant Drawdowns ”) caused payments to be made to \nthe Defendant Suppliers under purported supply agreements,6 which were not \nreturned to the Borrowers under those supply agreements.  \n1.9 The First Def endant alleges that sums outstanding under the Relevant Loans were \nsecured by pledges over, inter alia,  shares in companies other than the Borrowers \n(the “ Share Pledges ”). \n1.10 The Bank denies that the Relevant Loans were secured by the Share Pledges; it \nallege s, inter alia , that the Share Pledges were not intended to create enforceable \nobligations but were put in place on the instructions of the First and Second \nDefendant to hide the Misappropriation.7 \n \n1  RRAPOC, ¶¶ 3 to 4; D1 RRAD, ¶ 6; and D2 RAD, ¶ 13. Short forms used for references, \nincluding references to the Parties’ pleadings, are found in Appendix 2.  \n2  RRAPOC, ¶ 12. \n3  D1 RRAD, ¶ 10(1); and D2 RAD, ¶¶ 16 to 18.  \n4  RRAPOC,  ¶ 52(1).  \n5  RRAPOC, ¶ 16. \n6  RAREP, ¶ 27; and Claimant’s RRFIs dated 5 and 22 May 2020, page 2.  \n7  RAREP, ¶ 7. \nD19/1/5\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 6 \n 1.11 The Bank alleges that the value accorded to the assets pur portedly pledged by the \nShare Pledges, as recorded in the Share Pledges themselves, materially exceeded \nthe actual value of those assets.8 \n1.12 The Parties each have permission to adduce expert evidence in relation to the \nactual value of the shares"}

In short, the Bank accepts that its loss claimed in these \nproceedings will be reduced by reference to that portion of the true value16 of the \nTransferred Assets17 which is properly to be attributed to the reduction of the \noutstanding balances under Relevant Drawdowns (whether directly or indirectly \nvia Intermediary Drawdowns).18 \n1.16 The Parties each have permission to adduce expert evidence in relation to the \ntrue value of the Transferred Assets .19 I value some of these assets in this report. \nOthers are valued in the reports of  Mr Paul Thomas  (relating to certain real \nestate)  and Ms Olga Razzhivina  (relating to aircraft) , each dated 24 November \n2021.20  \nOverview of the Transferred Assets  \n1.17 The First D efendant disaggregates the Transferred Assets between:21 \n(1) the “ Relevant Loan Transferred Assets ” (or “ RLTAs ”), being assets that he \ncontends were transferred to reduce the amount of the Relevant Loans; \nand \n(2) the “ Intermediary Loan Transferred Assets ” (or “ ILTAs ”), being assets that \nwere transferred to reduce ‘Intermediary Loans’.22 \n \n16  As distinct from the values purportedly recorded in the mortgage agreements associated \nwith the T ransferred Assets (RAREP, ¶ 27F.4.2).  \n17  Save for the aircraft purportedly transferred to the Bank and any asset in respect of which \nthe Bank’s ownership has been successfully challenged in Ukrainian proceedings . \n18  RAREP, ¶ 27F.8.  \n19  Order of Mr Justice M ann dated 26 June 2020, ¶ 15(2).  \n20  Order of Mr Justice Trower dated 25 June 2021, ¶¶ 21(a) and (b).  \n21  D1 RRAD, ¶¶ 41(6) to (6A).  \n22  The intermediary loans are loans that the Bank alleges were made to companies owned \nand/or controlled by the First and Second Defendants, for which the proceeds were used \nto repay Relevant Loans for the purpose of disguising the Misappr"}

Subsequently, in its financial statements \nfor 2018, the Bank provided restated – and significantly lower – values as at \n31 December 2016 for various assets, including the  Transferred Assets. The \n2018 financial statements were given an unqualified audit opinion by the \nindependent auditors.  \nContemporaneous third -party valuations  \n1.23 As I explain in more detail in Section 3, for each of the Transferred Assets, several \nthird -party valuations were prepared around the relevant times (and separately \nfrom this litigation).

This \nwork included performing a “ desk [top]  review of the fair value of acquired tangible assets \nbased on valuer valuations ” – including some of the Transferred Assets  (EY Report \n(PB0092834_00001 _English), page 131).  \n28  Exhibit M B-A1: Letter of instruction, ¶¶ 5.1 to 5.3.  \n29  The remaining Transferred Assets are the subjects of the reports of Mr Paul Thomas and \nMs Olga Razzhivina, each dated 24 November 2021.  \n30  Exhibit MB -A10: IVSC, International Valuation Standards 2013, ¶ 29 . \nD19/1/10\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 11 \n 1.26 As noted, the Transferred Assets were transferred to t he Bank between March \nand October 2016, with the relevant date differing by asset. For simplicity, I have \nadopted a single valuation date (as opposed to having different valuation dates \nfor the different assets, depending on their respective dates of trans fer). More \nspecifically, I have adopted a valuation date of 1 July 2016 (the “ Valuation Date ”), \nas that is approximately the mid -point of the period over which the assets were \ntransferred to the Bank.

Table 2 -1 below summarises the values I calculate for \nthe different asset types, and compares these with the values pleaded by the \nDefendants, the Original 2016 Values (which were not accepted by the Bank’s \nauditors) and the Restated 2016 Values (which were accepted by the Bank’s \nauditors).  \nTable 2-1: Comparison of values attributed to different asset ty pes (UAH m illion ) \nAsset type  Pleaded by the \nDefendants   Original 2016 \nValues  Restated 2016 \nValues  My value  \nPetrol station s 6,341  6,341  1,852  1,869 \nOil storage \nfacilit ies 5,685  5,685  312 521 \nHotels  2,06 7 2,06 7 1,099 1,32 4 \nOffice buildings  534 534 406 369 \nTotal  14,627 14,627  3,669 4,083 \nSource: Appendix 3 , paragraphs  2.26  and 2.28 , and  Tables 2 -2, 2-4, and 2 -5. \n2.2 As can be seen from Table 2 -1 above, the values that I calculated are broadly \nconsistent with the Restated 2016 Values overall , and materially lower than the \namo unts pleaded by the Defendants.  \n2.3 As I explain in Section 3, some of the Transferred Assets were leased out shortly \nafter their transfer to the Bank. I have valued the Transferred Assets on an \nunencumbered basis. It is  the Bank’s case that the leases were ma de on \ndisadvantageous and non -commercial terms. On that basis, the value of the \nTransferred Assets would be lower (and possibly substantially lower) if valued \nwith these leases in place instead of on an unencumbered basis.  \nPetrol stations  \n2.4 I have been instr ucted to value 246 petrol stations located in Ukraine that were \ntransferred to the Bank between March 2016 and September 2016  (the \n“Petrol  Stations ”). As explained in Section 1, I value the Petrol Stations (and other \nTransferred Assets) as at 1 July 2016.  \nD19/1/14\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 15 \n 2.5 The Petrol Stations were originally recognised on the Bank’s 2016 balance sheet at \nUAH 6.3bn.

In preparing the Original PS Reports , the valuers relied on \nhistorical operational data provided prior to the nationalisation of the Bank  \n(albeit, different reports rely on different historical data). In preparing the \nRestated PS Reports, the valuer who valued the majority of the Petrol Stations \n(Volyn Expert) relied on fuel sales volumes from the results of field studies and \nestimates from  comparable petrol stations.32 \n2.7 I have been unable to validate the historical operational data provided to the \noriginal valuers by the Bank (based on information from the “ enterprise -\nowners ”),33 including historical sales volumes. Alternative reference points that I \nhave reviewed, including average sales volumes data provided by “ Ukrstat ” (the \nnational statistics service of Ukraine), indicate that the volumes underlying the \nRestated PS Reports ar e more likely to be reliable.  \n2.8 More generally, the Bank’s independent auditors concluded that they did not \nhave sufficient appropriate evidence as to the fair value of the Transferred Assets \n(including the Petrol Stations) in the year they were transferred . These values \nwere based on the Original PS Reports. The auditors did accept the values in the \nRestated PS Reports. That may also indicate that the volume assumptions applied \nin the latter are to be preferred to those applied in the former.  \n2.9 I therefore va lue the Petrol Stations by reference to the fuel sales volumes for \n2016 provided in the Restated PS Reports (on the basis that the volumes data \nadopted in  the Restated PS Reports appears more reliable).  \n \n32  It is not clear how the other valuer (Expert+) derived their volumes. However, they are \nsimila r to the Volyn Expert volumes and other reference points.  \n33  The Original PS Reports prepared by UCE and Veritas state that information was ultimately \nprovided by the “ enterprise -owners ”. The Original PS Report prepared by BT only states \nthat information was provided by the Bank.  \nD19/1/15\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 16 \n 2.10 I assess the value of the Petrol Stations to be UAH 1.9bn. In Table 2 -2 below, I \ncompare these values with the Original 2016 Values and Restated 2016 Values for \nthe Petrol Stations . My average value per Petrol Station is c. 71%  lower than the \nOriginal 2016 Values.   \nTable 2-2: Comparison of Petrol Stations valuations  \n  \n  Units  Original \n2016 Valu es Restated  \n2016  Valu es My \nvaluation  \nTotal valu e UAH m 6,341 1,852  1,869  \nAverage per Petrol \nStation  UAH m  25.8 7.5 7.6 \nSource: Table 4-9. \n2.11 As explained in Appendix  10, I have  also considered the sales prices of two Petrol \nStations sold by the Bank at auctions in June 2020 and July  2020.

This results in a value of UAH 5.0bn, or an \naverage of UAH 20.2m per station, which  is 22% lower than the Original 2016 \nValues.36 This difference arises because, even if the fuel sales volumes in the \nOriginal PS Reports are assumed to be accurate, those reports include a number \nof other assumptions (for example, domestic fuel price forec asts) which in my \nview are inappropriate.  \nOil storage facilities  \n2.14 There are 72 oil storage facilities (“ OSF”) which are part of the Transferred Assets \nand relevant to my valuation.  \n2.15 The value of an OSF depends on, inter alia , the condition and status of the asset at \nthe date  of assessment . However, there is limited information available from the \ndisclosed documents and publicly available sources in respect of  the condition and \nstatus of the OSFs . As a result, there is significant uncertainty regarding the  status \nof the OSFs to be valued  as at the Valuation Date .  \n2.16 I have been provided with valuation reports which underlie : \n(1) the OSFs’ Original 2016 Values , and which assume that all of the OSFs were \noperational; and  \n(2) the OSFs’ Restated 2016 Values , and which st ate that at least 71 of the OSFs \nwere not operational at the time that the valuations were prepared in 2019 \n— and value all of the OSFs assuming that they either:   \n(a) were non -operational derelict sites; or   \n(b) required remedial expenditure to return them to operation.  \n \n35  A sensitivity analysis determines how financial model outputs vary with changes in inputs.  \n36  The 2 1% difference is due to my adoption of: ( i) a different valuation methodology to the \nUCE Original PS Cap report ; (ii) a lower discount rate; ( iii) lower fuel price forecasts; and \n(iv) an adjustment to constrain the terminal year return on new invested capital . \nD19/1/17\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 18 \n 2.17 Other contemporaneous documents also indicate that at least some of the OSFs \nwere not operational  (including at the time of  the transfer  of the OSFs to the \nBank) , such as a letter by the NBU to the Bank in July 2016 which states that some \nof the  OSFs had not been operational for a long time .37 The OSFs’ Original 2016 \nValues appear likely, therefore, to have been prepared on the erroneous \nassumption that the OSFs were operational, and may be overstated . \n2.18 Given the uncertainty regarding the status o f the OSFs and the limited \ninformation available, I cannot  use a discounted cash flow (“ DCF”)38 approach to \nvalue the OSFs.

To value the OSFs, I have therefore relied on the \nprices at which a large subset of the OSFs were subsequently sold at auction . \n2.19 The auctions of 42 of these 72 OSFs were completed  between July 2019 and \nOctober  2021. I consider it reasonable to assume that the results of these \nauctions reflect the market value of each OSF as at the  date of each auction. \nHowever, the COVID -19 pandemic may have affected the transaction prices of the \nauctions in 2020 and 2021. In my analysis, therefore, I rely only on the transaction \nprices for the 23 OSFs which were sold at auction in 2019.  \n2.20 I use thes e auction prices to:  \n(1) value the 23 OSFs sold in 2019; and  \n(2) calculate the price per unit capacity multiple implied by these sales. I then \napply an uplift to this multiple and use the uplifted multiple to value the \nremaining 49 OSFs (i.e., the 19 OSFs sold at auction in 2020 and 2021 and \nthe 30 retained OSFs) . I apply an uplift  because m y review of the \ndocuments provided to me suggests that the OSFs sold in 2019 were likely \nto be less valuable than the remaining OSFs. I calculate this premium by \ncompari ng the Restated 2016  Value s per unit of capacity  in respect of :  \n(a) the OSFs sold at auction in 2019; and  \n(b) the remaining OSFs . \n \n37  PB0365697_00001 _English . \n38  I discuss the DCF approach in Appendix 4 of my Share Pledges Report.  \n39  The Comparables Approach is a valuation approach where the value of the target \ncompany or asset is inferred from a comparison with the observed characteristics of \nsimilar companies or assets  (see Appendix 4 of my Share Pledges Report for further \ndetails).  \nD19/1/18\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 19 \n 2.21 My valuation  of the OSFs is materially lower than the OSFs’ Original 2016  Value s \nbut higher than the ir Restated 2016  Value s, as show n in Table 2-4 below .  \nTable 2-4: My  valuation of the OSFs (UAH m illion ) \nType of \nassets  Count  Original \n2016 \nValue s Restated \n2016 \nValues Auction \nvalue  My \nvaluation  \nSold at \nauction \n(2019)  23 1,113  29 80 80 \nSold at \nauction \n(2020 and \n2021)  19 855 73 43 133 \nRetained  30 3,717  210 N/A 307 \nTotal  72 5,685  312 N/A 521 \nSource: Table 5 -7. \n2.22 My valuation is subject to important limitations, including that it relies on \ninformation that was not known or knowable as at the Valuation Date, and it \nassumes that the OSFs’ value, condition and status did not change materially \nbetween the Valuation Dat e and the dates of the auctions in 2019. Nevertheless, I \nconsider the approach I have adopted to be reasonable, and a suitable  approach \ngiven the very limited information available to me . \nOffice Buildings  \n2.23 I have valued two office buildings – located at 10 Muzeinyi Lane , Kyiv (the “ Kyiv \nOffice ”) and at 32 Naberezhna Peremo hy Str eet, Dnipro (the “ Dnipro Office ”) – \nwhich I refer to as the “ Office Buildings ”.

For the portion of the hotel used as \nguest accommodation, I consider profit, revenue and value per room multiples \nderived from other hotel companies. For the portion of the hotel rented out as \noffice space, I rely on the price per square metre of other office space in a similar \nlocation within Kyiv.  \n2.33 I have relatively limited infor mation about the historical financial and operational \nperformance of either hotel prior to the Valuation D ate.

Two of the most significant \ndifferences betwe en the Veritas valuation and my own are that:  \n(1) Veritas attributed a value of UAH 365m to the hotel’s staff building and the \nland on which it was located, in addition to the value it attributed to the \nmain hotel building. Veritas assumed for these purpos es that the staff \nbuilding could be converted to guest accommodation without affecting the \noperation of the main hotel building. It is unclear on what basis Veritas \nmade this assumption. I attribute no separate value to the staff building \nbecause I have se en no analysis indicating that a conversion of the staff \nbuilding was feasible alongside the ongoing operation of the main hotel, or \nthat it was economic al given any conversion costs and  the effect on \noperating costs; and  \n(2) I assume that the owner of Hot el Zirka would need to pay tax on its profits, \nwhereas Veritas did not, which reduces my valuation by 18%.  \nD19/1/23\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 24 \n 2.36 I discuss other differences between my valuation and that of Veritas later in this \nreport.  \n2.37 EY reviewed the Veritas report as part of its work  for th e EY Report .

I disagree with the \nvaluation analyses performed by UCE:  \n(1) UCE based its overall conclusion on its comparables analysis. However:  \n(a) the comparable  propertie s it used were not all exclusively operated \nas hotels; and  \n(b) the valuation metric it used was value per square metre of floor area. \nI consider it more appropriate to value a hotel by reference to \nmetrics more closely linked to the hotel’s profitability such as its \nprofits, revenue or number of rooms; and  \n(2) whe n considering the hotel’s profitability in its alternative valuation \napproach , based on the hotel’s forecasted income and expenditure  (the \n“Income Approach ”), UCE adopted assumptions which: (i) do not appear to \nhave been grounded in the actual performance of the hotel; and (ii) \nmaterially overstated its profitability — for instance assuming an occupancy \nlevel of 90% without any apparent basis, despite this  assumed  occupancy \nbeing materially higher than previously achieved by Hotel Mir and typical \noccupancy rates for hotels in Kyiv.  \nD19/1/24\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Bezant in BL-2017 -000665  | 25 \n 2.40 The UCE report was one of two valuations of Hotel Mir that EY reviewed.

The First Defendant has pleaded a value for each of \nthe Transferred Assets in D1 RRFI 0721: Annex A .  \nD19/1/26\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 27 \n \n \n \n 3.4 The values pleaded in D1 RRFI 0721: Annex A a re clear for most of the assets, \nbecause the annex contains the asset name and an attributed value. For a subset \nof the assets (which includes five aircraft, one office, and one hotel), Annex A \neither does not include the asset name, or attributes a value to an asset and then \napplies deductions to that value. Using the information in Schedule 2  and Annex A \nI have deduced the pleaded values of these assets.47, 48 \n3.5 In Table 3-1 below, I summarise the values that the First Defendant pleads for the \nTransferred Assets, as aggregated between the different asset types. I also show \nthe proportion of the total amount that accords to each asset  type . \n \n47  For the aircraft, I matched the ID numbers of the loan agreements that each aircraft was \npurported to repay in Schedule 2, with the amounts in Annex A that were repaid a gainst \nthose loan agreement numbers (D1 RRFI 0720: Annex A, pages 134 and 135 and \nD1 RRAD:  Schedule 2, pages 3, 9, and 11). The total pleaded value I deduced for the five \naircraft is USD 161.7m, which is consistent with Mr Thompson’s assessment (Mr \nThompso n’s Report, ¶ 4.30 ).  \nFor the Airbus 321 and Boeing 737 -300, Schedule 2 indicates that the aircraft repay one \nloan each (of USD 16.6m and USD 38.0m, respectively), and Annex A shows one \ntransaction repaying each of those loans. I have taken USD 16.6m and U SD 38.0m as the \npleaded values of those aircraft.  \nFor the Boeing 767 -300 25536 , Schedule 2 suggests that the transfer of the aircraft repays \ntwo loans of USD 33.0m and UAH 65.9m. Annex A matches Schedule 2 for the USD 33.0m \nloan. For the UAH 65.9m loan, A nnex A suggests repayments of UAH 65.9m plus UAH 1.1m \nof interest (equal to UAH 67.0m). I have taken the pleaded amount to be USD 33.0m, plus \nUAH 67.0m. This equals a total of USD 35.7m.  \nFor Boeing 767 -300 25533 , Schedule 2 suggests that the transfer of t he aircraft repays a \nloan of USD 30.0m. Annex A suggests repayments of USD 30.0m plus USD 2.0m of interest \n(equal to USD 32.0m). I have taken the pleaded amount to be USD 32.0m.  \nFor the Embraer 145 , Schedule 2 suggests that the transfer of the aircraft re pays two loans \nof USD 37.0m and UAH  59.6m. Annex A matches Schedule 2 for the USD 37.0m loan. For \nthe UAH 59.6m loan, Annex A suggests repayments of UAH 59.6m plus UAH 1.0m of \ninterest (equal to UAH 60.6m). I have taken the pleaded amount to be USD 37.0m, plus \nUAH 60.6m. This equals a total of USD  39.4m.  \n48  For Hotel Zirka and the Dnipro Office, Annex A (pages 45 and 49) shows a value for the \npledged asset, followed by one or more ‘corrections’ or ‘reversals’. I understand that the \n‘corrections’ or ‘reversals’ relate to downward adjustments to the value of the assets after \nthey were originally recorded in the Bank’s transactional data. Therefore, for these two \nassets, I have taken the pleaded amount as the starting value of the pledg ed asset, and \nsubtract the ‘reversals’ and ‘corrections’. Based on this, I have taken the pleaded value for \nHotel Zirka to be UAH 1,617m, and for the Dnipro Office to be UAH  212m.  \nD19/1/27\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 28 \n \n \n \n Table 3-1: Value of Transferred Assets pleaded by the First Defendan"}

EY’s conclusions are set out in the EY \nReport.55 \n3.9 I discuss the EY Report in  detail in  Appendix 4. In summary:  \n(1) EY analysed 391 assets that were transferred to the Bank between March \nand September 2016,56 including many of the Transferred Assets. Based on \nits review of the overall set of 391 assets, EY concluded that their “ value at \ninitial recognition may be overestimated by 20 -37% ”;57 \n(2) the EY Report does not provide individual asset -level information in respect \nof all the assets EY considered.

Accordingly, it is not possible to \ncompare directly the amounts relied on by the Defendants with the values \ncalculated by  EY. However, the Defendants’ values correspond with the \nassessments of  ‘valuer 1’, which EY appeared to reject in preference to the \n(lower) amounts estimated by ‘valuer 2’.61 \n3.10 In short, the EY Report appears to indicate that the Original 2016 Values  are \nsignificantly overstated. Furthermore, that overstatement appears to be \nwidespread across the  full set of assets, rather than isolated to  a small number of \nhigher value assets.62 \nBank’s financial statements  \n3.11 The Bank’s annual financial statements have, at all  relevant times, been stated to \nbe prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  \n(“IFRS ”).63 In 2016, EY was appointed as the Bank’s independent auditor.  \n \n58  Appendix 3.  \n59  See footnotes 455 and 456. The other real estate asset I am valuing is Hotel Mir.  EY \nconsidered that it had insufficient information to value Hotel Mir . \n60  Appendix 3.  \n61  As I explain in Appendix 4, EY concluded that the method used in 'Report 2' was more \nappropriate for the valuation of the oil storage facilities  than the me thod used in 'Report \n1'. \n62  For instance, for 86% of the 228 EY Valued Transferred Petrol Stations, the values \nestimated by EY are at least 10% lower  than amounts relied on by the Defendants.  \n63  See note 3 in the Bank’s financial statements for 2016, 2017,  2018 and 2019 (Exhibit MB -\nA117: PrivatBank consolidated financial statements 2016 ; Exhibit MB -A118:  PrivatBank \nconsolidated financial statements 2017 ; Exhibit MB -A119: PrivatBank consolidated \nfinancial statements 2018 ; and Exhibit MB -A120:  PrivatBank consolidated financial \nstatements 201 9). \nD19/1/30\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 31 \n \n \n \n 2016 financial statements  \n3.12 The Bank’s financial statements for 2016 were published in around May 2017.64 \nThe Transferred Assets were included on the Bank’s balance sheet at \n31 December 2016 at the amounts for which they were initially recognised on \ntheir receipt by the Bank,65 but EY’s audit opinion was qualified in respect of the \nBank’s financial statements for a number of reasons,66 including that it was unable \nto obtain sufficient appropriate evidence in respect of the fair value of property \nand collateral transferred to the Bank in 2016.

I have valued the Petrol Stations on a \nstand -alone basis, rather than as part of a vertically integrated business, \nconsistent with the definition of market value that I am instructed to adopt.135 \nThis is also consistent with the approach taken i n all of the contemporaneous \nvaluation reports  of the Petrol Stations , including all the Original PS Reports on \nwhich the Defendant s rely. \n \n134  D1 RRAD, ¶ 15(2) . \n135  ¶ 1.25 . \n01020304050607080\nBT Original\nPS ReportUCE Original\nPS DCF\n ReportUCE Original\nPS Cap\nReportVeritas\nOriginal PS\nReportEY Report Volyn Expert\nRestated PS\nReportMy\nvaluationD1 RRAD\nD19/1/58\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 59 \n \n \n \n 4.51 As is the case in all contemporaneous valuation reports I have reviewed, I apply an \nIncome Approach, which can involv e DCF analysis or a capitalisation approach.   \n4.52 DCF analysis involves the estimation of cash flows for an explicit forecast period \nuntil the business is considered stable, after which a terminal value is calculated. \nThe terminal value captures cash flows int o perpetuity based on a long -term \ngrowth rate. Cash flows are discounted back to the valuation date using a \ndiscount rate, commonly the weighted average cost of capital (“ WACC ”).  \n4.53 The capitalisation approach alternatively considers the business to already be \nstable and therefore does not include an explicit forecast period. Instead, a \ncapitalisation rate is applied to a single year of representative earnings, which \naccounts for earnings into perpetuity. This can be thought of as equivalent to the \nterminal v alue calculation of a DCF analysis.  \n4.54 Of the contemporaneous valuation reports I have reviewed, the BT Original PS \nReport and UCE Original PS DCF Report use DCF analysis, whereas the remainder \nuse the capitalisation approach.  \n4.55 One of the main inputs underpinn ing the value of a petrol stations is oil prices. As \nat my Valuation Date, oil prices were forecast to change significantly over the \nshort term, before stabilising. I have therefore relied on DCF analysis as it is better \nsuited to allow for these forecast changes than a capitalisation approach.  \n4.56 I have not separately been provided with specific operational or financial data \nrelating to the Petrol Stations.

A significant portion of the difference between the  Original and \nRestated 2016 Values for the Petrol Stations can be attributed to assumptions of \nthe fuel sales volumes (put simply, the Original PS Reports rely on higher fuel sales \nvolumes which result in higher valuations; the Restated PS Reports rely on lower \nfuel sales volumes which result in lower valuations).  \n4.59 To assist the Court, I have considered various reference points and identified  \nwhich volume assumption they  indicate is  more likely to be reliable. The reference \npoints I have considered include:  \n(1) the UCE and BT Original PS Reports, which are both purportedly based on \nhistorical volumes provided by the Bank and contain contradictory historical \nvolumes. This suggests that there may be internal inconsistencies in the \nhistorical volume data provid ed to the valuers by the Bank prior to \nnationalisation;  \n(2) the decision of Business Partners LLC and S ynex  to disregard the historical \nvolumes data provided by the Bank in favour of different volume \nassumptions, in their 2017 valuations of some of the Pet rol Stations.137 This \nsuggests that Business Partners LLC and S ynex  did not consider the \nhistorical volume data provided by the Bank prior to nationalisation to be \nreliable;  \n(3)  data on fuel sale s volumes provided by Ukrstat, the national statistics \nservi ce of Ukraine,138 which suggests that across Ukraine, average fuel sales \nvolumes per station are closer to the volumes used in the Restated PS \nReports;  \n \n137  Expert+ and Expertgarant also appear to disregard the volumes data provided by the Bank, \nalthough it is unclear how their volume inputs are derived.  \n138  Exhibit MB -B9: Ukrstat, About the site, accessed 17 November 2021 . \nD19/1/60\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 61 \n \n \n \n (4) granular data  on fuel sales volumes for the largest petrol station network \noperators in Ukraine, in 2016.139 For the p etrol stations most comparable to \nthose I am instructed to value, being those operated by PJSC Ukrnafta \n(“Ukrnafta ”) and the Privat group  (which are both non -premium petrol \nstation brands) , average fuel sales volumes per station are closer to the \nvolumes u sed in the Restated PS Reports (and all operators imply fuel sales \nvolumes lower than those used in the Original PS Reports);140 and \n(5) total 2016 fuel sales volumes for the Petrol Stations as a proportion of \nthose operated by the Privat group, of which I assume the Petrol Stations \nare a subset.

Although the \nvolumes underlying the Expert+ Restated PS Reports and the Volyn Expert \nRestated PS Report are largely consistent, I am unable to determine how the \nExpert+ volumes have been  derived. Therefore, for each Petrol Station, I assess \nrevenues using volumes underlying the Volyn Expert Restated PS Reports,142 and \nregion and network -specific prices gathered from Vseazs .com (“ Vseazs ”), a \nprovider of Ukrainian fuel prices.143  \n4.67 As in the UCE and Veritas Original Reports, I forecast domestic fuel prices based \non the forecast change in the global price of Brent crude oil converted into UAH at \nthe prevailing exchange rate.  \n4.68 Unlike UCE and Veritas, I consider that only a portion of t he change in Brent price \n(in percentage terms) will flow through to domestic fuel prices, rather than the \nfull change. My assessment is based on the contribution of raw material prices to \ndomestic fuel prices and articles published by the Federal Reserve B ank of St Louis \nand the  European Central Bank  (“ECB”), which indicate a 50% pass -through rate is \nreasonable.144 \n \n142  For Petrol Stations either: (i) valued in the Expert+ Restated PS Reports (47 Petrol \nStations); or (ii) valued in the V olyn Expert Restated PS Report, but where I am missing fuel \nsales volumes (six Petrol Stations), I use the average volumes for Petrol Stations with the \nsame number of pumps in the Volyn Expert Restated PS Report.  If I were to use the \nvolumes underlying the  Expert+ Restated PS Reports for the 47 Petrol Stations valued in \nthose reports, my overall valuations would be 3.3%  lower.

Therefore, I assume that in the long -run the return on new invested \ncapital (“ RONIC ”) will reach 18.5%, representing my assessment of the cost of \ncapital plus a premium of 1% .148 The changes that result in the RONIC reaching \nthis level could manifest in a number of ways, for example through reduced \nmargins , increased capital expenditure,  or an increase in working capital. For \ncomputational convenience, I implement it by assumin g capital expenditure will \nincrease annually until the RONIC has reached 18.5%.  \n4.74 To account for cash flows into perpetuity, I assess a terminal value for each Petrol \nStation by applying a terminal growth rate to cash flows in the final year of the \nexplicit forecast period.

These OSFs were \ntransferred to the Bank between March 2016 and September 2016.154 \n5.2 The value of the OSFs depends significantly on the condition and status of the \nassets as at the date of assessment . The valuation  report that  underl ies the OSFs’  \nOriginal 2016 Values assume s that all the OSFs were  operational and value s them \naccordingly. The valuation reports that underlie the  OSFs’ Restated 2016 Values \nstate that at least 71 of  the OSFs were not  operational and value the OSFs \nassuming that they:  \n(1) would remain non -operational derelict sites; or  \n(2) could be returned to operation but required remedial expenditure to do so.   \n5.3 There are o ther documents  that indicate that at least some of the OSFs were no t \noperational  (including at the time of the transfer of the OSFs to the Bank) , such as \na letter by the NBU  to the Bank  in July 2016 which states that some of the OSFs  \nhad not been operational for an extended period.155 Accordingly, there is \nsignificant unce rtainty regarding the operational status of the OSFs  as at my \nValuation Date  (including whether it was economical to return any non -\noperational OSFs to operation, and whether the highest and best use of these \nsites was as operational OSFs).  \n5.4 Moreover, the c ontemporaneous information available to me is limited. There is \nno information available on the OSFs’ historical or forecast financial performance \nwhich might assist my valuation. Accordingly, I cannot use a DCF approach to \nvalue the OSFs.

In my \nanalysis, however, I rely only on the transac tion prices for the 23 OSFs which were \nsold at auction  in 2019 , because the COVID -19 pandemic may have affected the \ntransaction prices of the auctions in 2020 and 2021 . \n5.7 I use these auction prices to:  \n(1) value the 23 OSFs sold in 2019; and  \n(2) calculate the price per unit capacity multiple implied by these sales, apply \nan uplift to this multiple and use the uplifted multiple to value the \nremaining 49 OSFs (i.e., the  19 OSFs sold at auction in 2020 and 2021  and \nthe 30 retained OSFs ).

I then discuss the various valuations of the OSFs set \nout in the contemporaneous valuation reports available to me and the results of \nauctions of a subset of the OSFs through which the Bank sold these assets \nbetween 2019 and 2021. Finally, I describe my valuation approach and results \ngiven the information available.  \nOverview of the OSFs  \n5.10 An OSF is an industrial facility that stores oil prod ucts and can perform \ntranshipment, import or distribution operations. It carries out operations such \nas:156 \n(1) reception of oil products delivered in tankers and pipelines;  \n(2) storage of oil products in tanks;  \n(3) release of large volumes of oil products in tankers a nd pipelines;  \n(4) release of small volumes of oil products to consumers via containers; and  \n(5) heating of solidifying and viscous oil products in tanks, tankers and \npipelines.  \n5.11 The value of an OSF depends significantly on its condition and status as at the \ndate of  assessment . In particular, its value depends on : \n(1) whether it is  operational : \n(a) if it is operational , its value will depend  on the expected cash flows, \nincluding sales volume s of oil, from the OSF ; \n(b) if it is not, its value will depend  on: ( i) whether it require s remedial \nexpenditure to return it to operation (and whether it is economical to \nmake such expenditure) ; or ( ii) the potential scrap value or alternative \nuses, if any, of the site at which the asset is located if it is derelict or \necon omically obsolete;   \n(2) the capacity of the storage tanks of the OSF; and  \n(3) the value of the underlying land.  \n \n156  PB0273778_00001 _English, page 22.  \nD19/1/72\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report"}

Accordingly, it is not \npossible to directly compare the amounts assessed  by EY to my valuation of the \nOSFs, or to the Original 2016 Value s and Restated 2016 Value s of the 72 OSFs \nrelevant to my valuation.194 \n \n188  For three of the 42 OSFs sold at auction (being those located at “ Kirovograd, \nMurmanskaya St, 39а ”, “Zhytomyr, Kievskoye shosse, 4/2 ” and “ Kirovograd district, \nGruzskoye village, Maloviskovskoye shosse, 1а ”), the auction proceeds were higher than \nthe Original 2016 Values, by between UAH 0.3m and UAH 2.2 m each ( Appendix 13 ). \n189  EY Report, pages 239 to 244.  \n190  EY Report, page 240.  \n191  BT OSF Report, page 2; and EY Report, page 240.  \n192  Table 5-2.  \n193  ¶ A4.26 . \n194  ¶ A4.27 . \nD19/1/79\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 80 \n \n \n \n 5.32 Nevertheless, EY concluded that the amounts set out in the BT OSF Report ( relied \non by the Defendants ) are overstated .

The \nauctions in 2020 and 2021 occurred during the COVID -19 pandemic.240 I do not \nknow whether the prices for the OSFs which were sold at  auction in 2020 and \n2021 were affected by the COVID -19 pandemic, and if so, the magnitude of the \nimpact. To reduce the risk of adopting assumptions that are inappropriate as at \nmy Valuation Date , in my analysis I rely only on the transaction prices for the 23 \nOSFs which were sold at auction in 2019.241 These 23 OSFs account for 30% of the \ntotal capacity across the 72 OSFs I am valuing.242 \n5.62 I use these transaction prices to:  \n(1) value the 23 OSFs sol d in 2019; and  \n(2) calculate the price per unit capacity multiple implied by these sales, based \non capacity data in the BT OSF Report.243 I then use the median multiple \nimplied by these sales (uplifted for a premium, as I describe in the next \nsubsection) t o value the other 49 OSFs (i.e., the retained OSFs and the OSFs \nsold at auction in 2020 and 2021) .244 I use the median multiple because, as I \nexplained above, there are five outliers for which the multiples were \n \n240  Ukraine recorded its first ca se of COVID -19 on 3 March 2020, and a state of emergency \nwas declared in Kyiv and a few other regions in Ukraine on 20 March 2020 due to COVID -\n19.

I consider it reasonable to use \nthe auction prices reflected in this 30% sample size to calculate the  value of the remaining \nOSFs (which represent 70% of the capacity of the OSFs relevant to my valuation) \n(Appendix 13 ). \n243  As I explained above, I use information on OSF capacity from the BT OSF Report, rather \nthan the capacity figures in the Restated OSF Reports. In Appendix 14 , I set out an \nalternative analysis based on capacity  data from the Restated OSF Reports ( for the 60 \nOSFs with capacity data in these reports, and data from the BT OSF Report for the other \n12 OSFs ).   \n244  The price per unit capacity is a metric commonly  used to value OSFs. Certain of the \nvaluation reports I h ave reviewed relied on such multiples in their own valuations  of the \nOSFs.  See, for example, PB0365507_00001 _English, pages 43 and 51 to 55; \nPB0285571_00001 , pages 48 and 60 to 64; and Exhibit MB -B8: Partial translations of \ndisclosed documents, pdf page s 584, 596 to 600.  \nD19/1/91\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 92 \n \n \n \n considerably higher than those of the other O SFs.245 \n5.63 As I explained above, the value of the OSFs depends significantly on the condition \nand status of these assets. Nevertheless:  \n(1) my valuation approach based on the transaction prices of these auctions \n(and the multiples implied by the auctions) does no t require me to \ndetermine the operational status of the OSFs. This is because the \ntransaction prices reflect the condition and status of the OSFs sold, \nincluding whether their highest and best use was as operational OSFs or as \nan alternative use (albeit, a s I explain below, I assume that the condition \nand status of the OSFs did not change significantly between the Valuation \nDate and the dates of the auctions in 2019); and  \n(2) as I explained above, the Restated OSF Reports  and other documents I have \nreviewed ind icate that most of the OSFs ( at least  71 out of 72 OSFs relevant \nto my valuation ) were not operational at the time that the valuations were \nprepared in 2019. I therefore consider it reasonable to use a price per unit \ncapacity multiple implied by the OSFs sold at auction  in 2019 to value the \nremaining OSFs (I assume that the highest and best use of the OSFs sold at \nauction  in 2019 as reflected in the auction values – whether it was as \noperational OSFs or as an alternative use – applies on average across the \nremaining OSFs).246 \n5.64 Further, as I explain above, I am instructed that the OSFs that were sold  at auction \nwere sold on an unencumbered basis .

As I explain in Appendix 14 :  \n(1) the Original 2016  Value s and Restated 2016 Value s are both typically lower , \nper unit of capacity , for those OSFs  that were sold at auction  in 2019 than \nthe remaining OSFs;  \n(2) for a subset of 4 5 OSFs  covered by a restated valuation report prepared by \nAE, the report indicates that the  OSFs  that were sold at auction in 2019 and \nthat we re covered in the report (20 OSFs)  were  typically in a worse state of \nrepair than the remaining OSFs (25 OSFs) ; and  \n(3) data in the BT OSF Report underlying the Original 2016 Value s indicates \nthat in 2015 the OSFs sold at auction in 2019 typically operated at lower \nutilisation than the remaining OSFs.  \n5.66 As a result, I consider that it is appropriate to value the remaining OSFs  at a \npremium, on a per unit capacity basis, to the OSFs sold at auction in 2019 . I \ntherefore apply an uplift to the price per unit capacity multiple implied by the \nauctions  in 2019  in order to value the remaining OSFs . I calculate t his premium by \ncomparing the Restated 2016 Value s per capacity  in respect of :248 \n(1) the OSFs sold at auction in 2019;  and  \n(2) the remaining  OSFs.  \n5.67 As set out in Table 5-6 below, for the 23 OSFs sold at auction in 2019, the median \ncapacity multiple implied by the Restated 2016 Value s is lower than the median \nmultiple implied by the Restated 2016 Value s for the remaining 49 OSFs.  \n \n248  I rely on the premium implied by the Restated 2016 Values per capacity, rather than by \nthe Original 2016 Values per capacity, because: (i) the Restated 2016 Values of the OSFs \nsold at auction in 2019 are closer to the prices achieved in the auctions than t he Original \n2016 Values; and (ii) EY concluded that the Original 2016 Values were materially \noverstated.  \nD19/1/93\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 94 \n \n \n \n Table 5-6: Value per unit capacity of the OSFs according to the Restated 2016 \nValue s (UAH/ton ne) \nType of assets  Median Restated 2016 \nValues  per unit capacity  \nSold at auction  (2019)  149 \nSold at auction  (2020 and 2021) and retained  849 \nDifference (rounded)  470% \nSource: Appendix 13 .  \n5.68 Based on the R estated 2016 Values, the median implied multiple for the 49 OSFs \nnot sold in 2019 is 470% higher than the median multiple for the 23 OSFs sold at \nauction in 2019. I have been unable to determine the reasons for this difference.  \n5.69 However, I consider it reasonable to assume that the difference is due to \ndifferences in the fundamental characteri stics of the OSFs  and that these  \ndifferences  did not change materially between 2016 and 2019  (for example, the \ntechnical condition of the OSFs) .

However, I have also \nconsidered additional valuation benchmarks from public ly available information \nto form my own view on an appropriate valuation range. My review of each of the \nvaluation reports for the Kyiv Office is set out in Appendix 15  and for the Dnipro \nOffice is set out i n Appendix 16 . \n6.3 I understand that both offices  were transferred to the Bank on 6 June 2016. For \nsimplicity, and to be consistent with my other asset valuat ions, I have performed \nmy valuations as at 1 July 2016.254 The valuation reports upon which I rely adopt  \ndifferent valuation dates around this time, but my valuation is not sensitive to the \nprecise date .  \nSummary of my conclusions  \n6.4 The information available to me indicates that the values at which the Kyiv Office \nand the Dnipro Office were transferred to the Bank on 6 June 2016 were \nsignificantly overstated , as described below. As explained in Section 3 above, t he \nrestated  amounts as at 31 December 2016 were reported in the Bank’s financial \nstatements for 2018  and were not qualified by EY indicating that EY, as an \nindependent auditor, was satisfied that the restated amounts as at 31 December \n2016  were not materially misstated . \n \n253  D1 RRAD: Schedule 2.

This was the value \nrecorded on the Bank’s balance sheet for the year ended 31 December 2016.255 \nThe Restated 2016 Value was about 40% lower, at UAH 193.7m.  \n6.6 Based on the evidence available to me, I value the Kyiv Of fice between \nUAH  186.3m and UAH 202.0m , excluding VAT , as at 1 July 2016. I have adopted \nthe mid -point of this range of UAH 194.2m as my valuation. Consequently, I \nconsider that the Original 2016 Value of the Kyiv Office appears to be significantly \noverstated but the Restated 2016 Value appears reasonable and consistent with \nmy valuation.  \nThe Dnipro Office  \n6.7 The value  of the Dnipro Office as initially recognised by the Bank was \nUAH  453.0m. That value was reduced on 26 September 2016 by about 50%, to \nUAH 212.1m  and was the amount included in the 2016 financial statements (the \nOriginal 2016 Value) .256 This amount was not subsequently restated in the 2018 \nfinancial statements  (that is, i n 2018, the auditors considered that the value \ndetermined on 26 September 2016 was reasonable) . I understand that the \nDefendants plead this Original 2016 Value  of UAH 212.1m.257 Based on the \nevidence available to me, I value the Dnipro Office between UAH 14 7.4m and UAH \n202.6m excluding VAT as at 1 July 2016 . I have adopted the mid -point of this \nrange of UAH 175.0m as my valuation. Consequently,  I consider that  the value  of \nthe Dnipro Office as initially recognised by the Bank appears to be significantly \nover stated , but the Original  2016 Value appears more reasonable, being \napproximately 20% above the mid -point of my valuation  (and approximately \nUAH  10m above the high point of my range) .  \nMethodology  \n6.8 The valuation of office space is performed using similar techniques to those \ndescribed in Appendix 4 of the Share Pledge s Report, i.e. , valuers will typically \nvalue a property based on:  \n(1)  transactions in comparable properties, where the value of the target \ncompany  or asset  is inferred from a compariso n with the observed \n \n255  D1 RRFI 0721: Annex A, page 44.

That is, under a Comparables Approach, the comparable properties’ \nvalues are divided by the office floor space to provide a comparable metric to \napply to the floor space of  the target property. Under the Income Approach, it is \ncommon to forecast future income by reference to a market -based rental rate, \nagain on a per m2 basis.  \n6.10 It is important to ensure that any cost per m2 metric  is calculated and used on a \nconsistent basis.  For example, if a comparable rental figure is calculated based on \nthe gross leasable area (“ GLA”) of the building,259 then this metric must be applied \nto a GLA figure to calculate the implied valuation. Similarly, if the cost per m2 \nmetric is calculated ba sed on the gross floor area (“ GFA ”) of the office,260 then the \nGFA must be used to calculate the implied valuation.  \n6.11 In addition, comparable  prices used for any such analysis must be presented on a \nconsistent basis to reflect whether they are ‘asking prices ’ or ‘realised prices ’, and \nwhether they are inclusive or exclusive of VAT. Adjustments are also made to the \ncost per m2 metrics to reflect differences in the characteristics of the comparable \nand target properties. I describe each of these adjustments furt her below.  \n \n258  Often in the real estate sector, valuations are performed by dividing a company’s \nprojected annual net operating income by a capitalisation rate.  This is equivalent to the \nterminal value part of a DCF, under which one assumes that the annual net  operating \nincome will grow each year in line with a constant annual growth rate. The capitalisation \nrate is equal to the difference between the discount rate used and this constant growth \nrate.  \n259  GLA is the amount of space in a commercial building that c an actually be rented by a \ntenant and thus produce income for the owner of the building (Source: Exhibit MB -B17: \nCREOP, Understanding Commercial Lease Floor Areas).  \n260  GFA is the total area of the building, measured to the external face of the external wa lls. \nThat is, it is the GLA plus the space that is not available for rent (Source: Exhibit MB -B17: \nCREOP, Understanding Commercial Lease Floor Areas).  \nD19/1/100\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 101 \n \n \n \n The difference between asking and realised prices  \n6.12 The comparable property prices presented in the valuation reports, on property \nwebsites or in other sources may  either be asking prices or realised prices.

Adjustments to the valu ation metrics of the comparable assets being \nanalysed are typically made to account for differences to the target asset. Valuers \nwill typically adjust to reflect:  \n(1) the location of the property . Indeed , some areas within a given city may be \nmore in deman d than others and so more valuable . Alternatively, \nproperties in  certain cities will be more valuable than  in others, for example \noffice space in a capital city or other city of significance may be more \nvaluable  than in a regional city;  \n(2) the relative condition or quality of the office space, which might reflect \naspects such as when the building was refurbished  and to what \nspecification, the ability for the floor space to be used effectively, and the \nfacilities within the building;  \n(3) the area of land used;  \n(4) the relative size of the properties in question (i.e. , there is not a direct \nrelationship between th e cost per m2 of a small property and that of a \nlarger property, so an adjustment may be required to reflect this);262 and \n(5) differences between a comparable property’s asking price and the price \nthat might ultimately be expected to be realised.  \n6.15 These adjustments  are typically made by the application of what is commonly \nreferred to as a ‘correction’ or ‘adjustment’ factor to the calculated value per m2 \nderived from each comparable property. In doing so, the valuer seeks to control \nfor differences between t he selection of different comparable properties used.  \n \n262  The formula to make this adjustment is consistent across all the valuation reports I have \nreviewed.  \nD19/1/102\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 103 \n \n \n \n Kyiv Office  \n6.16 In this subsection I first describe the relevant valuation reports provided to me \nand the characteristics of the Kyiv Office set out in these reports.

It is important that \nthey are consistently stated so as to be directly comparable. I have the refore \nconverted the various reference points that I have relied upon into realised price s \nexcluding VAT , so that they are directly comparable.282 \n6.24 To do this, I:  \n(1) reduce asking prices by 15% to reflect the average reduction in asking \nprices compared to those realised;283 and  \n(2) exclude the VAT from the realised prices , which was calculated at 20%  in \nUkraine in 2016.284 \n6.25 This results in average sale prices of office space in effect in Central Core Kyiv in \n2016 ranging between UAH 33,090/m² and UAH 41,814/m ², excluding VAT. I \ntherefore value the Kyiv Office between UAH 186.3m and UAH 235.5m excluding \nVAT, as presented in Table 6-2 below, based on its total floor area of 5, 632m².  \n \n279  I note that the Expert+ 2018 Kyiv Office Report and the VA Kyiv Reports also make a \nmethodologically -similar  downward adjustment to reflect this difference  in area.

It is unclear whether this is the \nmaximum area of the building that can be rented or the occupied lease area. I note that \nthe Colliers 2017 Kyiv Office Report ( discussed below ) states that the GLA of the building is \n4,338m2.  \nD19/1/108\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 109 \n \n \n \n 6.29 I did not rely on UCE’s Income Approach or assumptions because I consider UCE’s \nIncome Approach valuation to be an outlier and its assumptions flawed as:  \n(1) UCE incorrectly considers the monthly rent of UAH 565/m2 as excluding VAT \nwhen in f act it is inclusive of VAT. Correcting for this error would decrease \nthe monthly rent to UAH 470/m2; \n(2) as explained  in paragraph 6.21  above, UCE’s assumptions on th e technical \ncondition of the Kyiv Office is inconsistent with the other valuation reports; \nand \n(3) UCE did not adjust for differences between the comparable buildings and \nthe Kyiv Office other than for bargaining and technical condition.  \n6.30 In addition to the data derived from the CBRE 2016 Kyiv Office Report, the Expert+ \nReport and the Colliers 2017 Kyiv Office Report, I have considered third -party \nreports on the state of the office market in Kyiv in 2016 prepared by CBRE and \nDTZ, both international real esta te firms, and contemporaneous rents of the Kyiv \nOffice as at 1 July 2016.286 As I estimate a range of monthly rents  as at 1 July  2016, \nI only rely on the reference points close to or around 2016.287 \n6.31 This data indicate s that monthly rent  for class B offices located in  the central core \nof Kyiv ranged from UAH 307/m² to UAH 497/m² around mid-2016 , as shown in \nTable 6-3 below .\n \n286  See footnote 204 for a description of CBRE.

As explained further in Appendix 15 , I do not rely on the UCE \n2015 Dnipro Office Report’s inputs because:  \n(1) it incorrectly considers that the adjusted unit prices it estimates exclude \nVAT.

However, according to the Expert+ market analysis presented in \nthe Expert+ 2019 Dnipro Office Report, monthly rents range d from UAH 110/m² \nto UAH 180/m² in 2017  in central  Dnipro  for renovated buildings .309 This \nrepresents around one -third of the monthly rents for offices comparable to the \nKyiv Office, as explained in paragraph 6.31  above . Considering that these two \noffices are located in different cities, one in the capital and one in a large city, I \nconsider such a difference can be expected.  \n6.48 I divide  the Dnipro Office’ s projected annual net post -tax operating income310 by a \ncapitalisation rate of 10.5%, equal to the difference between the post -tax \ndiscount rate of 15.5% presented in Appendix 5  and a constant inflation rate of \n5.0% per annum , consistent with the long -term rate of inflation in Ukraine I rely \non in my assessment of the discount rate.311  \n6.49 In the absence of any further information, I do not update the other assumptions \nin the Kreston 2016 Dnipro Office Report and the Expert+ 2019 Dnipro Office \nReport, namely the vacancy rate and the ratio of operating costs over operating \nincome , and I use them as appropriate ranges of inputs . \n6.50 This provides  a value  for the Dnipro  Office of between UAH 113.1m and \nUAH  202.6m excluding VAT , as presented in Table 6-7 below .312  \n \n309  PB0270908_00001, page 15.  \n310  The Dnipro Office operating in Ukraine, I assume that its owner would be liable to pay \ncorporate tax on profits from 2017 onwards at the rate in effect in Ukraine in 2016, i.e., at \n18%.

Typically, a building’s GLA is smaller than its total \narea. Therefore, using GLA rather than total area in my Income Approach \nvaluation would  reduce my valuation.   \nConclusion  \n6.51 I conclude that the value of the Dnipro Office is between  UAH 147.4m and \nUAH  202.6m excluding VAT as at 1 July 2016 , based on the overlap of both the \nComparables Approach  and the Income Approach presented in Figure 6-2 below. \nUsing the overlap of the two methods, I reduce the valuation uncertainty \nassociated with the valuation. The EY Report’s potential valuation based on \ncertain adjust ments to the valuation reports provided to it indicates a valuation \nrange of between UAH 181 m and UAH  194m. This therefore lies within my \nvaluation range.  \nD19/1/120\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 121 \n \n \n \n 6.52 This indicates  that:  \n(1) the amount initially recognised by the Bank  is overstated and lies \nsignific antly above my valuation range;  \n(2) the Kreston 2016 Dnipro Office Report’s Comparables Approach, which \nunderlies the Original  2016 Value of UAH 212.1m is just outside of my \nvaluation range, although only by 5%.

In 2014, Russian soldiers entered Cr imea and parts \nof eastern Ukraine, with Crimea subsequently being annexed from Ukraine. As \nshown in Figure 7-1 below, tourist arrivals into Ukraine approximately halved in \n2014 and decreased further in 2015, before starting to increase again in 2016. As \nat my valuation date in July 2016, tourist arrivals into Ukraine remained far below \nlevels seen prior to 2014.  \nFigure 7-1: Tourist inflow s into Ukraine  (millions)  \n  \nSource: Appendix 22 , tab ‘Charts for report’.  \n7.16 Tourism expenditure in Ukraine as a proporti on of GDP shows  a similar trend,  \ndeclining significantly in 2014 , and remaining below 2013 levels in 2014, 2015 and \n2016 , as shown in Figure 7-2 below . \n051015202530\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016millions\nD19/1/127\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 128 \n \n \n \n Figure 7-2: Tourism expenditure in Ukraine as a proportion of GDP  \n \nSource: Appendix 22 , tab ‘Charts for report’ . \n7.17 The number of visitors to the Bukovel ski resort also declined over this period. The \narea was visited by 1.2 million visitors during the 2010/2011 ski season,334 but this \nnumber declined to  half a million visitors during the 2015/2016 season.335  \n7.18 Two commonly used performance measures of a hotel are its average daily rate \n(“ADR ”) and its occupancy. The ADR is a measure of the average room rate paid \nfor rooms sold. Occupancy is the percentage of available rooms that were sold \nduring a period. It is calculated by dividing the number of rooms sold by the \nnumber of available rooms.  \n \n334  See Exhibit MB -B31: Bukovel Mountain Resort, Ecosign.  \n335  See Exhibit MB -B32: Bukovel Ski, Trans fer-Bukovel, page 3.  \n0%1%2%3%4%5%6%\n024681012\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\nTourism expendtiure (as % of GDP)Tourism expenditure (USDbn)\nTourism expenditure (USDbn) Tourism expendtiure (as % of GDP)\nD19/1/128\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 129 \n \n \n \n 7.19 The decline  in the number of tourists visiting Ukraine had a negative effect on \nUkrainian hotel revenues when express ed in USD.

International hotel companies operating \nin Ukraine tend to price their rooms in USD but some hotels price rooms in UAH \n(including Hotel  Zirka, as discussed later in this section). An August 2016 article by \nJones Lang Lasalle (“ JLL”)337 explains that:338 \n“For the past three years the dynamics of the average rate in local \ncurrency in Kiev hotels closely followed the exchange rate of hryvnia \nagainst the dollar. This means that quality hotels in the market are \nwithstanding the urge to lower prices in order to compete with local \nplayers for occupancy. International hoteliers are well aware of how \ndifficult it is to restore rates after price wars,  even in a strong market .” \n7.22 In the same article, JLL expected the occupancy of Kyiv hotels to rebound within \ntwo to three years, stating that:339 \n“There is every reason to believe that in case of continuation of current \ndynamics, [the]  Kiev market will fully rebound to the usual occupancy \nlevels within two to three years. … The main drivers will be the business \nactivity returning to the region and restoring the image of Kiev as a \ntourist destination among international travellers.

In particular, Hotel Zirka was affected by the \nevents of 2014 in Ukraine which will not have affected hotels in other \ncountries, and Hotel Zirka’s prospects will be closely tied to the prospects of \nthe Bukovel ski resort as a tourist destination, whereas the prospects of \nhotels in other countries will not.  \n7.28 I set out below my valuation of Hot el Zirka using the DCF approach. I then cross -\ncheck my resulting valuation using valuation multiples, which I calculate for \ncompanies comparable to Hotel Zirka but located  in other countries.  \n7.29 The only information I am aware of within the disclosure that i s relevant to my \nvaluation of Hotel Zirka is contained in the valuation reports provided to me. I \nhave not been able to verify the information in these reports except in limited \ncases, such as where that information is provided on the hotel’s website.  \n7.30 I have access to monthly historical financial data for Hotel Zirka for the 18 -month \nperiod from January 2015 to June 2016 but do not have information on the hotel’s \nperformance in other periods.  \nDCF analysis  \nRoom revenues  \n7.31 Hotel Zirka’s room revenues depend on three inputs: (i) the number of rooms; \n(ii) room occupancy rates; and (iii) room prices.  \nD19/1/133\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 134 \n \n \n \n 7.32 I understand that Hotel Zirka had 252 rooms at my valuation date (and that it \ncontinues to do so).345  \n7.33 I have limited information on Hotel Zirka’s historical occupancy rates and room \nprices. In particular, as explained above, I only have this information from January \n2015 to June 2016. During this period, the wider Ukrainian hotel market was still \nrecovering from events i n 2014. The visitors to the Bukovel ski resort where Hotel \nZirka is located consisted largely of domestic Ukrainian visitors rather than visitors \nfrom abroad, so Hotel Zirka may have been less negatively affected than hotels \nmore focused on international a rrivals.346 Nonetheless, due to events starting in \n2014 there may have been expectations around my valuation date that Hotel \nZirka’s occupancy rates and room rates would both rise in future.  \n7.34 I do not have historical information on the performance of Hotel Zirka prior to \nJanuary 2015 which would enable me to assess: (i) the effect of the events of \n2014 on Hotel Zirka specifically; or (ii) Hotel Zirka’s long -run performance which \nmight provide a benchmark for future performance. I do, however, have access to \nforecasts as at 2016 contained in the Veritas 2016 Zirka Report and the AE 2019 \nZirka Report, which valued the hotel as at 30  June 2016 and 31 December 2016 \nrespectively.  \n7.35 When performing my DCF calculation, I adopt the occupancy assumptions in the \nVeritas  2016 Zirka Report, as these appear more reasonable than those in the AE \n2019 Zirka Report. In particular, in the first full year of my forecast (2017), I \nassume occupancy of 42.4%, and I assume a 5% annual increase in occupancy \nthereafter until 2021. Thes e assumptions are shown in Table 7-4 below.  \nTable 7-4: My forecasts of occupancy rates  \n Jul 15 - \nJun 16  2017  2018  2019  2020 2021  \n  Historical  Forecast  Forecast  Forecast  Forecast  Forecast  \nOccupancy rate  39.8%  42.4%  44.5%  46.7%  49.1%  51.5%  \nSource: Appendix 22 , tab ‘FTI - revenue & cost’ . \n \n345  AE 2019 Zirka Report, page 19.

This report relies on actual hotel room rates in November and \nDecember 2017, which it uses to estimate room  rates for the first 10 months of \nthe year, based on trends in room prices during 2019, which vary due to the \nseasonality of Hotel Zirka .351 \n \n347  See Figure 7-3. \n348  See Figure 7-3. I have identified limited information on the occupancy rates of hotels \nlocated in oth er ski resorts. The average occupancy rate in the 2019/2020 ski season for \nski resorts in France was 71% (see Exhibit MB -B40: Statista, French ski resort occupancy \nrates 2019 -20 and 2020 -21). However, annual occupancy of a hotel in a ski resort is likely \nto be lower than its occupancy during the ski season, and many of the most visited ski \nresorts in Europe are located in France (see Exhibit MB -B41: Europe’s Best Destinations, \nBest Ski Resorts in Europe).  \n349  Data from the UTG Kyiv Hotel Market Overview 201 6 shows that typical occupancy rates \nin Kyiv hotels ranged from 45% to 52% between 2010 and 2013.  \n350  AE 2019 Zirka Report, page 57.  \n351  AE 2019 Report, page 55. This approach uses information that would not have been \navailable as at my valuation date or tha t of AE. Valuers normally do not use hindsight \nwhen valuing assets, as the value of an asset depends on expectations as at the valuation \ndate. However, in the absence of any information on the hotel’s historical room rates \nfrom before 2014, I rely on the f orecasts in the AE 2019 Zirka Report as an estimate of \nexpectations at my valuation date.  \nD19/1/135\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 136 \n \n \n \n 7.38 This approach implies a substantial  increase in room rates of about 44% in 2017, \nrelative to prices in the year to 30 June 2016. I have cross -checked this approach \nby reference to Hotel Zirka’s advertised room rates shown on its website between \nJuly 2016 and July 2017, which show a 48% incr ease in price.352 This large increase \nin rates may be explained by: (i)  Ukrainian inflation of 14.4% in 2017;353 and (ii) \nfurther recovery of room rates following the effects of 2014.354  \n7.39 I adopt this 44% increase in ADR rather than the smaller 11.8 % ADR incr ease \nassumed in respect of 2017 in the Veritas 2016 Zirka Report, which was based on \nforecast inflation only.355  \n7.40 In subsequent years, following the substantial increase in 2017 room rates, the AE \n2019 Zirka Report assumes that prices will increase in line with expected \nUkrainian inflation.

So as \nto account for the seasonality of the hotel’s performance, I estimate Hotel Zirka’s \nrevenues in H2 2016 by:  \n(1) assuming a linear increase in revenue between: (i) th e historical data in H2 \n2015; and (ii) the forecast data in H2 2017; and  \n(2) estimating the proportion of 2017 revenue earned in H2 by applying the \nsame revenue split between H1 and H2 as achieved in 2015.  \nCost forecasts  \n7.45 I estimate the hotel’s management  fee by applying the contractual fee \npercentages to my forecasts of the hotel’s room revenues and total revenues .  \n7.46 The hotel owner also pays the operating costs of the hotel. These costs vary \ndepending on the hotel’s occupancy. Figure 7-5 below shows the relationship \nbetween the hot el’s total monthly revenue including non -room revenue \n(horizontal axis) and its operating costs excluding the management fee (vertical \naxis) over the period for which I have this information.  \nFigure 7-5: Hot el Zirka’s monthly revenue and operating costs from January \n2015 to June 2016  \n  \nSource: Appendix 22 , tab ‘Charts for report’.  \n - 2 4 6 8 10 12 14\n -  10  20  30  40  50Operating costs (UAHm)\nRevenues (UAHm)\nD19/1/138\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 139 \n \n \n \n 7.47 I forecast the hotel’s operating  costs in two parts:  \n(1) I assume that in the year to 30 June 2016 the hotel incurred UAH 4m of \nmonthly fixed operating costs independent of the level of occupancy, being \nthe approximate minimum level of such costs shown in Figure 7-5. This \nequates to annual fixed costs of UAH 48m. I forecast these fixed operating \ncosts  assuming that they increase with Ukrainian inflation; and  \n(2) I assume that the hotel’s remaining operating costs in the year to 30  June \n2016 (UAH 37m) were variable costs.359 This equates  to 24% of total \nrevenue for the year.360 I therefore  forecast the hotel’s variable operating \ncosts at 24% of total revenue in all years.361  \n \n359  The total operating costs excluding the management fee in the year to 30 June 2016 were \nUAH  85m. I estimate the hotel’s variable operating costs for the period to be UAH 37m \n(=UAH 85m – UAH 48m).  \n360  The total revenue of the period was UAH 155m (see Table 7-6).  \n361  In doing so,  I implicitly assume that these costs will rise in 2017 in line with both \noccupancy increases and the 44% assumed rise in room rates.

I assume it paid no tax as the company reported a \nloss in every year from 2016 to 2020, exc ept 2019. Companies do not pay corporation tax \non losses, and are typically able to carry tax losses forward (including under Ukrainian tax \nlaw), such that I assume the losses in 2016 to 2018 mean that the company may not have \nbeen liable for corporation t ax in 2019.

Longer term, I \nwould expect the hotel to require further investment as its assets age. I explain \nmy ap proach to this in my discussion of the terminal value further below.   \n7.51 In the case of working capital, I assume, consistent  with the valuation reports I \nhave reviewed, that the hotel owner does not need to contribute working capital \nto operate the hotel.

Specifically, I use a WACC  as the \ndiscount rate.368 I estimate Hotel Zirka’s WACC to be 16% as at 1 July 2016.  This is \nbetween the discount rates used in the AE 2019 Zirka Report and the Veritas 2016 \nZirka R eport.369 I explain my calculation in more detail in Appendix 5 . \n \n368  The WACC is a weighted average of the cost of equity and debt financing and is commonly \nused for discounting cash flows in a DCF analysis. I explain this in more detail in Appendix \n5. \n369  Like me, AE used a UAH -denominated WACC. AE’s WACC was between 19.8% and 20.5% \ndepending on the year. As I explain in Appendix 5 , Veritas used a USD -denominated cost \nof equity of 14.7% (although applied to UAH cash flows). Relative to my own discount rate, \nI would expect Veritas’ use of a USD -denominated rate to decrease the rate applied, but \nthe use of a cost of equity to increase the rate appli ed. \nD19/1/142\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 143 \n \n \n \n Terminal value  \n7.54 I assume a terminal growth rate of 5%  per annum , in line with the inflation target \nintroduced by the NBU in 2016 .370  \n7.55 The EBITDA margins of up to 55% implied by my forecast s are higher than those \nachieved by any of the comparable companies  I identify for Hotel Zirka in  \nAppendix 19 .

I assume that the combined \ncontributions to the renovation fund and additional capital expenditure would \nhave needed to increase to 16% of revenue, being the median level of \ndepreciation relative to revenue  of the comparable companies. I prefer to rely on \nthe lower median statistic based on depreciation rather than capital expenditure \nbecause:  \n(1) capital expenditure may include investments to expand the scale of the \nbusiness rather than only investments to maintain existing assets (such as \nconstruction costs  to extend an existing hotel);  \n(2) in contrast, depreciation charges are more likely to be consistent with the \ncompany’s existing revenue base; and  \n(3) depreciation charges tend to be more stable over time than capital \nexpenditure which  is lumpier.  \n \n371  The only information I have on Hotel Zirka’s historical capital expenditure or depreciation \nis contained in the AE 2019 Zirka Report which provides a cost item covering “ Financial \ncosts, insurance, real estate tax, deprec iation of the hotel for staff ” for H1 2016 .

My adjustment to Hotel Zirka’s capital expenditure in the \nterminal period is also intended to achieve consistency of revenue and investment, \nhowever I implement it using a different approach as information on capital expen diture \nand depreciation is more readily available for comparable hotels than for petrol stations. \nIn the case of my hotel valuation: (i) I do not apply any adjustment prior to 2022 because I \nunderstand that the hotel was newly refurbished and my assumed gr owth in this period is \nmainly driven by the recovery of the tourism market, rather than by invested capital; and \n(ii) I calculate the adjustment in the terminal period based on the proportion of \ndepreciation to revenue at comparable hotels (see ¶ 7.57 ). \n373  UAH 142m = 43% x revenue in terminal period of UAH 398m x (1 - tax rate of 18%).  \n374  I note that my valuation is not sensitive to changes in the discount rate (see Appendix 5  \nfor further details on sensitivity analysis).  \nD19/1/145\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 146 \n \n \n \n 7.62 One common type of valuation  multiple is the ‘profit multiple’, being the ratio of \nobserved prices or calculations of enterprise value (“EV”) or equity value to \nvarious accounting measures of profitabilit y. For example , the ‘EV/EBITDA’ \nmultiple is the ratio of the EV of a company to its earnings before interest, taxes, \ndepreciation and amortisation  (“EBITDA ”). Another common type of valuation  \nmultiple is the ‘ revenue  multiple’, being the ratio of value to revenue, expressed \nas EV/ Revenue . A further valuation multiple used in the hotel sector is EV/Room, \nbeing the ratio of EV to the number rooms in the hotel.  \n7.63 In selecting an appropriate measure of profit or revenue to which to apply a \nvaluation multiple , it is  necessary to consider whether the measure is a \nmeaningful measure of the future prospects of the business. This is referred to as \n‘maintainable’ performance which may exclude the effects of one -off events and \ninclude anticipated changes in the business.  I normalise both Hotel Zirka’s \nrevenues and EBITDA in 2016 to remove the effects of geopolitical events in 2014, \nassuming that these effects were expected at the time to be temporary.  \n7.64 I calculate normalised revenue of UAH  269m assuming:  \n(1) 252 rooms;  \n(2) an occupancy rate of 51.5%, which is my forecast occupancy rate in the \nfinal year of the forecast period in my DCF calculation (and in my terminal \nperiod) (see Table 7-4);  \n(3) room rates based on my 2017 ADR forecast deflated for inflation between \n2016 and 2017;375 and \n(4) non-room revenues of 61.4 % of room revenues, comprising revenues from \nrestaurants (51.9%) and spas / conference rooms (9.5 %) (see paragraph \n7.42 ).  \n7.65 Using my estimate of normalised revenue, I estimate normalised EBITDA assuming \nan EBITDA margin of 55%, being  the EBITDA margin in the fina l year of the \nforecast period in my DCF.

In the \nabsence of sufficient information to value Hotel Mir ’s office space using a DCF, I \nperform my valuation  of the office part of Hotel Mir  using the value per m2 of \ncomparable properties located in the same part of Kyiv as Hotel Mir.  \nHotel Mir’s floor area  \n8.20 The office a nd hotel portions of Hotel Mir are located in two buildings , Building A \nand Building B . These have areas of 5,192m2 and 11,677m2 respectively.401 \n8.21 The valuation reports available to me make different assumptions about the split \nof usage of the space in these  buildings. In particular, they make different \nassumptions on whether:  \n(1) Building B is used solely as a hotel or also contains office space; and  \n(2) the available space could be more optimally used and, if so, how.  \n8.22 Table 8-4 shows the assumptions made in the available reports.  \n \n401  These areas are consistent across the valuation reports I have reviewed.

I consider t hese inputs in turn below.  \n8.32 First , I assume Hotel Mir had 138 rooms. This is based on the hotel’s website in \n2016411 and is consistent with the number of rooms assumed in the CBRE 2016 \nand 2017 Mir Reports.  \n8.33 Some of the valuation reports I have reviewed assu me a different number of \nrooms as shown in Table 8-7 below. In this table, I note that:  \n(1) the UCE 2015 Mir Report, the Colliers 2015 Mir Report and the EY Report \nreferred to 185 rooms. This is consistent with the number of rooms \nreported on th e hotel’s website in 2015.412 I understand that the number of \nrooms was reduced in 2016 because some rooms were repurposed to \nprovide additional office space. In this regard, CBRE stated that:413 \n“the premises above the 2nd floor [of Building B]  are former h otel rooms, \nwhich as of the valuation date have been reequipped to be leased as an \noffice space.”  \n“As noted in this Report, the building, letter A was previously used as a \nhotel, four floors of the building letter B (floors 4, 6, 8 and 11) and the \ngallery between the buildings have now been converted into offices and \nare for rent…According to the management company, the reformatting \nof rooms into offices took place due to negative trends in the hotel real \nestate market and more favourable conditions in the office market.”  \n \n409  See paragraphs 8.33 , 8.37  and 8.47 . \n410  See Table 8-7 and Table 8-8. \n411  Exhibit MB -B48: Hotel Mir archived website (14 June 2016) . \n412  Exhibit MB -B52: Hotel Mi r archived website (26 Feb ruary  2015) . \n413  CBRE 2017 Mir Report, page s 11 and  45. \nD19/1/159\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 160 \n \n \n \n (2)  Expert+ assumed that all of Hotel Mir’s office space would be converted \ninto double rooms, resulting in a much higher number of rooms;414 and \n(3) UTG did not explain the basis for its assumption "}

The reported ADRs for Hotel Mir were \nlower than these advertised prices. This may be because: (i) the advertised rates \ninclude VAT; (ii) Hotel  Mir offered discounts to its advertised  prices; and/or \n(iii) there were differences in the mix of room types advertised and sold.  \n8.36 Hotel Mir’s advertised and achieved prices both fell in 2014 , consistent with \ndeclines in the Ukrainian hotel market more generally at this time.

I do not have access to the actual or budgeted Hotel Mir ADR in H2 2016.  \n417  The CBRE 2017 Mir Report states a much higher ADR of UA H 500, which is in line with the \nADRs stated in the Colliers 2015 Mir Report (Source: CBRE 2017 Mir Report, page 47).   \nD19/1/161\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 162 \n \n \n \n (1) while the data from CBRE suggests that Hotel Mir’s ADR fell sharply from \n2014 to H1 2016, this trend differs from that of the wider Kyiv hotel market. \nFor instance, Kyiv  hotel ADRs for 3 - to 5-star hotels (in UAH) had recovered \nstrongly by 2016, having fallen in 2014;418  \n(2) the difference between Hotel Mir’s advertised room rate and the reported \nADR rose considerabl y in H1 2016, when I would expect this difference to \nhave declined as the market recovered further; and  \n(3) the monthly ADR figures presented in the CBRE 2016 Mir Report do not \nreconcile with the stated number of rooms, occupancy level and room \nrevenues in the same report. The stated room revenue, number of roo ms \nand occupancy level in H1 2016 imply an ADR of UAH 493.419 That level of \nADR indicates an average discount to the advertised price (47%) equal to \nthat implied by the 2014 ADR in the Colliers 2015 Mir Report.   \n8.38 For the purposes of my valuation, I assume a  (normalised) ADR of UAH 560 based \non the room rate advertised  on the hotel’s website during 2016 , discounted by \n40% to reflect the historical difference between advertised room rates and the \nADRs shown in  Table 8-8.  \n8.39 In making this assumption, I implicitly assume that no further recovery in Hotel \nMir’s ADR was expected beyond 2016. With the benefit of hindsight, Hotel Mir’s \nadvertised rates in 2017 were  UAH 1,071, a 15% increase  from the 2016 rates. \nThis is  consistent with Ukrainian inflation in 2016  which was 15%420 and consistent \nwith my assumption that Hotel Mir’s pricing was not expected to increase other \nthan through inflationary increases beyond 2016.  \n8.40 Third , I consider  Hotel Mir’s annual occupancy rate. As for ADRs, the Colliers 2015 \nMir Report and CBRE 2016 Mir Report both contain information on occupancy. \nTable 8-9 below summarises  the available information .  \n \n418  ADR s of 3 - to 5-star hotels in USD can be seen in the  UTG Kyiv Hotel Market Overview \n2016 ; when converted to UAH, this shows a strong  recovery in ADRs by 2016. I do not  \nhave th is statistic for 3 -star hotels only.   \n419  I calculate an implied ADR of UAH 493 by dividing the total ‘Income from Rooms’ in H1 \n2016 by the number of rooms sold (the number of rooms available multiplied by the \noccu pancy rates).

This is the occupancy  that would be achieved if the number of rooms sold \nwas similar to the number sold in 2012 and 2013.422 \n8.44 This occupancy level exceeds Hotel Mir’s occupancy in H1 2016 and is slightly \nhigher than the reference in the Expert+ 201 9 Mir Report  to an occupancy rate at \n1 October 2016 of “ at least 55% ”.423  \n \n421  The UCE 2015 Mir Report, which is dated 31 July 2015, assumes 185 rooms. The CBRE \n2016 Mir Report is dated 1 July 2016 and assumes 138 rooms. This suggests that the \nconversion happened between these two dates.  \n422  Based on the hotel having 185 rooms, the o ccupancy rates in 2012 and 2013 imply 81 and \n79 rooms were sold respectively (43.6% x 185; 42.8% x 185). In 2016, if 80 rooms were \nsold this would equate to occupancy of 80/138 = 58.0%.  \n423  Expert+ 2019 Mir Report, page 10.  \nD19/1/163\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 164 \n \n \n \n 8.45 Based on the above analysis, I calculate normalised room revenue for Hotel Mir of \nUAH 16.4 m, calculated as 365 days x 138 rooms x ADR of UAH 560 x occupancy of \n58%.  \nNormalised revenue: Non -room revenue  \n8.46 Hotel Mir’s website as at 1 July 2016 indicated that the hotel had sources of \nrevenue other than room revenues, stating:424 \n“There are also 5 conference halls, 2 restaurants and a coffee -shop in the \nhotel. You can also find some additional services in our hotel such as \nsecured parking, free safe deposit box, gym and other services.”   \n8.47 The available sources of information  indicate materially different levels of non -\nroom revenue for the hotel, as shown in Table 8-10 below.  \nTable 8-10: Non -room revenue for Hotel Mir (UAH million)  \n Colliers 2015 Mir Report   CBRE 2016 \nMir Report  \n 2012  2013  2014  2015  H1 2016  \nRoom revenue  18.9  15.5  8.0 n/a 6.8 \nNon -room revenue  1.2 1.0 1.1 n/a 0.1 \nNon -room revenue \nas % of room \nrevenue  6.1%  5.9%  12.1%  n/a 1.0%  \nNote: Non -room revenue from the Colliers 2015 Mir Report is calculated as the \nsum of ‘Income from rent of premises’, ‘Revenues from parking’, ‘Income from \nfood’ and ‘Other income’.

In my calculation, I assume that \nnon-room reven ue accounts for 6.0% of room revenue. This is the mid -point of \nthe percentages implied by the Colliers data for 2012 and 2013. I do not rely on : \n \n424  Exhibit MB -B48: Hotel Mir arc hived website (14 June 2016) . \n425  See paragraph  A21.28 . \nD19/1/164\nConfidential   \n24 November 2021  \nTransferred Assets Report of Mark Be zant in BL-2017 -000665  | 165 \n \n \n \n (1) the higher percentage implied by the Colliers data for 2014 as this is likely \nto have been affected by one -off events causing a decline in room revenue \nin this year ; or \n(2) the lower percentage of non -room revenue referred to by CBRE as this \nappears relatively low compared to the level I would typically expect.  \n8.49 I therefore assume that the normalised revenue of Hotel Mir is UAH 1 7.3m (room \nrevenue of UAH 1 6.4m x 1.06).  \nNormalised EBITDA  \n8.50 To assess the normalised EBITDA of the hotel portion of Hotel Mir, I have \nconsidered the following reference points:  \n(1) the 2012 EBITDA margin for the hotel portion of Hotel Mir, as stated in the \nColliers 2015 Mir Report, which is 21.9%;426 \n(2) the 2016 EBITDA data (H1 2016 actual and H2 2016 budget) contained in \nthe 2016 CBRE Report for the office and hotel space in aggregate, which I \nestimate implies an EBITDA margin for the hotel alone of about 24.1%;427 \nand \n(3) the median of the 2015 EBITDA margins of the companies I have identified \nwhich are comparable to Hotel Mir (discussed in Appendix 19 ), which is \n29.3%, with a range f rom 25.8% to 39.7%.  \n8.51 In the absence of further information, I assume a normalised EBITDA margin of \n24.1%. I apply th is margin to my normalised revenue of UAH 17.3 m to assess a \nnormalised EBITDA for the hotel portion of Hotel Mir of UAH 4.2m. \n \n426  See Table A21 -2. \n427  This report disaggregates the revenue of the office and hotel space but does not \ndisaggr egate the total costs. For the purposes of this calculation, I assume the costs \nassociated with the office space amount to 6% of office revenues. My assumption is based \non the costs assumptions made in the Colliers 2015 Mir Report, which are: (i) operating  \ncosts amounting to 5% of revenue; and (ii) replacement costs amounting to 1% of net \noperating income (Source: Colliers 2015 Mir Report, pages 61 and 62). The total of these \ncosts is approximately 6% of revenue since Colliers calculates office net operatin g income \nas 95% of office revenue.

Applying the multiples to my normalised r evenue of UAH 17.3m \nand EBITDA of UAH 4.2m  results in a market value of the hotel ranging from \nUAH  23.3m  to UAH  145.4m .  \n \n428  The CRP s for the relevant countries in 2016 we re: Ukraine  (7.6%), Croatia (2.9%); Pol and \n(1.7%); and Romania (2.1%) (Source: Exhibit MB -A31: Duff & Phelps 2016 International \nValuation Handbook).
