I do not read or speak these \nlanguages.  I have therefore relied upon ma chine translations and translations provided \nto me by Fieldfisher and Secretariat staff (who read and speak Russian, Ukrainian and \nPolish).   \n Information deficiencies \n1.3.4  As I explained in my First Report,2 there are significant deficiencies in the information \navailable for the underlying compa nies whose shares were pledged.  \n1.3.5  Given the significant information deficiencies , my valuations are necessarily subject to \nuncertainty.  My valuation conclusions may require updating should more information \nbecome available. \n Terms of reference \n1.3.6  The terms of reference present ed in paragraphs 1.5.9 and 1.5.10 of my First Report are \nalso explicitly applicable to this report. \n Calculations \n1.3.7  Figures included in this report have been ro unded and, as such, some of the tables and \nfigures may not calculate exac tly due to rounding differences. \n1.3.8  To assist the Court, throughout this rep ort I have adopted the same foreign exchange \nsource as Mr Bezant, being S&P Capita l IQ, when converting various currencies. \n1.4 Structure of report \n1.4.1  The remainder of this report is structured as follows: \n(a) Section 2 - Executive summary; \n(b) Section 3 – Valuation approach; \n(c) Section 4 – Principal differences betwe en Mr Bezant’s and my valuations; and \n(d) Section 5 – Expert’s declaration. \n \n2  My First Report, paragraphs 1.5.5 to 1.5.8. \nD9/109/7\n  BL-2017-000665 \n  Second Expert Report of Tr avis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  21 February 2022 \n \nConfidential   5  \n \n2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n2.1 Summary of valuations \n2.1.1  In Table 2-1 to Table 2-4, below, I summa rise my valuations for the Share Pledges I \nvalue in this report at t he following valuation dates: \n(a) 31 December 2013; \n(b) 31 December 2014; \n(c) 31 December 2015; and \n(d) 31 October 2016. \n2.1.2  I have applied an illu strative minority discount to my valuations of 0% and 30%.

These concepts and \nmethodologies underpin my valuatio ns of the Share Pledges.   \n3.1.2  In this section, I summarise the valuation approaches applied in this report and my \nconcluded valuations.  I then present my valu ation of the Share Pledges I value in this \nreport, after the application of illustrative minority discounts. \n3.2 Summary of valuation approaches applied  \n Valuation approaches applied \n3.2.1  When valuing the shareholdings underlying the Share Pledges, I considered all the \nvaluation methodologies set out in section 3.4 of my First Report.  In Table 3-1, below, \nI set out the valuation approaches that I a pplied before concluding on a value for each \nof the 15 companies valued in this report. \nTable 3-1  Valuation methodologies applied in my valuation conclusions4 \n \n My concluded valuations \n3.2.2  As discussed in section 1.3, I consider there to  be significant deficiencies in the \ninformation available for many of the companies  I have been instructed to value.

In some cases,  where we applied different approaches or \nused different sources of fi nancial information, it had li ttle effect on the valuation \nconclusions. \n4.3.2  In this section, I identify the princip al differences between our valuations. \n Antarktika \n4.3.3  Mr Bezant and I consider a number of the sa me valuation approaches in our valuations \nof Antarktika; however, Mr Bezant’s conclude d value for Antarktika is based upon a P/BV \nusing Antarktika’s unconsolidated financial statements.12  In my opinion, this approach \nis inappropriate, along with Mr Bezant’s application of an additional discount for \noperating in Ukraine.13  The upper end of my range is based on a multiples-based \nvaluation approach of Antarktika’s principal su bsidiary, IMRP, which is not consolidated \nin the financial statements di sclosed for Antarktika.   \n Penny Lane \n4.3.4  Mr Bezant concludes on a value for Pen ny Lane based on his EV/EBITDA multiple \napproach, whereas I also rely upon EV/EBIT and EV/Revenue multiples, as well as \ncontemporaneous valuations performed by third parties.14  The high-end of my valuation \nrange exceeds Mr Bezant’ s valuation at 31 December 2013 and 2014 because my \nmaintainable financial metrics and my multiples are higher. \n \n12  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, Table A14-22. \n13  I discuss Mr Bezant’s applicat ion of a Ukrainian discount in section 4.5 of my First Report. \n14  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, Table A17-15. \nD9/109/18\n  BL-2017-00066"}

My \nvaluation of Teide exceeds Mr Bezant becaus e I have (a) normalised the financial metrics \nfor Teide to reflect an assumption that T eide was expected to generate revenues above \nthe minimum lease payment in the future, and (b) adopted higher multiples than \nMr Bezant. \n Kievguma \n4.3.6  Mr Bezant concludes that Kievguma had nil value given it was loss-making, had \nnegative net assets and low revenues.15  However, transactions in Kievguma’s shares \nand my revenue-multiple valuation indicate that  Kievguma’s equity value was positive.  \nFurthermore, Mr Bezant’s valuation does not  assign any value to Arena Kiev.  My \nvaluation ranges for Kievguma reflect the va lue of Kievguma’s c onstruction project, \nArena Kiev, as a surplus asset.  My assessment  of Arena Kiev is subject to a number of \nlimitations, including uncertaint y around (a) Kievguma’s ownership interest, (b) the costs \nincurred and (c) the fina ncing of the project. \n KFC \n4.3.7  Mr Bezant and I have both valued KFC with reference to comparable company multiples.  \nMy multiples were higher than those identified by Mr Bezant.  Further, Mr Bezant applied \na 25% discount to his multiples “ to reflect KFC’s location in a higher-risk jurisdiction than \nthe comparable companies ”.16  I do not think it is necessary to apply such a discount \ngiven, inter alia , KFC sells its products internationally.  As a result of the differences in \nmultiples, I concluded on a valuation range fo r KFC whereas Mr Bezant concluded it had \nnil value. \n4.3.8  Mr Bezant assessed KFC’s value at 31 December 2013, 2014 and 2015 given he did not \nknow when one of KFC’ s Share Pledges was termi nated (DZK-1149 agreed on \n10 April 2013, referred to as DZK-1149-b).17  I identified a schedule stating Share \nPledge DZK-1149 was terminated in 2014 and so I only value KFC at 31 December \n2013.18 \n \n15  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pl edges Report, paragraph A18.41. \n16  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pl edges Report, paragraph A21.33. \n17  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, paragraph A21.5. \n18  Paragraphs A8.2.4 and A8.2.5. \nD9/109/19\n  BL-2017-000665 \n  Second Expert Report of Tr avis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  21 February 2022 \n \nConfidential   17  \n \n Dinacom \n4.3.9  Mr Bezant and I adopt the same valuation approaches to value Dinacom as at \n31 December 2013, 2014 and 2015 and concluded on very similar values for each \napproach.19  At the first two valuation dates, Mr Bezant and I both conclude that \nDinacom had nil value.  At 31 December 2015, Mr Bezant based his overall conclusion \non Dinacom’s net asset value, which falls wi thin the range implied by the application of \nEV/EBIT and EV/EBITDA multipl es that represent the low and high ends of my valuation \nrange.20 \n Mawex \n4.3.10  Mr Bezant concluded that Mawex had nil valu e on the basis that it was loss-making and \nhad negative net assets.21  He also concluded that Mawex’s interest in Skorzonera had \nnil value.22  I conclude that Mawex’s interest in Skorzonera results in a positive equity \nvalue at my valuation dates, based on my EV/EBITDA multiple based valuation and \nthird-party valuation reports for Skorzonera.  I therefore adjust Mawex’s net asset value \nto reflect the market value of its equity interest in Skorzonera. \n Dnipronaftoprodukt \n4.3.11  Th"}

I therefore adjust Mawex’s net asset value \nto reflect the market value of its equity interest in Skorzonera. \n Dnipronaftoprodukt \n4.3.11  The ranges of values I conclude for Dnip ronaftoprodukt are based on (a) historical \ntransactions in its shares, (b) revenue-base d multiples and (c) its net asset value \nadjusted for the market value of the petrol stations it ow ns.  Mr Bezant dismissed the \nhistorical transactions as unrel iable and the use of multiples  as inappropriate due to the \ncompany’s historical la ck of profitability.23  I recognise that my valuation conclusion \ninvolves a wide range of values given the different valuation method ologies I applied.  \nWith additional relevant information this range could be narrowed. \n \n19  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, Table A24-15. \n20  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, Table A24-15. \n21  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pledges Report, paragraph A23.20 to A23.22. \n22  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pl edges Report, paragraph A23.21. \n23  Mr Bezant’s First Share Pl edges Report, paragraph A27.34. \nD9/109/20\n  BL-2017-000665 \n  Second Expert Report of Tr avis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  21 February 2022 \n \nConfidential   18  \n \n Gilton, Vikna-Plast and Autorembitservis  \n4.3.12  Mr Bezant values each of the companies whose primary business activity is owning and \noperating petrol stations (namely, Gilton, Vi kna-Plast and Autorembitservis) at nil value \nbased on the fact they have negative net a ssets and are historically loss-making.  I \nconsider Mr Bezant’s valuation of  the companies to be inconsistent with his valuation of \nthe underlying assets.  Some of the petrol  stations owned by these three companies \nwere transferred to the Bank in 2016 and therefore have been valued by Mr Bezant in \nhis report valuing the transferred assets (“ Mr Bezant’s First Transferred Assets \nReport ”) and Mr Brent Kaczmarek in his  second report for this matter (“ Mr Kaczmarek’s \nSecond Report ”) (together, the “ Transferred Assets Reports ”).  My valuations exceed \nMr Bezant’s valuations because I have adjust ed the companies’ net asset values by \nreference to Mr Bezant’s and Mr Kaczmarek’s va luations of the petrol  stations that were \ntransferred to the Bank in 2016.  \nD9/109/21\n  BL-2017-000665 \n  Second Expert Report of Tr avis Taylor on Share Pledges \n  21 February 2022 \n \nConfidential   19  \n \n5 EXPERT’S DECLARATION \nI, Travis Taylor, declare that: \n5.1.1  I understand that my duty in providing wri tten reports and giving evidence is to help the \nCourt, and that this duty overrides any ob ligation to the party by whom I am engaged or \nthe person who has paid or is liable to pay me.
