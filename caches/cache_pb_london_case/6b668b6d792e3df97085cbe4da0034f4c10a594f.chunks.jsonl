Kaczmarek  CFA , am a Partner in the Arlington, VA office of IAV  Advisors LLC \n(“IAV”) .  I am the 100 percent owner of IAV which I formed in August 2018.  Previous to my \nfounding of IAV, I worked for  Navigant Consulting Inc. (“Navigant”), a global, listed, \nconsultancy firm.  Navigant no longer exists.  Navigant sold its Disputes, Forensics, and Legal \nTechnology Segment and Transaction Advisory Services Practice  to Ankura Consulting LLC \n(“Ankura”).  Na vigant sold its remaining professional services practices nearly a year later to \nprivate -equity firm Veritas Capital.   I was formerly with the Disputes practice at Navigant for \n17 years, from 2001 until the sale of that practice to Ankura in August 2018, a nd I led \nNavigant’s International Arbitration practice.  I decided in August 2018 to form my own boutique firm rather than join Ankura.  Previous to joining Navigant, I worked at Arthur \nAndersen LLP and LECG Inc. between 1993 and 2001.    \n3. I hold the designation of Chartered Financial Analyst, a globally recognized designation held by professionals demonstrating competence in the investment valuation and decision- making \nprocess. I received this designation in 1998 from the Association for Investment Manageme nt \nand Research (now CFA Institute), the governing body of charter -holders. There are charter -\nholders and charter -holder candidates residing in more than 150 countries worldwide.  \n4. I have been appointed as a n economic, financial, asset valuation, and damages  expert in more \n160 disputes, including more than 150 international arbitrations .  Most of the international \narbitrations in which I am appointed are disputes between investors and sovereign states under \nD21/1/7\nPage 2 \n various bi -lateral or muti -lateral investment treati es. The commercial arbitrations in which I \nhave been appointed have typically related to shareholder agreement disputes, production \nsharing agreements and other matters that have also involved valuation issues.  I have also \nbeen appointed as an expert in l itigation matters in the USA, UK, Sweden, and the Turks & \nCaicos.  \n5. My valuation work and expertise includes all forms of assets including, inter alia , overall \nbusiness enterprises, common shares of business, corporate debt, sovereign debt, derivatives (such  as put and call options), real estate, and real property.  I have performed valuation \nanalysis of such assets in the USA, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, \nDominican Republic, Jamaica, Turks & Caicos, Chile, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, Venez uela, \nArgentina, and Uruguay, Spain, Germany, Sweden, Cyprus, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, \nCzech Republic, Slovak Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Croatia, Albania, Montenegro, \nUkraine, Turkey, UAE, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Yemen, Algeria, Angola, Egypt, South \nAfrica, Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Georgia, Pakistan, India, \nThailand, Vietnam, South Korea, Philippines, and New Zealand.  \n6. With respect to matters in Ukraine specifically, I have previously been appointed as an expert \nto value natural gas fields, hotels, office buildings, apartment buildings, airports, petrol \nstations, oil storage facilities, and residential property.  The hotels, office buildings, apartment \nbuildings, airports, petrol stations, and oil storage faciliti es were all located in Crimea as were \nthe subject assets in three international arbitrations against the Russian Federation.  These \nassets were all expropriated in 2014 following the Russian Federation’s annexation of the \npeninsula.

The First Defendant was  an indirect beneficiary in these three international \narbitrations and a direct client in one matter.  My other expert work in Ukraine involves \nappointments by Naftogaz, Ukraine’s state -owned oil and gas company, in several \ninternational disputes involving natural gas trading matters.  Those matters included disputes \nbetween Ukraine and the Russian Federation or gas prices and gas transit fees that resulted in \ngas supplies being cut off to Eastern Europe.  \n7. I also have served as an expert in many international arbitrations or litigations involving bank failures and restructurings.  Specifically, I have served as a financial expert on such cases in \nD21/1/8\nPage 3 \n the Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Sweden, Peru, Argentina, and South \nKorea.     \n8. My curriculum  vitae wa s provided as Appendix A to my First Report .   \nB. My Understanding of the Present Dispute Concerning the Transferred Assets  \n9. The following represents my overall understanding of the present dispute pertaining to the Transferred Assets.  This summary s hould not be construed to represent the full or particular \nposition of either Claimant or Defendants.  \n10. Between 2013 and 2015, PricewaterhouseCoopers Ukraine (“P wC”) was the auditor of JSC \nCommercial Bank PrivatBank (“PrivatBank” or “Claimant” or “Bank”).  I n January 2016, the \nNational Bank of Ukraine (“NBU”) conducted a stress test of PrivatBank which concluded that \nthe bank needed to raise its regulatory capital by UAH 113 billion.   \n11. In February 2016, the Management and Supervisory Board of PrivatBank approved a Financial Recovery Plan that included a Restructuring Program.  Under the Restructuring Program, \nPrivatBank was to take possession of 169 properties/assets with an alleged value of UAH 31 \nbillion and be granted mortgages over other properties/assets with an alleged value of UAH 77 \nbillion.  The NBU approved the Restructuring Program and undertook to confirm the Fair \nValue of the assets transferred to the Bank.  \n12.  The assets transferred to PrivatBank (the “Transferred Assets”) included: 246 petrol statio ns \n(“Petrol Stations”) , 72 oil storage facilities  (“OSFs”),  9 aircraft and 7 real estate properties.  \n13. Confirmation of the Fair Value of the Transferred Assets appears to have been performed under a tripartite agreement between independent valuers, PrivatBank, and the NBU. \n“The NBU validated the value of part of the repossessed property. \nValidation was performed through the receipt of reports of \nindependent valuers under tripartite agreements (between the valuer, \nthe Bank and the NBU). A total of 254 properties with a value at the \ntime the Bank took possession of them 31.9 billion UAH were \nvalidated. The value according to the results of the validation was \nUAH 31.5 billion.”\n1 \n \n1 PB0092834_00001_English (“EY Report”), p. 13.  \nD21/1/9\nPage 4 \n 14. Only a portion of the transferred assets appears to have been validated.  T he results of the \nvalidation are shown in Figure 1 below.   \nFigure 1 – Summary of NBU Fair Value Validation2 \n \n  \n15. Although the NBU had validated many of the Fair Value calculations adopted by PrivatBank \nin 2016, the calculations would ultimately be revisited and restated retrospectively in 2018 and \nsignificantly lowered.  I will discuss the aspects of this restatement in Section VII.   Claimant \nhas retained financial experts in this dispute who have largely validated the retrospective \nrestatement.  I will address the overall manner in which Claimant’s experts have carried out \ntheir analysis in section VII.  \nC. My Instructions  \n16. Solicitors for the First"}

I will address the overall manner in which Claimant’s experts have carried out \ntheir analysis in section VII.  \nC. My Instructions  \n16. Solicitors for the First Defendant, Fieldfisher h ave instructed me to address the value of the \nTransferred Assets with the exception of the Aircraft Assets.  Mr. Phil ip Seymour  of IBA Aero \nwas instructed to address the value of the Aircraft Assets.  \n \n2 EY Report, p. 40.  \nD21/1/10\nPage 5 \n 17. More specifically, I have been instructed by Fieldfisher to assess whether the values of the \nTransferred Assets as reported by PrivatBank in its 2016 financial statements were in \naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), the accounting \nstandards under which PrivatBank prepared its financial statements.  IFRS 13 provides the \nrules and guidelines under which Fair Value should be measured.  As such, I use IFRS 13 as \nmy guide to assess the Fair Values of the Transferred Assets in 2016.   \n18. While Mr. Bezant has been instructed to adopt a valuation date of 1 July 2016 (the average \ndate upon which the Fixed Assets were Transferred to the accounting ledgers of PrivatBank), \nI have adopted a valuation date of 31 December 2016.3  I don’t believe the difference in our \nchosen dates has any effect.  It appears that the Fair Values at initial recogn ition of all \nTransferred Assets remained the same at year end 2016 with the exception of the Dnipro Office \nand Hotel Zirka.  These two assets were adjusted downward in value very shortly after their \ninitial recognition.  The adjusted values for these two a ssets correspond to the pleaded values \nfor these assets by the First Defendant, as do all the other values for the Transferred Assets.        \n19. Where PrivatBank did not report the Transferred Assets in accordance with IFRS 13, I will \nexplain to the Court why that is so and provide my own independent Fair Value calculation \nthat would conform to IFRS 13.  \n20. PrivatBank also reported the Fair Value of the Transferred Assets in its financial statements from 2017 to 2018.  However, the Fair Value of the Transferred As sets were reduced \nsignificantly in 2017 and then further in 2018.  Moreover, in the 2018 financial statements, PrivatBank restated downward the Fair Values of the Transferred Assets as originally set forth \nin the 31 December 2016 financial statements based  upon valuations the bank commissioned \nfrom outside valuation firms.\n4  I am instructed to consider historic valuation and will opine \nupon the work done to support the restated Fair Values the Bank recognized in the 31 \nDecember 2016 financial statements.  I also am instructed to opine, to the extent possible, as \nto whether the Fair Values Reported in 2017 and 2018 conform to IFRS 13. \n \n3 Expert Report of Mark Bezant on Transferred Assets, 24 November 2021 (“Bezant Transferred Assets Report”), ¶ \n1.26.  \n4 PrivatBank 2018 Financial Statements, p. 11.

Mr. Bezant addresses the value of all Transferred Assets except the \nDnipro Stadium, Dnipro Training Centre, and the Airfield at Slobzhansky Settlement, Ukraine \nwhich are addressed by Mr. Thomas.

My Real Estate Report dated 24 January 2022 contains four sections that should be read in \nconnection with this report.

In Section V, I presented my review of the EY Report and \nthe EY audits of PrivatBank in relation to the Transferr ed Assets. In Section VI, I discussed \nmy view as to the reasons for the need to restate the Original 2016 Fair Value calculations.   \nThese sections are  just as relevant to my valuation of the Petrol Stations and OSFs as they are \nto my valuation of the Real Estate assets.  \nF. Organization of th e Remainder of this  Report  \n25. The remainder of this report contains nine  additional  sections.  In Section II , I provide an \nexecutive summary of my opinion concerning both the original Fair Values recognized in the \n31 December 2016 financial statements of PrivatBank (“Original 2016 Fair Values”) and the \nD21/1/12\nPage 7 \n restated Fair Values (“Restated 2016 Fair Values”).  I also provide my own opinion of Fair \nValue for the Petrol Stations and OSFs .   In Section III, I discuss the notional nature of the \npost-2016 Fair Value calculations for the Petrol Stations.  In Section I V, I discuss my \nobservations regarding PrivatBank’s lack of management of the Petrol Stations and OSFs .  In \nSection  V, I provide my commentary on Mr. Bezant’s valuation of the Petrol Stations under \nthe Income  Approach.  In Section VI , I discuss fundamental flaws in Mr. Bezant’s valuation \nof the OSFs.  In Section VII, I set out my calculation of the Fair Value of the Petrol Stations  \nas of 31 Decem ber 2016.   In Section V III, I summarize my calculation of the Fair Value of the \nOSFs.  In Section IX, I provide my expert declaration.  Finally, in Section X, I provide my  \nstatement of truth . \n Executive Summary \n26. As discussed in my First Expert Report dated 24 January 2022 regarding Real Estate assets \ntransferred to PrivatBank in 2016, the appropriate standard of value applicable to the 246 Petrol \nStations and 72 OSFs  is Fair Value rather than Market Value, the standard of value  allegedly \nimplemented by Mr. Be zant.  Likewise, the appropriate guidelines to be followed in \nimplementing Fair Value is IFRS 13, not International Valuation Standards (“ IVS”) as \nreferenced by Mr. Bezant.  My evaluation of Mr. Bezant’s valuation of the Petrol Stations using the Income Approach reveals at least  three conceptual errors , one of which violates the \nrequirements of IFRS 13  pertaining to Fair Value and the IVS guidelines pertaining to Market \nValue.

My evaluation of Mr. Bezant’s valuation of the Petrol Stations using the Income Approach reveals at least  three conceptual errors , one of which violates the \nrequirements of IFRS 13  pertaining to Fair Value and the IVS guidelines pertaining to Market \nValue.  With respect to  Mr. Bezant’s valuation of the OSFs, it is my view that his valuation \nanalysis clearly violates both the Fair Value and Market Value guidelines.  I discuss my \ncomments on Mr. Bezant’s valuation the Petrol Stations and OSFs in the following two \nsubsections. \nA. My Comments on Mr. Bezant’s Valuation and the 2016 Restated Fair Values  of \nthe 246 Petrol Stations  \n27. My review of Mr. Bezant’s DCF Model revealed at least three conceptual flaws.  \n28. First, Mr. Bezant disregards the historical sales volumes, revenues, and costs  that were \nprovided to the valuation firms engaged to value the 246 Petrol Stations transferred to the Bank (i.e., UCE, Ver itas, and Baker Tilly).  Instead, Mr. Bezant rejects this data on the basis of \n“cross checks ” he performed.  Mr. Bezant concludes the  sales volume data provided to the \nD21/1/13\nPage 8 \n valuation firms in 2016 is greatly overstated.  It is unclear if Mr. Bezant is of the view that this \ndata was intentionally manipulated by the enterprise owners or if he is of the view that there \nwas some systemic problem with the reports prepared for the valuation firms.  I have been \nprovided with the underlying sales volume and revenue data by petrol station by month \nbetween January 2015 and June 2016 and have  verified that this data is consistent with the data \nutilized by UCE and Veritas in the 2016 valuation analysis of the Petrol Stations.  I am of the \nview that there is no information or data that justifies the wholesale rejection of this data as \nMr. Bezant has done.  \n29. I have not performed “cross checks” of the sales vo lume data like Mr. Bezant other than an \nanalysis to demonstrate that the sales volume data is operationally reasonable for a typical \npetrol station.   Instead , I have gathered a substantial number of transactions involving petrol \nstations and petrol statio n networks which reveals that Mr. Bezant’s valuation conclusion of \napproximately US$ 300,000 per Petrol Station is unreasonably low.  Moreover, the sales \nvolume data relied upon by Mr. Bezant was generated by LLC Volyn Expert (“Volyn”)  using \nfield studies of comparable petrol stations in 2018.  Not only was this information not known \nor knowable as of 31 December 2016, a basic requirement when conducting a proper Market \nor Fair Value analysis, but it is unclear how Volyn used these field studies to determine sales \nvolumes at the 246 Petrol Stations.  Mr. Bezant appears to also be unaware of how the field \nstudies were conducted and how those field studies were utilized by Volyn to determine sales volumes at the 246 Petrol Stations.  In my view, the Volyn sales volumes are both unreliable \nand unusable in a Market or Fair Value analysis  given the data was not known or knowable on \nthe valuation date and one cannot ascertain  how 2018 field studies of comparable petrol \nstations were utiliz ed to estimate sales volumes at the 246 Petrol Stations.  \n30. Second, Mr. Bezant incorporates a concept he describes as Return on Net Invested Capital \n(“RONIC”) whereby he adds capital expenditures to limit the profitability of each Petrol \nStation.  Mr. Bezant attempts to reason that these additional capital expenditures are necessary \nbecause a firm cannot generate profits in excess of the cost of capital for an extended period \nof time.  I believe Mr. Bezant’s incorporation of his RONIC concept is flawed and mis placed.  \nThe incorporation of additional capital expenditures is flawed because Mr. Bezant assumes \nthese capital"}

I believe Mr. Bezant’s incorporation of his RONIC concept is flawed and mis placed.  \nThe incorporation of additional capital expenditures is flawed because Mr. Bezant assumes \nthese capital expenditures do not generate any incremental benefit for the Petrol Stations.  This \nis economically illogical.  Clearly a petrol station will n ot make capital investments into its \nD21/1/14\nPage 9 \n fixed assets if those investments are not expected to provide any economic benefit.  The \nincorporation of additional capital expenditures is also misplaced because Mr. Bezant does not \nconsider the competitive advantage a petrol station derive s from its physical location.  In my \nview, a company or petrol station which derives a benefit or competitive advantage from its \nphysical location can earn profits in excess of the cost of capital for an extended period of time \nbecau se competitors are unlikely to build a competing firm or petrol station in the same area \nunless the existing petrol station cannot handle  the total volume of potential customers in that \narea.  Accordingly, Mr. Bezant should have only incorporated maintenance capital \nexpenditures for each Petrol Station which, in my experience, equate to approximately 0.8 \npercent of sales per year.  \n31. Third, Mr. Bezant incorporates a country risk premium of 7.9 percent based upon the yield \nspread between US treasury bonds and Ukrainian government bonds issued in US dollars.  \nHowever, there are numerous valuation sources that describe the use of this spread (particular ly \nthe full spread) as an invalid measure of country risk.  Accordingly, I am of the view that Mr. \nBezant’s discount rate is overstated.  Moreover, I believe Mr. Bezant should have prepared his \nDCF Model in US dollars given that oil and oil product derivatives are international \ncommodities that are priced in US dollars.  \n32. Overall, Mr. Bezant’s DCF Model is not bas ed upon any financial information or data specific \nto the Petrol Station s.  Likewise, all Fair Value calculations performed by the Bank after the \nOriginal 2016 Fair Value calculations do not rely upon any financial information or data \nspecific to the Petro l Stations .  This is not only unusual but perplexing.  As the Bank took \nownership of the Petrol Stations in 2016, one would logically expect the Bank to have the \nfinancial results of the Petrol Stations for at least years 2016 to 2018.  However, the Bank does \nnot appear to have provided any valuation firm retained after 2016 with actual financial results.  \nInstead, all of the valuation firms utilized notional data.  It would appear to me that the Bank \nhas neglected to manage the Petrol Stations after th e Bank took ownership of them.  \n33. Mr. Bezant’s DCF Model generates an average value per Petrol Station of just US$ 300,000.  \nAs my Market Approach demonstrates, this average value is a significant outlier compared to \nthe prices at which hundreds of petrol stations have been sold in Eastern Europe, and Ukraine \nin particular, before 31 December 2016.  My valuation analysis reveals that Mr. Bezant’s value \nD21/1/15\nPage 10 \n conclusion for the 246 Petrol Stations is approximately 75 percent below a reasonable and \nreliable Fair Value conclusion for the Petrol Stations.   As Mr. Bezant’s Income Approach \nviolates the requirements for both Market and Fair Value standards, and yields a result that is \na substantial outlier, it is my view the Mr. Bezant’s valuation of the 246 Petrol Stations ca nnot \nbe relied upon.   \nB.

As Mr. Bezant’s Income Approach \nviolates the requirements for both Market and Fair Value standards, and yields a result that is \na substantial outlier, it is my view the Mr. Bezant’s valuation of the 246 Petrol Stations ca nnot \nbe relied upon.   \nB. My Comments on Mr. Bezant’s Valuation and the 2016 Restated Fair Values of \nthe 72 OSFs  \n34. The Original 2016 Fair Value assigned to the OSFs was UAH 5.685 billion.  In 2019, the 2016 Fair Value was restated downward by nearly 95 percent to UAH 312 million.  Mr. Bezant \nvalues the OSFs in 2016 at 521 million.  I have identified two substantial flaws in Mr. Bezant’s valuation of the OSFs.  \n35. First, Mr. Bezant relies upon the auction values of 42 OSFs that PrivatBank sold between July \n2019 and October 2021 as a basis to value all 72 OSFs.  Obviously, the sales prices of the \nOSFs sold during this period of time could not have been known or knowable as of July 2016 \n(Mr. Bezant’s valuation date) or 31 December 2016 (my valuation date).  As s uch, Mr. \nBezant’s valuation analysis does not conform to the cardinal valuation rule for determining \nMarket or Fair Value which is that the valuation analysis should only rely upon information \nthat was known or knowable at the valuation date .  \n36. Second, the 42 OSFs sold by the bank during this period of time were apparently not operational.  Mr. Bezant’s valuation analysis as of 2016 assumes the OSFs were in a similar \nnon-operational state.  While this is a factual matter that neither Mr. Bezant nor I can res olve, \nI believe assuming the OSFs were not operational in 2016 is quite implausible.  Given that 80 \nto 85 percent of all fuel is imported into Ukraine, petrol stations require intermediate storage \nfacilities to ensure an uninterrupted supply of fuel.  Mr. Bezant’s assumption that the OSFs \nwere not operational in 2016 would indicate that the 246 Petrol Stations were paying third parties for storage of fuel rather than using the OSFs owned by the Bank.  This is economically \nillogical.   Moreover, as I have indicated in subsection A above, it does not appear that the Bank \nmanaged either Petrol Stations or the OSFs after their transfer to the Bank in 2016.  If the Bank \nwas managing these assets, financial and operational data would be available between 2016 \nD21/1/16\nPage 11 \n and 2018.  However, none of this data has been provided to Mr. Bezant or the valuation firms \nretained by the Bank after 2016. \n37. Accordingly, Mr. Bezant has not put forward a valuation of the OSFs that complies with either \nthe Market or Fair Value standards.  As s uch, I am of the opinion that his valuation of the OSFs \nought to be disregarded.  \nC. Summary of My Valuation of the 246 Petrol Stations  \n38. I have determined the Fair Value of the 246 Petrol Stations using two valuation techniques: 1) the Income Approach, and 2) t he Market Approach.   \n39. With respect to the Income Approach, I have relied upon the same sales volumes and revenues \nprovided to UCE and Veritas in 2016.  As previously explained, I do not find any reasonable \nbasis to conclude that all of the sales reports ma de available to me, which include detailed sales \nvolumes and revenues by fuel type and month between January 2015 and June 2016 are overstated or unreliable.   I have confirmed that these reports match the data submitted to UCE \nand Ver itas in 2016.  I have also constructed m y DCF Model in US dollars  because oil and oil \nproduct derivations such a s petrol are international commodities priced in US dollars.  I \nconclude the Fair Value of the 246 Petrol Stations  is US$ 313,674,625  as of 31 December 2016 \nor US$ 1,275,100 per station.   The Fair Value originally assigned to the Petrol Stations as of \n31 December 2016 averaged  approximately US$ 1 million.  \n40.

I \nconclude the Fair Value of the 246 Petrol Stations  is US$ 313,674,625  as of 31 December 2016 \nor US$ 1,275,100 per station.   The Fair Value originally assigned to the Petrol Stations as of \n31 December 2016 averaged  approximately US$ 1 million.  \n40. With respect to the Market Approach, I have been able to identify numerous transactions \nbetween 2013 and 2016 in Eastern Europe, including Ukraine, involving petrol stations or \npetrol station networks .  The weighted average and simple average of these tran sactions are \nUS$ 1.1 million and  US$ 1.5 million , respectively .  Of particular note is a transaction involving \n240 petrol stations in Ukraine sold by Lukoil in April 2015 to AMIC Energy.   Lukoil sold these \npetrol stations, as well as the rest of its petrol stations in Eastern Europe, as a consequence of \nnegative Russian sentiment which followed Russia’s annexation of Crimea.  Eastern \nEuropeans boycotted Russian petrol stations causing Lukoil stations to generate losses.  As \nsuch, Lukoil’s sales of its petrol station networks in Eastern Europe including Ukraine were \nall distressed sales.  Despite the distressed nature of these sales, Lukoil’s 240 petrol stations in \nUkraine were acquired for US$ 300 million or US$ 1.25 million per station.  In contrast, Mr. \nBezant values the 246 Petrol Stations at a n average of just US$ 300,000 per station.  None of \nD21/1/17\nPage 12 \n the transactions I identified indicates petrol stations were sold or acquired for an average \namount of only US$ 300,000.  In fact, almost every transaction took pla ce at an average price \nper station that exceeded US$ 1 million.   Several transactions took place at an average price \nwhich exceeded US$ 2 million per station.   Given the robust transaction data I have gathered, \nI believe it is reasonable to conclude that t he average Fair Value of the 246 Petrol Stations \nwould be US$ 1.25 million as of 31 December 2016 (the average distressed price of the 240 \nLukoil petrol stations). \n41. To arrive at a final Fair Value conclusion, I have averaged my valuation results under the \nIncome and Market Approaches .  I have then converted the amount to UAH at the 31 December \n2016 exchange rate of 27.187 UAH/USD.  Accordingly, my Fair Value conclusion for the 246 Petrol Stations is UAH 8.4 44 billion.  \nD. Summary of My Valuation of the OSFs  \n42. Unlike Mr. Bezant, I have accepted that the capacity and throughput data of the OSFs provided \nto Baker Tilly is accurate information.   Given that 80 to 85 percent of fuel is imported into \nUkraine from either Russia or Belarus, OSFs are needed by petrol stations to ensure an \nuninterrupted supply of fuel.  Mr. Bezant appears to overlook this logistical necessity.  If the \n72 OSFs were not operational in 2019, as Mr. Bezant indicates, the 246 Petrol Stations would \nbe paying third parties for storage rather than usi ng the storage assets owned by the Bank.  This \nis not economically rational.  I agree that the 2016 operational status of the 72 OSFs is a  factual \nmatter .  However, given that petrol stations need intermediate storage facilities, I believe it is \nmore reasonable to assume the 72 OSFs were operational rather than non -operational.  \n43. I have valued the OSFs using the Income Approach and the throughput  and capacity  \ninformation made available to Baker Tilly.   I have also utilized data that was provided to me \nwhen I valued two OSFs in Crimea in a previous international arbitration.  Specifically, that \ndata revealed the OSFs typically charge 1.5 percent of the wholesa le price of petrol for storage.   \nOverall, my Income Approach resulted in a Fair Value of  US$ 87,189,028 or UAH 2.370 \nbillion as of 31 December 2016 for the 72 OSFs.   This amount is approximately 58 percent \nless than the Original 2016 Fair Value assigned by the Bank of UAH 5.685 billion.  Howe"}

Overall Fair Value Conclusions  \n44. Table 1 below is a s ummary of the various 2016 Fair Value conclusions for the 246 Petrol \nStations and 72 OSFs.  As Table 1 reveals, Mr. Bezant’s valuation conclusion is consistent \nwith the R estated 2016 Fair Values and substantially lower than the Original 2016 Fair Values.  \nMy Fair Value conclusion for the 246 Petrol Stations is approximately 31 percent higher than \nthe Original 2016 Fair Values .  However, my Fair Value conclusion for the 72 OSFs is \napproximately 58 percent lower than the Original 2016 Fair Values.  In total, my Fair Value \nconclusions for both the 246 Petrol Stations and 72 OSFs is approximately 10 percent less than \nthe Original 2016 Fair Values. \nTable 1 -  Summary of Valuation Conclusions for the 246 Petrol Stations and 72 OSFs  \n \n All Petrol Station Valuations After 2016 ( including the Restated 2016 Fair \nValues) are Notional  \n45. I have reviewed several of the valuation reports prepared by valuers retained to determine the Fair Value of the Petrol Station Assets for PrivatBank.  I have also reviewed Mr. Bezant’s \ndescription of the methodologies and data utilized by the valuers and generally concur with his \ndescription of the same.

I have nine comments on the data and valuation methods utilized by the valuers in Table 2  \nabove.  \n47. First, the only Fair Value calculations performed by valuers using actual financial and \noperational data provided by the previous enterprise owners related to the Petrol Stations are \nthe original valuations performed in 2016.  The valuers performing the Fair Value calculations \nof the Petrol Stations in 2016 (Baker Tilly, UCE, and Ver itas) were provided with fuel sales \nvolumes, fuel revenues, concession revenues, and operating costs for 2015 and the 2016 H1.  The valuers then all implemented the Income Approach (DCF) and in the case of UCE also the \nIncome Capitalization Approach.  \n48. Secon d, for the 2017 Fair Value calculations, PrivatBank retained 5 entirely new valuers: \nExpert+, Business Partners LLC, Synex, CBA, and Expertgarant.  I find this fact to be rather \nodd.  Typically, a company will use the same firm(s) utilized in the previous year to remeasure \nFair Value given all the work that had previously been done.  In essence, all the previous \nvaluers had to do was update their valuation models by incorporating up to date operational \nand financial information from the Petrol Stations.  By retaining 5 entirely new valuation firms, \neach firm would have to go through the exercise of performing the Fair Value calculations de novo rather than having the previous valuation firms update their valuation models.

Third, all 5 of the new valuation fi rms in 2017 refused to use the actual financial and \noperational data that had been provided to the 3 valuation firms in 2016.  The valuers either \nadjusted the fuel sales volumes downward significantly or conducted surveys. Again, I find \nthis fact to be odd.  None of the valuation firms seems to have provided any rationale for \nrejecting or adjusting the actual data provided in 2015 and 2016.  I cannot recall an instance in \nany of my valuation work where I rejected or adjusted financial and operational data p rovided \nto me by a client.  No doubt I have raised questions about certain data provided to me by a \nclient from time to time and the data had to be supplemented or corrected.  However, I cannot \nrecall any instance of outright rejection of the data.  Certai nly, if I were to reject or significantly \nmodify the data, I would provide my client with very specific reasons for doing so.  It does not appear that the 2017 valuers did so.  Moreover , I find it odd that all 5 valuers rejected the data \nas provided.  For such an occurrence to happen, I assume  that the valuers were all informed \nthat the historical financial and operational data was not reliable.   I have not been shown any \ndocument in disclosure that explains why the historical financial and operational  data supplied \nto the valuation firms in 2016 was not considered reliable , and Mr. Bezant does not identify \nany such document.  \n50. Fourth, the 2017 valuers were not provided with any updated operational or financial data for \nany of the Petrol Stations in 2016 2H or  2017. \n51. Fifth, only 123 valuation reports were submitted by Claimant pertaining to the Fair Value calculations for 2017.  It is unclear how Privat Bank established Fair Values for the remaining \n123 Petrol Stations at year end 2017.  Likewise, for the 2018 Fa ir Value calculations, only 12 \nPetrol Station Fair Value calculations were provided (4 from Expert+ and 8 from Volyn).  It is \nunclear how the remaining 234 Petrol Stations were valued to support the Fair Values in \nPrivatBank’s balance sheet at year end 2018.  As I noted in Section V  of my First Report , the \nFair Value of all Transferred Assets (excluding the Aircraft Assets) was reduced to a mere UAH 1,361 million from UAH 17,181 million, a reduction of a pproximately 92 percent.  \n52.

Sixth, with respect to the 2016 restated Fair Value calculations, the valuers Expert+ and Volyn \nwere retained.  It does not appear that Volyn was provided with historical financial and \noperational data for the Petrol Stations from 2015 and 2016.  Absent using actual financial and \noperational information from the Petrol Stations to be valued, the valuers had to once again \nD21/1/21\nPage 16 \n utilize notional (i.e., theoretical) or proxy data.  With respect to Volyn, they allegedly \nmonitored a set of “comparable” Petrol Stations in 2018 to obtain fuel volum e estimates.5  \nThese 2018 volumes were then rolled back to 2016 with a 95 percent adjustment factor.6 Thus, \nthe approach is dependent upon ex- post data rather than ex -ante data as of 31 December 2016.  \nIt is generally prohibited to use information that i s not known or knowable at the valuation date \nwhen conducting a Fair Value (or Market Value or FMV) calculation (see Section VI  below ).  \nNevertheless, I f ind it odd that Volyn would opt to monitor fuel sales volumes at “comparable” \nPetrol Stations rather than a subset or sample of the actual Petrol Stations to be valued.  There \ndoes not appear to be any logic behind monitoring fuel sales at Petrol Stations that are not the \nsubject of the Fair Value calculations.  \n53. Seventh, I note that Mr. Bezant has identified  the number of fuel pumps at each of the 246 \nPetrol Stations from the Volyn and Expert+ reports.7  I am not certain how this data was \nobtained.  If Volyn and Expert+ obtaine d this data from site visits, it is unclear why actual \nfinancial and operational data was not obtained at the same time (if available at the station \nlevel).  Nevertheless, neither I nor Mr. Bezant can confirm this information without conducting \nsite visits  to each station ourselves.  \n54. Eighth, I have not been able to confirm the manner in which Volyn’s field study of fuel sales volumes of “comparable” petrol stations was applied to the subject Petrol Stations.  \nPresumably this has been done by number of pumps.  It is also unclear  whether or how Volyn \nconsidered the location of each Petrol Station .  They should have done so, since location is a \nprimary factor affecting traffic and fuel sales volumes.  \n55. Ninth, with respect to Expert+, they apparently utilized the s ame data that was utilized to \nconduct their 2017 Fair Value calculations.  I note Mr. Bezant is unable to determine how \nExpert+ has derived their fuel sales volumes for either the 2017 Fair Value calculations for 31 \nPetrol Stations they valued or the 2016 Fair Value calculations for 48 Petrol Stations they \nvalued.  \n“However, as explained in Appendix 10, although the volumes \nunderlying the Expert+ Restated PS Reports are comparable to the \n \n5 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, ¶A7.47.  \n6 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, ¶A7.47.  \n7 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, footnote 142.  \nD21/1/22\nPage 17 \n volumes underlying the Volyn Expert Restated PS Report and the \nother re ference points I have considered, I am unable to determine \nhow they were derived.

In his own valuation of the Petrol Stations in 2016, Mr. Bezant also declines to utilize the actual \n2015/2016 H1 financial and operational data provided by the enterprise owners.  Mr. Bezant \nhas provided a cross -check of the fuel sales volumes provided by the enterprise owners for \n2016.  He compares the a verage fuel volumes sold per station per year as reported by the \nenterprise owners, and as utilized in the 2016 restated Fair Value calculations performed by \nVolyn, with those of other retail pe trol networks as reported by Naftogaz.  A copy of Mr. \nBezant’s  cross -check analysis is provided in Table 3 below. \nTable 3 – Mr. Bezant’s Fuel Sales Volume Cross -Check9 \n \n \n8 Bezant Transferred Asset Report, ¶  A8.21.  \n9 Bezant Transferred Asset Report, Appendix 10a, tab “Naftogaz”.

The fuel sales volumes utilized in \nthe restated 2016 Fair Value calculations is 557 tons per station per year (i.e., 58% lower).  The \naverage fuel sales volumes per station per year for other retail petrol networks as calculated by \nMr. Bezant is also provided in Table 3 above.  The implicit conclusion drawn by Mr. Bezant \nfrom this cross check is that the data provided by the enterprise owners is not reliable  and that \nVolyn was justified in discarding it. \n59. I cannot comment on the accuracy of the data in Mr. Bezant’s cross check.  However, I would \npoint out that a more simple and reliable cross check could have been performed.  Mr. Bezant \ncould have obtained the actual sales volumes of the 246 Petrol Stations from Privat Bank, even \nif only for years subsequent to 2016 to ascertain the fuel volumes each station typically sold. \nMr. Bezant did not obtain this data, however.   He does not explain why not, and that \ninformation is not available to me as I understand it has not been di sclosed.  \n60. I have performed an alternative type of cross check.

Nevertheless, without alternative actual data from Pri vatBank or the Petrol Stations, I do not \nbelieve it is appropriate to assume the level fuel sales volumes for every Petrol Station in the \nmanner put forward by Volyn and relied upon by Mr. Bezant.  In fact, the valuations Volyn \nand Mr. Bezant have performed of the Petrol Stations are not based upon any specific \noperational or financial information related to the Petrol Stations at all.  All such data is \nassumed.  As such, I would regard Volyn’s valuation and Mr. Bezant’s valuation (and all other \nvaluations pertaining to the Petrol Stations after the original 2016 valuations) to be notional.

However, as far as I can tell from the available information, the Petrol Stations we re \nactual operating assets and should be valued based upon their specific operational and financial \nperformance.  They should not be value d “in theory” using entirely assumed operational and \nfinancial data.       \n PrivatBank Does Not Appear to Have Managed the Petrol Stations or \nOSFs \n63. The transfer of 246 Petrol Stations and 72 OSFs to the Bank provided Privat Bank with one of \nthe largest networ ks of retail petrol stations  in the country.  Upon the transfer of the Petrol \nStations and OSFs to PrivatBank, I would have expected the Bank to take the following \nactions:  \na. Establish a new legal entity under which the Petrol Stations and OSFs would be plac ed \nb. Appoint or hire a management team  \nc. Perform site visits to each Petrol Station  and OSF  to inspect its  physical condition  \nd. Obtain historical financial and operational data pertaining to each asset (if not from \nthe Petrol Stations and OSFs themselves, then  from the previous enterprise owners)  \ne. Set up int ernal controls to monitor daily activities such as purchases and fuel sales \nvolumes, inventory accounting, and cash management  \nf. Establish financial reporting systems to be able to  measure the performance of each \nPetrol Station and OSF, including the profit generated by each asset  \n64. In order to maximize the sale of these assets, I would have further expected t he Bank to take \nthe following strategic actions:  \na.

This would include erecting convenience \nstores on those sites that lacked one or expanding the existing convenience store  \nd. Negotiating with suppliers as a single entity to obtain volume discounts  \n65. As far as I can ascertain, none of the above activities were undertaken by PrivatBank.  Instead, PrivatBank seems not to have managed the Petrol Stations or OSFs at all.  They have not been \nable to provide Mr. Bezant or any of the valuers  with operational and financial data for any \nPetrol Stations or OSFs.   Indeed, it seems as if PrivatBank does not know  what amount of \nprofit these assets are generating.   The apparent managerial neglect may explain why the Fair \nValue of the Petrol Stations, OSFs, and Real Estate was  remeasured at just UAH 1,361 million, \n8 percent of the original values (UAH 14,627  million)  in 2018.  It may also explain why the \nvaluers of the OSFs for the 2016 restated Fair Values (Volyn, Expert+, and AE) indicated that \n71 of the 72 OSFs were not operational  in 2019.\n10  Assets do not manage themselves. \n My Comments on Mr. Bezant’s Valuation of the Petrol Stations  \n66. In this Section, I provide my comments on Mr. Bezant’s valuation of the 246 Petrol Stations that were transferred to the Bank in 2016.  In subsection A, I summarize Mr. Bezant’s value \nconclusions for the Petrol Stations.  In subsection B, I discuss what I consider to be three key \nerrors in Mr. Bezant’s Income Approach .  In subsection C, I show the impact of correcting \nthese three errors on t he value conclusions produced by Mr. Bezant’s DCF Model. \nA. Summary of Mr. Bezant’s Value Conclusions  \n67. Mr. Bezant uses the Income  Approach to value each of the 246 Petrol Stations as of 1 July \n2016, the approximate midpoint of the period during which the Petrol Stations were transferred \nto the Bank.\n11  Table 5 below summarizes the key inputs to Mr. Bezant’s DCF model. \n \n10 Bezant Transferred Asset Report, ¶ 5.36.  \n11 Bezant T ransferred Assets Report, ¶ 4.49.  \nD21/1/27\nPage 22 \n Table 5 – Key Parameters Used in Mr. Bezant’s Petrol Station DCF Model12 \n \n68. Based on the parameters shown above, Mr. Bezant values the 246 Petrol Stations at UAH 1.9 \nbillion, or an average value of UAH 7.6 million per station.13  This value conclusion is 71 \npercent lower than the Fair Values at which the Petrol Stations were originally recognized in \nthe Bank’s financial statements.14   \n69. Mr. Bezant also presents an alternative valuation which makes use of data provided to the original valuers in 2016.  In this alternative scenario, Mr. Bezant concludes a value of UAH \n5.0 billion for the Petrol Stations, approximately 22 percent lower than the originally \nrecognized Fair V alues.\n15 \nB. Errors In Mr. Bezant’s Valuation of the Petrol Stations Using the Income  \nApproach  \n70. I agree with Mr. Bezant that the Petrol Stations are well suited to the Income Approach and, in general, I find most of his assumptions to be reasonable.

First, I do not agree with Mr. Bezant that the sales volume data provided to the original valuers \nin 2016 should be ignored in favor of the sales volumes set out in the restated Volyn Report.  \nSecond, I disagree with Mr. Bezant’s  projection of capital expenditures, which are designed to \nforce the Petrol Stations toward a specific RONIC.  Third, the country risk premium for \nUkraine that Mr. Bezant incorporates into the Petrol Stations’ cost of equity is , in my view, too \nhigh.  I di scuss each of these three items in the following subsections.  I am also of the view \nthat the Income Approach should be constructed in US dollars  rather than UAH given the fact \nthe oil and oil product derivatives are all traded with reference to the US dollar.  However, I \nwill address this issue in Section VII . \ni. Mr. Bezant Ignores Contemporaneous Sales Volume Data  \n72. Mr. Bezant correctly identifies th at there is a large difference between the sales volumes \nunderlying the original valuations conducted in 2016 and those underlying the restated 2016 \nvaluations  conducted in 2019.  Mr. Bezant performed a number of cross checks and concluded \nthat the volumes  underlying the restated 2016 valuations are more likely to be accurate than \nthe volumes underlying the original 2016 valuations.16  Therefore, his primary valuation \nscenario relie s upon the sales volumes contained  in the restated 2016 valuations.  I disag ree \nwith Mr. Bezant’s approach for three reasons.  \n73. First, as discussed in detail in Section I II, the volumes on which Mr. Bezant r elies are entirely \nnotional, i.e., they are not related to the Petrol Stations themselves but are instead based on \nfield studi es of comparable petrol stations . \n74. Second, the volumes contained in the re stated 2016 valuations are derived from information \nthat was not known or knowable as of Mr. Bezant’s valuation date in July 2016.  Specifically, the Volyn volumes are based on data f rom 2018 that are adjusted backwards in time to 2016.\n17 \nAs discussed in Section VI  below , a cardinal rule of valuation is that a practitioner should rely \nonly on information that was known or knowable as of the valuation date.  Mr. Bezant’s \nreliance on the Volyn volumes clearly violates this princip le. \n \n16 Bezant Transferred Assets  Report, ¶ 4.61.  \n17 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, Appendix 7, Table A7- 4. \nD21/1/29\nPage 24 \n 75.

Third, I was provided with monthly sales volumes and revenues by fuel type for the Petrol \nStations covering the period between January 2015 and June 2016.18  It appears that this  is the \nsame data that was given to UCE when it prepared its original 2016 valuation of the Petrol \nStations.  I have no reason to believe that these historical sales records are in authentic  or \nunreliable.  I understand that this data was only provided to C laimant, and thus Mr. Bezant, \nafter the submission of Mr. Bezant’s  expert report on 24 November 2021.  Therefore, I do not \nknow whether access to this historical sales information will alter Mr. Bezant’s views as to the \nsales volumes that should be used in his primary valuation scenario. \nii. Mr. Bezant’s RONIC Adjustment is Economically and Logically Unsound \n76. The second error in Mr. Bezant’s DCF M odel relates  to his modeling of capital expenditures  \nand his focus on the Petrol Stations’ RONIC.  Mr. Bezant explains his approach as follows:  \n“I consider that competition in the industry means the Petrol Stations \nwill be unable to achieve returns substantially in excess of the cost \nof financing in the long- run. Therefore, I assume that in the long-\nrun the return on new invested capital (“ RONIC ”) wi ll reach 18.5%, \nrepresenting my assessment of the cost of capital plus a premium of 1%.\n The changes that result in the RONIC reaching this level could \nmanifest in a number of ways, for example through reduced \nmargins, increased capital expenditure, or an i ncrease in working \ncapital. For computational convenience, I implement it by assuming capital expenditure will increase annually until the RONIC has reached 18.5%. ”\n19  \n77. I have four comments  on Mr. Bezant’s application of his “RONIC”  concept described above \nin his modeling of the Petrol Stations’ cash flows. \n78. First, RONIC is primarily a  capital budgeting tool, not an artificial restraint on profitability .  \nWhen a business is at the point of deciding whether or not to invest further capital in the firm, \nit will compare the expected returns associated with the incremental investment with the cap ital \noutlay.  If the projected return exceeds the cost of capital, the firm will proceed with the investment .  Mr. Bezant essentially confuses cau se and effect: cap ital expenditures are not  \nmade in order to reduce RONIC .  Instead  RONIC may naturally decrease when capital \nexpenditures are made to grow the business in an economically profitable manner.  In Mr. \n \n18 Appendix D.7. \n19 Bezant Transferred Assets Report , ¶ 4.73.  \nD21/1/30\nPage 25 \n Bezant’s DCF M odel, he assumes  that the P etrol Stations require  increasing capital investment, \nbut do not realize any specific economic benefits associated with th ose investments  such as  \nincreased sales volume or increased profitability. Instead , growth is linked only to general \neconomic activity  in Ukraine and the price of crude oil.   \n79. Previously, when valuing networks of petrol stations in Crimea, I was provided with \nmanagement plans and budgets associated with renovations to those stations.  My valuation of \nthose stations included an expected increase in sales volumes of approximately 200 percent or \nmore following the completion of the renovation.20  I find Mr. Bezant’s assumption that the \nPetrol Stations would make investments that did not have a direct economic return to be illogical.   \n80. Second, while I agree with Mr. Bezant that,  in many industries, a business is unlikely to earn \nreturns significantly in excess of its cost of capital over an extended period of time, I do"}

Second, while I agree with Mr. Bezant that,  in many industries, a business is unlikely to earn \nreturns significantly in excess of its cost of capital over an extended period of time, I do not \nagree that this princip le necessarily applies  to the Petrol Stations.  The profitability of a petrol \nstation is highly dependent upon its location.  When geographic location is  a key driver of \nprofitability, this can present a buffer or impediment against new market entrants and provide \na long- term competitive advantage .  Therefore, I do not believe that it is neces sary to artificially \nrestrain the profitability of the Petrol Stations  as Mr. Bezant has done with his RONIC \nadjustment .  Instead, each component of the Petrol Stations ’ free cash flows should be \nprojected based on the best expectations as of the valuation date.  \n81. Third, w hen modeling cash flows, valuation practitioners commonly  assume that  capital \nexpenditures and depreciation will converge  in the long run, i.e., only maintenance capital \nexpenditures are required  to operate the business . Under this assumption, new invested capital , \ndefined by Mr. Bezant as capex less depreciation, is zero .  If incremental returns are positive, \nthen RONIC is infinite (or undefined) .  Mr. Bezant  has not offered any expla nation why, in the \nlong run, the Petrol Stations’ capital expenditures would significantly exceed annual \ndepreciation charges.  \n82. Fourth, from a mechanical perspective, I do not understand why Mr. Bezant’s DCF M odel \nassumes a flat depreciation charge despite a cont inual increase in capital expenditures \n \n20 See, for example, Ukrnafta  station no. 2, for which sales volumes were projected to increase from 693 tonnes in \n2013 to 1,896 tonnes in 2015. Ukrnafta v. The Russian Federation, DCF Model, p. 10. (BK-49) \nD21/1/31\nPage 26 \n throughout his forecast period.  I would expect annual depreciation  expenses to increase as \nnew capital assets are added to the balance sheet more rapidly than existing assets are \ndepreciated.  Again, this appears to be an artifact of Mr. Bezant’s choice to include his RONIC \nadjustment by way of capital expenditures for “computational convenience” rather than for any \neconomic ally sound reason. \niii. Mr. Bezant’s Discount Rate Includes an Overstated Country Risk Premium  \n83. When calculating the discount rate for the Petrol Stations, Mr. Bezant includes a country risk \npremium of 7.6 percent in the cost of equity.21  As discussed in further detail in Section VII  \nbelow, a country risk pre mium captures the Petrol Stations’ incremental  risk exposure due to \ntheir location in Ukraine rather than a developed market such as the United States  or United \nKingdom .  For his assumption regarding the country risk premium, Mr. Bezant’s relies on a \nfigure  published by Duff & Phelps that is calculate d using the  country yield spread model.22  \n84. Mr. Bezant’s  proposed measure of country risk is flawed because it is  generic in nature and \ndoes not consider the specific risks to which the Petrol Stations  are exposed in Ukraine .  The \nCountry Yield Spread Model estimates the country risk premium by calculating the difference \nbetween the yield on a foreign country’s US dollar denominated bonds and the yield on US \nTreasury bonds.23  The  sovereign bond yield, however, is a broad measure of a state’s solvency \nand economic health and a measure of the credit and default risk associated with a country’s \ngovernment bonds .  This default risk and other elements of the sovereign bond yield are often \nunrelated to the risks faced by equity investments in private, commerc ial enterprises, like the \nPetrol Stat"}

This default risk and other elements of the sovereign bond yield are often \nunrelated to the risks faced by equity investments in private, commerc ial enterprises, like the \nPetrol Stations .  Therefore, the sovereign bond yield is not a good proxy for the country risk \nfaced by such investments. \n85. Consistent with my  explanation, a 2012 study by professors from Duke  University, Columbia  \nUniversity , the University of North Carolina, and The University of Washington concluded \nthat: \n“[O]n average, only one third of the sovereign spread reflects \npolitical risk. A cost of capital adjustment that simply ‘ adds’ the \nentire spread therefore double counts global sys tematic risk \n \n21 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, Appendix 5, Table A5 -2. \n22 Bezant Transferr ed Assets Report, Appendix 5, ¶ A5.21.  \n23 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, Appendix 5, ¶ A5.20.  \nD21/1/32\nPage 27 \n exposures such as economic and financial conditions that should \nalready be reflected in the discount rate. A full spread adjustment \nfurther reduces the value of the project by including local \nmacroeconomic conditions that should be reflected i n the expected \ncash flows as well as bond market liquidity that is likely irrelevant \nto the value of the project.”24 \n86. The idea that country risk cannot be uniformly applied to all companies is supported by leading \nvaluation practitioners.  For example, a Sa lomonSmithBarney study rightly identifies that the \npolitical risk premium for a country (as measured by a bond spread or some other metric) is often not a good indicator of the risks faced by an individual project in that country:  \n“While many practitioner s use the political risk premium, it is hard \nto find a clear description of what this premium really represents and \nthere is no strong theoretical foundation for its use. In fact, there are certain limitations to the use of the political risk premium, including the following: (1) sovereign bond spreads are good indicators of an investor’s (or market’s) required returns and expectations for certain government bonds –  but they are susceptible to various market \nfluctuations, news, international capital flows, etc., that may or may not be strongly correlated with the returns required by a European food company investing in a tomato plant in the stable Korean food market; and (2) the likelihood that a government of a country will \nmeet its debt obligations, which is what the sovereign debt ratings are supposed to measure, may not necessarily be related to the riskiness of a project in that country. A good example is Botswana and Japan, which currently have the same ratings but may be perceived as having very differ ent levels of risk associated with \ninvesting and operating a business in each country. Some adjustments that we propose later in this report address this issue.”\n25 \n87. Professors Godfrey and Espinosa from Bank of America also state that the use of benchmarks \nin developing the cost of equity is no substitute for a careful evaluation of the specifics of a \ncompany or project.  \n“Finally, because estimating equity premia and costs of capital are \nchallenging tasks even for projects located in industrial countries, let alone for emerging markets where data is likely to be scarce, this \nframework is intended to generate only rough benchmarks for evaluating emerging market projects.  The use of risk -adjusted \n \n24 Bekaert, Geert, Campbell R. Harvey, Christian T. Lundblad, Stephan Siegel, “ Political Risk and International \nValuation, ” March 2012, p. 2.

Similarly, S&P Capital IQ explains that sovereign bond ratings, which underpin the sovereign \nspread used by Mr. Bezant , are an unreliable proxy for country risk for companies operating \nin a particular country:  \n“[W]e understand many analysts use sovereign debt ratings as a \nproxy for country risk despite the fact that credit rating agencies do \nnot intend their sovereign debt ratings to speak to country risk \nbecause these two risk sources are conceptually distinct […]  \n \nWe believe that sovereign risk is an increasingly poor proxy for country risk in many instances. We expect that credit modeling expediency based solely on sovereign debt ratings may not fully reflect economic reality.”\n27 \n89. This concept is repeated by Standard & Poor’s, which is one of the major pr oviders of \nsovereign credit ratings, in its description of how its sovereign bond ratings should (and should \nnot) be used:  \n“A Standard & Poor’s sovereign rating is:  \n• A current opinion of the creditworthiness of a sovereign \ngovernment, where creditworthiness  pertains largely to the \ntimely service of debt.  \nA Standard & Poor’s sovereign rating is not: \nA country risk rating or country investment ranking .”28 \n[emphasis added]  \n90.

Mr. Bezant’s  measure of the country r isk premium in the cost of equity calculation (i.e., 7.6 \npercent ) is based upon sovereign spread between Ukrainian  bonds and US Treasury bonds  \ndespite all the aforementioned criticisms of such an approach.  In my view, the risks of \noperating a petrol stati on in Ukraine versus a  developed economy does not warrant a 7.6 \npercent increase in the cost of equity.

My Modifications to Mr. Bezant’s DCF Model  \n92. In order to correct the three errors described above , I made three basic changes to Mr. Bezant’s \nDCF M odel.   \n93. First, I selected Mr. Bezant’s alternative valuation scenario that incorporated the sales volume \ndate presented to UCE in 2016.  In isolation, t his change increases the value conclusion for the \nPetrol Stations from UAH 1.9 billion to UAH 5.0 billion.30   \n94. Second, I altered Mr. Bezant’s model to remove the assumption that capital expenditures are \nlinked to a specific RONIC  level.  Instead, I set capital expenditures  equal to depreciation, \nunder the assumption that only maintenance capital expenditures are incurred by the Petrol \nStations.  In isolation, this change increases the value conclusion for the Petr ol Stations from \nUAH 1.9 billion to UAH 2.4 billion.  \n95. Finally, I decreased the  discount rate by 2.5 percent, equal to the impact on the Petrol Stations’ \nWeighted Average Cost of Capital (“WACC ”) of reducing the country risk premium from 7.6 \n \n29 Bekaert, Geert, Harvey, Campbell, Lundblad, Christian and Siegel, Stephan, \"Political Risk and International \nValuation,\" March 2012,  p. 39.

In isolation, this change increases the value conclusion for the Petrol \nStations from UAH 1.9 billion to UAH 2.2 billion.  \n96. After making these three changes  in combination, Mr. Bezant’s D CF Model produces a n \nadjusted  value conclusion of UAH 7. 9 billion, nearly  UAH 1 .6 billion higher than the Fair \nValues for the Petrol Stations originally recorded on the Bank’s 2016 financial statements  of \nUAH 6.3 billion.31 \n Mr. Bezant Inappropriate ly Values the OSFs Using Hindsight  \n97. It is a cardinal rule in valuation practice that only information known or knowable as of the \nvaluation can factor into the analysis.  This is embodied in the IVS that Mr. Bezant purports to \nfollow. \n“The assumed date of a transaction will influence what information \nand data a valuer considers in a valuat ion. Most bases of value \nprohibit the consideration of information or market sentiment that \nwould not be known or knowable with reasonable due diligence on the measurement/valuation date by participants.”\n32 \n98. To value the OSFs, Mr. Bezant relies upon auction  prices for 42 OSFs that PrivatBank sold \nbetween July 2019 and October  2021.  \n“Since I use the prices at which some of the OSFs were sold at auction for my valuation, I therefore value the OSFs on an unencumbered basis.”\n33 \n99. Mr. Bezant is cognizant that his valuation is based upon information that was not known or \nknowable at his valuation date of 1 July 2016.  \n“I recognise that my valuation is subject to important limitations. In \nparticular:  \n(1) it relies on information that was not known or knowable as at the  \nValuation Date (such as the auction prices);”34 \n \n31 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, Appendix 9. To obtain th e value of UAH 7.9 billion, recalculate the Petrol Station \nvalues after making the following alterations to the DCF model: 1) change the valuation scenario to “UCE Data” in \ncell D 16 on the “Assumptions” tab, 2) change the discount rate  from 17.5 percent to 15 percent in cell D19 on t he \nAssumption” tab, and 3) set capex equal to depreciation in cells  F73:J73 on the “Model support” tab.  \n32 International Valuation Standards, Effective 31 January 2020, ¶ 10.5 .

In my view, Mr. Bezant’s use of information not known or knowable at his  valuation date \nrenders his valuation analysis non- compliant with the Market Value standard he was instructed \nto implement and unusable  as an alternative value.   It is obvious that a valuer seeking to \nmeasure Market Value as of 1 July 2016 could not have had knowledge of auction prices from \n2019- 2021.   \n101. Moreover, the state of the OSFs  may have materially changed between his valuation date \nand the auction dates.  Yet, Mr. Bezant assumes there was no change.  \n“[I] assumes that the OSFs’ value did not change significantly \nbetween 2016 and 2019.  In doing so, I also assume that the \ncondition and status of the OSFs did not change significantly between 2016 and 2019 (and therefore the OSFs’ condition and status implied in the auction amounts in 2019 reflect their condition and status in 2016)”\n35 \n102. In essence, Mr. Bezant’s assumption is that the OSFs were not operational .  As he indicates, \nthe valuers retained to determine the restated 2016 Fair Values for the OSFs (Expert+, Volyn, \nand AE) apparently determined that 71 of the 72 OSFs were not operational in 2019.36  If the \nOSFs were indeed not ope rating in 2019, the auction prices would reflect distressed asset \nvalues and any buyer would need to bring them back into operation and reestablish customers.   \nFurther, i f the OSFs were indeed not operating, one has to query which third- party OSFs were \nsupplying the 246 Petrol Stations.  As Ukraine imports 80- 85 percent of its fuel needs, OSFs \nare needed by petrol stations to maintain an uninterrupted supply.37  If 71 of the 72 OSFs were \nnot operational in 2019, the Petrol Stations would be paying third -parties for the storage and \ndelivery of fuels rather than using the OSFs owned by PrivatBank.  This d efies rational \neconomic behavior.   \n103. As I have explained above, it does not appear that PrivatBank ex erted any managerial control \nover the OSFs after they were transferred to the Bank.  If they had ex erted any managerial \ncontrol, the Bank would know if the OSFs were operational in 2016/2017 and would have \n \n35 Bezant Transferred Asset Report, ¶ 5.73. \n36 Bezant Transferred Asset Report, ¶ 5.36. \n37 Wojciech Kononczuk, “A dangerous  energy policy: Ukraine, despite war, is making itself dependent on Russian \nOil,” 8 September 2017. (BK-20) \nD21/1/37\nPage 32 \n operational and financial data concerning their use after (and even before) 2016.  However, \nMr. Bezant state s that he was not provided with any of this information. \n“Importantly, however, I have not been provided with:  \n(1) the OSFs’ historical financial information; \n(2) the OSFs’ forecast financial performance; and/ or  \n(3) the age of these OSFs (which may be relevant to whether they \nwere obsolete in 2016).”38 \n104. I agree with Mr. Bezant that knowing the operational status of the OSFs is important .  The \noperational (and financial) information about the OSFs is also important.  However, \nPrivatBank has obviously not sought to obtain operational or financial information about the  \nOSFs transferred to it  even for period when these assets were owned by the Bank .  As such, \nthe only information in the record concerning the operational status of each OSF in 2016 is \nthat whic h was provided to Baker Tilly to value the OSFs in 2016.

As the Petrol Stations are not actively traded on an exchange, a Level 1 valuation is not \npossible.  Accordingly, a valuation technique must be employed to determine Fair Value.  I have been able to implement two valuation techniques to determine the Fair Value of the Petrol \nStations: 1) the Income Approach, and 2) the Market Approach.  I explain my imple mentation \nof each approach an d my resulting Fair Value conclusions in subsections A and B, respectively.   \nIn subsection C, I then consider which technique maximizes the use of observable inputs and \nrepresents the best measure of Fair Value.   Finally, in subsection D, I perform my own cross \ncheck of the Fair Value I have determined for the 246 Petrol Stations.  \n106. Whether each  valuation technique yields a value compliant with Level 2 or Level 3 depends \nupon the degree of reliance upon unobservable inputs.  As I have explained in Section III  of \nmy First Report , the categorization of a valuation technique as Level 2 or 3 requires some \n \n38 Bezant Transferred Asset Report, ¶ 5.14. \nD21/1/38\nPage 33 \n professional judgement.  In my view, both the Income Approach and Market Approaches I \nhave implemented would be best categorized as a Level 3 Fair Value determination.  \nA. Income Approach  \n107. I use the Income  Approach to value the network of 246 petrol stations that were transferred \nto the Bank in 2016.  My discussion of the Income A pproach is divided in the following four \nsubsections: 1) the free cash flow projections for the Petrol Stations, 2) the discount ra te, 3) \nthe terminal value calculation, and 4) a summary of my F air Value conclusion under the \nIncome  Approach.  \ni. Free Cash Flow Projections  \n108. The first component of the Income A pproach is the free cash flow that the Petrol Stations \nwould have been expected to generate over my explicit 5 -year forecast period from 1 January \n2017 to 31 December 2021, followed by a terminal value calculation that captures the value of \nthe Petrol Stations’ operations after 2021.  There are four components to my free cash flow \nprojec tion: 1) revenues, 2) costs, 3) capital expenditures, and 4) changes in net working capital. \nRevenues  \n109. The first component of my cash flow projection is revenue. The Petrol Stations’ revenues \ndepend on three inputs: 1) the volume of fuel sold, 2) the sale price of fuel, and 3) other \nrevenues which are derived from sales made in convenience stores.39  \nSales Volumes  \n110. The Petrol Stations sold four types of fuel: two grades of gasoline (A -92 and A -95), diesel \nfuel, and LPG.40  I have been provided with documentat ion of the monthly sales volumes, by \nfuel type, for each of the Petrol Stations.41  This historical data I received covers the period \nbetween January 2015 and June 2016.  My review of this data indicates that it appears to show \nthe same sales volume figures that were given to UCE and Veritas, two of the firms retained \nto conduct the original 2016 valuations of the Petrol Stations.

In order to project 2017 sales volumes, I grossed up the volumes from the first half of 2016 \nby a factor of 2.1, to account for the seasonality of fuel sales observed in the Ukrainian \nmarket.43  Mr. Bezant makes t he same assumption in his valuation of the Petrol Stations.44 \n112. I assume that the Petrol Stations will, on average, continue to sell the same product mix as \nwas sold in the first half of 2016.  I further assume that the Petrol Stations’ sales volumes will \nincrease in line with real GDP growth in Ukraine.  I note that Mr. Bezant’s valuation of the \nPetrol Stations incorporates the same assumption.45  As of October 2016, the International \nMonetary Fund projected the Ukrainian economy to grow, in real terms, by 2 .5 percent in 2017, \n3 percent in 2018, 3.5 percent in 2019, and 4 percent in 2020 and 2021.46  As a result, over the \ncourse of my 5- year explicit forecast period I project the Petrol Stations’ total fuel sales \nvolumes to increase from 339,750 tonnes in 2017 to 391,949 tonnes in 2021.47 \nFuel Prices  \n113. The second input on which the Petrol Stations’ revenues depend is the fuel sales price, which \nvaries depending on the fuel type.  I was provided with historical revenue figures for the Petrol \nStations for 2015 and the first half of 2016.  In combination with historical sales volume data, \nI was able to cal culate the average historical price for each fuel type across the Petrol Station \nnetwork.   \n114. I have constructed my DCF Model in US dollars.  It is logical to calculate the Fair Value of \nthe Petrol Stations in US dollars (before converting the Fair Value to UAH) because oil, and \nby extension oil product derivatives are priced in US dollars.  Therefore, I divided the historical \n \n42 Appendix D.7. \n43 UCE DCF Report, Table 4.2.2.  \n44 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, Appendix 8, ¶ A8.23.  \n45 Bezant Transferred Assets Report, Appendix 8, ¶ A8.25.  \n46 International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook, October 2016.

In my valuation of the Petrol Stations, I rely on the average realized prices from the first half \nof 2016, which range d from US$ 841.5/tonne for A -95 gasoline to US $ 485.5/tonne for LPG, \nto establish a baseline for fuel prices.  \n116. There are four primary factors that influence the retail price of petrol products. The  first and \nmost significant of these factors is the cost of crude oil.  According to the United States E nergy \nInformation Administration  (“EIA”), the cost of crude oil contributed to 56 percent  of the  retail \nprice for a gallon of regular grade gasoline between 2011 and 2020.49  The s econd factor is  \nrefining costs which are  dependent on the type of crude oil processed , the characteristics of the \npetrol that is produced, and the type  of processing technology used by the refinery.50  The third \nfactor affecting petrol product prices are distribution costs which include the cost to ship  the \npetrol from the refinery to storage tanks and from the storage tanks to individual petrol stations.  \nThe f ourth factor affecting pet"}

The price of crude oil and refining costs tend to be the most volatile of the four factors \ndescribed  above and thus cause most of the variation in retail petrol prices while the latter two \nfactors -  distribution costs and taxation  - tend to be relatively stable.51 \n118. In order to project petrol  prices across my  forecast period, I  relied on the forecasted future \nprice of crude oil as of my valuation date of 31 December  2016.

The most prominent of these is  Brent Crude, as it is estimated that 60  percent  of the \nworld’s traded oil is priced relative to  this benchmark.52 As such, Brent Crude is a worldwide \nbenchmark and therefore has a robust futures  market that I  can rely on for my analysis.  \n119. The best sources of the expected future price of crude oil as of 31 December  2016 can be \nfound in actual  futures contracts quoted by or entered into by market participants. Futures \ncontracts, which have been prevalent  in the commodities markets since the early 1980s, \nrepresent the collective expectation of all market  participants of the future prices of the traded \ncommodity.  \n120. As of 31 December 2016, the Brent futures curve was essentially flat, indicating that crude \noil prices were expected to remain stable at approximately US$ 58/barrel as shown in Figure \n2 below. \nFigure 2 – Brent Crude Spot and Futures, 2014 -202153 \n \n121.

However, as discussed above, other factors such as refining costs, transportation charges, \nand taxes, also impact the price of petrol .  Thus, while a US$ 1/tonne increase in the price of \nBrent crude can be expected to lead to a US$ 1/tonne increase in the price of petrol, the same \nis not true in percentage terms.  Mr. Bezant concludes that the appropriate pass -through rate is \n50 percent.55  I find this assumption to be consistent with the fact that crude oil accounted for \n56 percent of the cost of gasoline between 2011 and 2020, and thus implement the same \npercentage adjustment in my analysis.  Therefore, in order to project future petrol prices by grade, I indexed the futures price of crude oil to capture the change in crude oil since the first \nhalf of 2016, and then divided that change in half.  \nAdditional\n Revenue  \n123. The third component of the Petrol Stations’ revenue is sales of products and services other \nthan fuel.  These additional revenues include the following:  \n“[A]dditional  income is also generated related to the sale of related \ngoods and services, including the sale of oils, cigarettes, water, sales \nof stores, oil change services.”56 \n124. I gross up additional revenues from the first half of 2016 by a factor of 2.1, the same \nseasonality factor used to project full year 2016 fuel volumes.  I then assume that additional \nrevenues increase in line with the projected real growth of the Ukrainian economy throughout \nmy 5- year explicit forecast period.  These additional revenues accounte d for less than 1 percent \nof fuel revenues in 2015 and the first half of 2016.  Therefore, my valuation of the Petrol Stations is not sensitive to the assumptions regarding additional revenues.  \n125. Considering the assumptions outlined above regarding the Petrol Stations’ fuel sales \nvolumes, fuel prices, and additional revenues, I forecast the Petrol Stations’ total revenue to \n \n54 US Energy Information Administration, “What Drives US Gasoline Prices?” October 2014, p. 5.

The second component of my DCF M odel is the costs the Petrol Stations incur.  I considered \nthe fo llowing four costs in my analysis: 1) fuel procurement costs, 2) operating costs, 3) \ndepreciation, and 4) tax ation . \nFuel Procurement Costs  \n127. The most significant cost for any Petrol Station is the cost of fuel procurement.  The original \nvaluers assumed gross  margins on fuel sales ranging between 15 percent to  16 percent.59  In \nmy experience valuing petrol stations in Crimea, I have also assumed a gross margin on fuel \nsales of 15 percent.  Therefore, I consider this to be a reasonable assumption.  However, as \ndiscussed below, given the lack of original data available regarding the operating costs of the \nPetrol Stations, I have chosen to apply an operating margin, which removes the need to project a gross margin independently.

This is consistent with \nindustry wide figures and is consistent with the margins I have used in previous valuations of \npetrol stations in Crimea.  \n129. In Table 8 below, I compare the EBIT margins produced by the cost assumptions used by \nUCE with the 10 percent  EBIT margin I use in my valuation analysis.  I calculate two EBIT \nmargins using the UCE approach to cost forecasting.  The first margin includes a  royalty paid \nby the Petrol Stations in exchange for the right to use the branding of a larger network of \nstations.   UCE estimated this royalty payment to be 8.33 percent of gross profit.63  The second \nmargin  excludes the brand royalty payment which , as explained  in Section IV, I would not \nexpect the Petrol Stations to incur because I would ha ve expected the Bank to create a new, \nconsistent brand across the 246 Petrol Stations  following their transfer  to the Bank.  Moreover, \nI have not received any information which indicates the Petrol Stations ever paid any brand \nroyalty payments to the previous  enterprise owners o r to the First Defendant .  \nTable 8 – Comparison of Cost and Margin Calculations (2015 Revenues, UAH 000s)64 \n \n130.

Under the UCE approach, fuel procurement costs are assumed \nto be 85 percent of fuel revenues, and brand royalty payments are assumed to be 8.33 percent of gross profits. Of \nthe 246 Petrol Stations, 36 were not branded and thus would not pay a brand royalty. Therefore, this table slightly \noverstates royalty costs and understate s EBIT.

The third  category of costs is depreciation. As I discuss in more detail below, my forecast \nassumes that the  Petrol  Stations incur only maintenance capex  during the 5- year explicit \nforecast period.  In my DCF model, I assume the annual depreciation charge related to all fixed \nassets is equal to the incremental maintenance capital expenditures.  Because I use an EBIT \nmargin to project operating profit, the depreciation charge is not explicitly included in my forecast of the Petrol Station’s financial performance, but it is relevant to the calculation of \nfree cash flow.  \nTaxation  \n132. The fourth cost category is taxation .  Over the forecast period, I assume that the  Petrol \nStations pay corporate income tax at the statutory rate in Ukraine of 18 percent.65 \nCapital Expenditures  \n133. The third component of my DCF model is the Petrol Stations’ capital expenditures.  I am not \naware of any contemporaneous information regarding the historical or planned capital expenditures for the Petrol Stations.  \n134. Previously, when valuing networks of petrol stations in Crimea, I was provided with \nmanagement plans and budgets associated with renovations to those stations.  My valuation of \nthose s tations included an expected increase in sales volumes of 200 percent  or more  following \nthe completion of the renovations . The level of sales increases following renovation works was \nobserved at certain stations that had been renovated before the stations were expropriated by \nthe Russian Federation.  However, I have not been provided with any evidence to identify \nwhich of the 246 Petrol Stations could be renovated to improve sales.  As such, I am unable to \nincorporate in my valuation analysis  the incrementa l value a buyer and seller would attribute \nto a Petrol Station due to the significant potential growth associated with renovation.  Instead, my DCF M odel assumes that only maintenance capital expenditures  would be incurred at the \n \n65 Appendix D.2. \nD21/1/46\nPage 41 \n 246 Petrol Stations , i.e., those expenditures required to maintain the facilities in good working \ncondition. \n135. In order to estimate maintenance cap ital expenditures , I rely on the estimates contained in \nthe Baker Tilly report.  Baker Tilly indicated that the depreciation charge for a station is related \nto that station’s daily sales volume  as shown in Figure 3 below .   \nFigure 3 –Depreciation Charge per Station66 \n \n136. According to the historical sales volume data made available to me, the median sale s volume \nper station in 2015 was 1,476 tons.67 Assuming an average fuel density of 0.75 kg/liter, this \nequates to 3,033 liters/day, approximately equal to the dividing line between the smallest and \nsecond smallest categories of stations in in Figure 3 above.  Therefore, I assume that, as a \nbaseline, the Petrol Stations will incur maintenance cap ital expenditures  of UAH 236,000 per \nstation per year.  This equates to a maintenance capex to sales ratio of 0.8 percent, which is in \nline with maintenance capex ratios I observed when previously valuing Petrol Station networks \nin Crimea.68  Throughout my 5- year explicit forecast period, I assume that maintenance capex \nis equal to 0.8 percent of revenues.  \nWorking Capital  \n137.

The final component of my DCF model includes t he Petrol Stations’ change in net working \ncapital.  Net working capital is the difference between a company’s current assets and its \ncurrent  liabilities.  Net working capital is comprised of inventories, accounts receivable, and \naccounts  payable.  A change  in net working capital occurs when a company requires more (or \nless) cash to run  its business than it did in the previous period.

If net working capital decreases (for example, \ndue to the collection of a number  of sales made on credit), extra cash is available to distribute \nto the owners.  \n138. I have not been provided with historical financial statements for the Petrol Stations, and thus \nI cannot calculate historical balance sheet ratios for the various components of working capital.  \nThe UCE Report indicates the follow ing regarding the Petrol Stations’ working capital needs:  \n“Accounting for working capital is carried out by calculating the \ncost of stocks of petroleum products, with which a filling station must be provided for the smooth running of business. \nWorking capi tal is calculated as the value of a 7 -day supply of \npetroleum products. The required stock of petroleum products is \ncalculated based on the forecast of the cost of petroleum products, which was calculated as the difference between the forecasted gross income and the amount of marginal income.”\n69 \n139. Baker Tilly indicates that the Petrol Stations’ working capital needs were similarly limited:  \n“Through 100% prepayment of fuel, purchased and then sold through the filling station, the indicators of accounts receivable and payable are actually close to zero. In this case, the working capital consists only of the volume of fuel reserves at the filling station. Indicators of fuel reserves for the purpose of calculating the volume of working capital are taken equ al to 80% of the volume of the tank \nfarm of filling stations.”\n70 \n140. In my valuation, I adopt the assumption used in the UCE Report, and calculate net working \ncapital as one week’s cost of fuel, assuming fuel costs are 85 percent of retail prices (i.e., a 15 \npercent gross margin ). \nFree Cash Flow  \n141. Based on the revenue, cost, capital expenditure, and working capital assumptions described \nabove, my projection of the Petrol Stations free cash flow is shown in Figure 4 below.  \n \n69 UCE DCF Report, Section 4.5.  \n70 Baker Tilly PS Report, p. 63.  \nD21/1/48\nPage 43 \n Figure 4 – My Fr ee Cash Flow Projection, 2017- 202171 \n \n142.

Figure 4 shows that free cash flows are forecasted to increase steadily throughout the \nprojection period, from US$ 23.9 million in 2017 to US$ 28.8 million in 2021.  In order to \narrive at the Fair Value of the Petrol Stations using the Income  Approach, I discount these \nprojected free cash flows to my valuation date of 31 December 2016.  Since I am calculating the enterprise value of the Petrol Stations, the appropriate discount rate is the WACC.  In the \nfollowing subse ction, I discuss my calculation of the Petrol Stations’ WACC, including the \ncost of equity, cost of debt, and capital structure.  \nii. Discount Rate  \n143. The seco nd element of my valuation under the Income Approach is the discount rate used to \nreduce the nominal value of future cash f lows to a present value as of 31 December 2016.  I  \ndiscuss the components of my  WACC calculation in the following paragraphs. \nCost of Equity  \n144. The cost of equity reflects the rate of retu rn investors require in order to invest in the share \ncapital of a company. The most widely utilized method for estimating the cost of equity is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (“ CAPM ”).  The CAPM formula is shown in Figure 5 as follows:  \n \n71 Appendix D.1. 05101520253035\n2017 2018 2019 2020 2021US$ Millions\nD21/1/49\nPage 44 \n Figure 5 – CAPM Formula  \n \n145. The first component of the CAPM formula is the risk- free rate of return.  The risk -free rate \nis typically measured as the nominal yield on US government bonds (or other AAA -rated \nsovereign bonds).  I estimated the risk- free rate using the ten -year trailing average of the 20 -\nyear US Treasury bond yield as of 31 December 2016 of 3.45 percent.72   The use of an average \nyield over that period serves to eliminate the downward bias on government bond yields as of \n2015 created by unusual ly loose US monetary policy.  Well -regarded valuation practitioners \nhave identified the use of spot yields during periods of economic turmoil or significant monetary easing as a common valuation error.\n73   \n146. The second component of the CAPM formula is beta.  Beta measures the systematic risk, or \nvolatility, associated with a security relative to the market as a whole.  A beta of one indicates \nthat a security’s price will move with the market, while a beta greater than one indicates that a \nsecurity is more volatile than the market.  Alternatively, a beta of less than one indicates that a \nsecurity is less volatile than the overall market.  \n147. Since the Petrol Stations are not publicly traded, it is not possible to observe a beta directly.  \nA common solution to this issue is to use industry betas, calculated using data for companies \noperating in the same sector that are publicly traded, in order to determine a beta estimate for \nthe subject asset or company.  Professor Aswath Damodaran maintains a database of \ninformation on publicly traded firms organized by geography and industry.  Companies \nengaged in retail petrol operations are generally categorized in one of two industry \nclassifications: 1) Retail (Automotive) or 2) Oil/Gas Distribution.  I compute d an average \nunlevered beta for these two industry classifications of 0.83 as  shown in Table 9 below.  \n \n72 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “ US Treasury Yields. ” (BK-28) \n73 Grabowski, Roger J., “Mid -2011 Risk- Free Rate and ERP Update,” 28 July 2011.

Using the average unlevered beta of 0.83, I estimate a levered beta of 1.40 for the Petrol \nStations.75  To do this I assume an optimal target capital structure, calculated by averaging the \ndebt-to-equity ratios for the same two industries described above, and a tax rate equal to the \ncorporate in come tax rate in Ukraine. My calculation of the re- levered beta is shown in Table \n10 below. \nTable 10 – The Petrol Stations’  Levered Beta as of the Valuation Date76 \n   \n149. The third component of the CAPM formula is the equity risk premium. The equity risk \npremium represents the premium above the risk- free rate that investors require for taking the \nincreased risk associated with investments in equity securities rather than risk -free U.S. \nTreasuries.  I  considered equity risk pre miums recommended by Professor Damodaran, \nProfessors Dimson, Staunton & Marsh, Ibbotson/Morningstar, and a survey of academics and \npractitioners.  These sources suggest an  equity risk premium in the general range of 3.5 percent \n \n74 See Appendix D.6 .  \n75 The levered beta was calculated using the standard formula for re- levering beta: unlevered beta  x (1 + debt/equity \nx (1 – tax rate)).  \n76 See Appendix D.6 .

Finally, since the Petrol Stations are located in Ukraine rather than the United States, the \nincremental risks associated with operating and conduct ing commercial activities in Ukraine \nshould be taken into account. This incremental risk is referred to as country risk.  \n151. There are two ways country risk can be incorporated into the valuation analysis. First, the \ncost of equity can be increased by a count ry risk premium. Second, the underlying cash flows \nof the business or asset can be adjusted for country risk. These alternatives are also recognized \nby leading valuation authorities. \n“Generically, there are two ways of incorporating country risk; we \ncan ei ther adjust the cash flows or change the discount rate and we \nwill consider both approaches.”79 \n152. In my experience in the valuation of assets and companies in a wide range of industries and \ncountries, the decision to adjust the cash flows or add a country risk premium to the discount \nrate will usually turn on the nature of the commercial operations of the business or asset being \nvalued. Whichever method is chosen, the valuation practitioner should calculate the equivalent \neffect of the alternative option in order to assess the reasonableness of the outcome. For \nexample, if country risk is factored into the cash flows, the valuation practitioner should \ndetermine how much of a  country risk premium would need to be added to the discount rate to \n \n77 I considered a number of different sources of data for my  estimate of the Equity Risk Premium (ERP) as follows: \nProfessor Damodaran calculates a 5.88% arithmetic aver age ERP and a 4.20% geometric average ERP for the period \n1928 -2012 and a 3.91%  and 2.93 % ari"}

In the present case, I have chosen to in corporate country risk in the discount rate as a \npremium to the cost of equity.  When incorporating country risk into the discount rate, it is \nimportant to recognize that the spread between sovereign bonds issued by the host country and \nthat of the  United States (or other countries considered to have sovereign bonds that are risk-\nfree, such as  Germany or the U.K.) is often a poor surrogate for country risk. However, many \nvaluation practitioners use the sovereign bond spread as a proxy for the country risk premium \nwithout  considering the implications of doing so. \n“While many practitioners use the political risk premium, it is hard \nto find a clear description of what this premium really represents and \nthere is no strong theoretical foundation for its use. In f act, there are \ncertain limitations to the use of the political risk premium, including \nthe following: (1) sovereign bond spreads are good indicators of an investor’s (or market’s) required returns and expectations for certain \ngovernment bonds –  but they ar e susceptible to various market \nfluctuations, news, international capital flows, etc., that may or may \nnot be strongly correlated with the returns required by a European food company investing in a tomato plant in the stable Korean food \nmarket; and (2) the  likelihood that a government of a country will \nmee"}

A good example is Botswana and Japan,  which currently have the same ratings but may be \nperceived as having very different levels of risk associated with investing and operating a business in each country. Some adjustments that we propose later in this report address this issue.”\n80 \n154. In simple terms, the blanket application of sovereign bond spreads as a measure of country \nrisk is in direct contradiction to the widely accepted view that not all companies will have the \nsame exposure to country risk. For this reason, Professor Damodaran has introduced the \nconcept of “lambda,” which is an adjustment to the bond spread (like beta is an adjustment to \nthe equity risk premium) to account for the different levels of country risks faced by different  \n \n80 Salomon Smith Barney, “ A Practical Approach to the International Valuation & Capital Allocation Puzzle, ” 26 \nJuly 2002, p. 13.  (BK-16) \nD21/1/53\nPage 48 \n companies.81  While I agree with Professor Damodaran’s la mbda concept, my own experience \nindicates that starting with the sovereign bond spread as an initial measure of country risk for \na commercial activity is an artificial starting point. As such, typically I do not adopt \nDamodaran’s method of applying a lambda factor to a sovereign bond spread. I prefer instead \nto perform a more comprehensive analysis to identify the country risks faced by the business \nand quantify the impact these risks may have.  \n155. With respect to currency risk, the Petrol Stations have some , but not much, exposure .  While  \nrevenues and costs have historically been collected and paid in Ukrainian hryvnia , fuel is an \ninternational commodity priced in US dollars.  In the historical period of my DCF M odel, I \nconvert Ukrainian hryvnia to US Dollars on a yearly basis at each year’s average exchange \nrate. Furthermore, since I base forecasted cash flows on historical figures, all components of \nfuture free cash flows are also denominated in US Dollars. In m y projection period, I implicitly \nrely on the prevailing exchange rates in 2015 and 2016, which averaged approximately 21.9 \nand 26.2 hryvnia per US Dollar, respectively.82 The hryvnia depreciated significantly against \nthe US Dollar between 2013 and 2015, but the currency’s outlook was stable as of the fourth \nquarter of 2016, with an expected long term exchange rate of 28.5 UAH/USD.83   \n156. With respect to macroeconomic risk, the Petrol Stations are subject to some risk, as sales of \npetrol are correlated with th e overall health of the economy.  However,  Ukraine had favorable \nGDP forecasts as of the fourth quarter of 2016. Petrol prices are also highly correlated with \ncrude oil prices, which are based on worldwide supply and demand and are thus subject to \nglobal m arket fluctuations.  I note that p rice expectations for crude oil were stable as of 31 \nDecember 2016 .  Finally, as I have mentioned previously, Ukraine imports 80 to 85 percent of \nits fuel demand because there was only one operational refinery in Ukraine a t the time. \nUkraine’s reliance on imports does create an additional element of risk for all petrol stations \noperating in Ukraine.

With respect to social risks, I note that labor unions in Ukraine were considered to be weak \nin 2016.84  I have not reviewed any information that suggests that the Petrol Stations had a \nhistory of labor disruptions.  As such, I do not anticipate there to be any significant labor \ndisruptions during my projection period.  \n158. In light of the above, I have incorpor ated a country risk premium of 3 percent into the cost \nof equity for the Petrol Stations.  In order to assess the reasonableness of this country risk \npremium, I analyzed how the premium impacts the value of the Petrol Stations. By increasing the cost of eq uity by 3 percent  to account for country risk in Ukraine , I have decreased the \nvalue of  the Petrol Stations  by approxima tely 1 8 percent.  In other words, my  country risk \npremium assumes a buyer would pay 18 percent  less for the Petrol Stations because they are \nlocated in Ukraine rather than a developed economy with zero country risk.\n85 This impact on \nvalue is equivalent to assuming 66 days of lost revenue per year, every year throughout the \nprojection period.  Given the magnitude of the equivalent cash flow impact, I believe this \ncountry risk premium appropriately captures the level of incremental country risk faced by the \nPetrol Stations.  \n159. Based on the risk- free rate, equity risk premium, beta, and country risk premium outlined \nabove, I calculated a nominal cost of equity of 14.18 percent  as shown in Table 11 below.  \nTable 11 – Cost of Equity86 \n    \nCost of Debt  \n160. The cost of debt reflects the interest rate a company must pay to borrow money from a bank \nor the capital markets. As my discount rate and DCF M odels are constructed in US Dollars , I \n \n84 Freedom House, “Ukraine: Nations in Transit 2016, ” p. 13.

Specifically, I adopt the interest rate on new business loans to non- financial \ncorporations, as published by the NBU.  The average interest rate for this type of loan in 2016 \nwas 8.9 percent.87  After considering the Ukrainian  corporate income tax rate of 18 percent, \nthe Petrol Stations’  after -tax cost of debt is 7.32 percent .  \nCapital Structure and WACC  \n161. In order to compute the WACC, the cost of equity and after -tax cost of debt must each be \nassigned a weight determined by the Petrol Stations’ target capital structure. Capital structure \nrefers to the relative amounts of debt and equity a firm uses to finance its operations. In order \nto calculate the Fair  Value of  the Petrol Stations, I assumed a capital structure  based on the \naverage capital structure of the same two industries used to derive the beta: 1) the Oil/Gas \nDistribution sector and 2) the Retail (Automotive) sector.

Since the Petrol Stations ha d been generating positive operating cash flows historically and \nwould have been  expected to generate positive cash flows into the future, the Petrol Stations \nshould be treated as a going concern. Accordingly, the Income  Approach should consider cash \nflows projected beyond the explicit forecast period.  However, since it is not p ractical  to create \nannual cash flow projections over long periods of time , a different method must be utilized to \ncapture the value of the company beyond the forecast period (in this case, the forecast period \nends in 2021). A common approach for measuring the remaining value of cash flows into \nperpetuity is to implement a constant growth model to estimate the “terminal value”  or \n“continuing value”  of the company at the end of the forecast period. Under this method, the \ncash flow from the final year of the projection is adjusted by an expected long- term growth \nrate for the company and then “capitalized” by dividing the adjusted cash flow by the \ndifference between the WACC  and the same long- term growth rate.  The equation for the \nterminal value of a company based on the constant gr owth model is shown in Figure 6 below.  \nFigure 6 – Constant Growth Model for Calculating Terminal Value  \n \n163. Therefore, the inputs for this formula are the free cash flow in the last year of the projection, \nthe WACC, and the long- term growth rate.

The free cash flows I project for the Petrol Stations in 2021 are US$ 28.8 million.93  I assume \nthat the Petrol Stations’  cash flows will continue to grow at 2.34 percent, equal to expected \nlong term inflation in the United States . Using my  projected 2019 free cash flows, my  discount \nrate of 11.02 percent, and a long- term projected growth rate of 2.34 percent, I calculate th e \nundiscounted terminal value of the Petrol Stations  to be US$  338.8 million , shown in Table 13 \nbelow. \nTable 13 – The Petrol Stations’  Undiscounted Terminal Value ( US$)94 \n      \niv. Summary of My Fair Value Conclusion Under the Income Approach  \n165. After determining the free cash flow projections for the Petrol Stations, the discount rate, and \nthe terminal value, I have discounted my  cash flow projections to the Valuation Date of 31 \nDecember 2016  using the Petrol Stations’ WACC. My re sulting Fair Value conclusion for the  \n246 Petrol Stations on 31 December 2016 under the Income Approach  is US$ 313,674,625.95  \nThis enterprise value implies an EV/EBITDA multiple of 9.5x, based on the Petrol Stations’ \nprojected 2017 EBITDA of US$ 33.2 mill ion.96  According to Professor Damodaran, industry \naverage EV/EBITDA multiples for the Oil/Gas Distribution and Retail (Automotive) sectors were 10.5x and 10.7x, respectively, in 2016.\n97  My Fair Value conclusion under the Income \n \n92 See International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook, October 2016.

Furthermore, as discussed in detail in the following subsection , the per -station \nvalue implied by my consolidated DCF  Model is consistent with the per -station values \nobserved in concluded transactions both in Ukraine and elsewhere in Eastern Europe.   \n166. I convert my Fair Value conclusion from USD to UAH at the prevailing rate as of my 31 \nDecember 2016 valuation date of 27.2 UAH/USD.99  This results in a value conclusion for the \nPetrol Stations of UAH 8.528 billion, approximately 35 percent higher than the UAH 6.341 \nbillion Fair Value of the Petrol Stations originally rec orded on the Bank’s balance sheet.  My \ngrowth and margin assumptions are in fact more conservative than those used in the calculations made by the original valuers.  For example, as discussed earlier in this section, I \nassume that only half of the percenta ge increase in crude oil prices is passed through to retail \nfuel prices and assume a 10 percent EBIT margin, while UCE assumes the full percentage \nincrease in crude prices are passed through to retail fuel prices and an average EBIT margin of \napproximately 11.8 percent.

Finally, although I calculate the Fair Value of the Petrol Stations on a consolidated network \nbasis, I have also provided an estimate of the Fair Value of each individual asset by allocating \nmy overall value conclusion among the Petrol Stations in proportion to each asset’s relative \ncontribution to total EBITDA in the first half of 2016.  Based on this allocation, I estimate the \nFair Values of the individual Petrol Station assets to range from US$ 97,000 (UAH 2.6 million) \n \n98 Appendix D.1. \n99 Exchange Rates.org.uk, “ US Dollar (USD) to Ukraine Hryvnia (UAH) Historical Exchange Rates on 31st December \n2016.” (BK-39) \n100 UCE DCF Report, p. 73; Baker Tilly PS Report, p. 63.

Market Approach  \n168. I have also implemented the Market Approach to assess the Fair Value of the 246 Petrol \nStations.  I was not able to identify any l isted companies (or the necessary data for any listed \ncompanies) that were sufficiently comparable to the 246 Petrol Stations.  However, I was able \nto identify numerous transactions involving petrol stations and petrol station networks in \nEastern Europe, i ncluding Ukraine, that were comparable to the 246 Petrol Stations .  These \ntransactions have allowed me to robustly implement the Market Approach .  Table 14  below \nsummarizes the petrol station transactions that I identified and have analyzed for purposes of \ndetermining the Fair Value of the 246 Petrol Stations. \n \n101 Appendix D.9. \nD21/1/60\nPage 55 \n Table 14 – Comparable Petrol Station Network Transactions102 \n \n169. I provide the  following ten comments below  to explain how I have considered the data in \nTable 14 above to determine the Fair Value of the 246 Petrol Stations  under the Market \nApproach.  \n170. First, the  Fair Values  of the 246 Petrol Stations were originally measured and remeasured at \nyear 2016 at an enterprise level  (i.e., asset value) .  Likewise, Mr. Bezant has measured the \nvalue of the 246 Petrol Stations at an enterprise level.  I agree that enterprise value, rather than \n \n102 See Appendix E for further detail and references to  supporting documentation.

Howe ver, some of the transactions I have \nidentified relate to share value rather enterprise value.   Where possible, I have added long -term \ndebt to the share value to compute enterprise value.  Where long -term debt was not available, \nI am only able to rely upon share value which would, if long- term debt exists, understate the \nenterprise value.   In computing enterprise value, I have not subtracted cash on hand.  Many \nvaluation professionals add “net debt,” i.e., long- term debt less cash, to share value to compute  \nenterprise value.  I have not subtracted cash in computing enterprise value for the comparable \ntransactions because the cash balances at the 24 6 Petrol Stations w ere not available and not \nsubtracted by the valuers retained by the Bank (or Mr. Bezant).  As such, not subtracting cash \nto compute enterprise value for the comparable transactions yields a like -for-like computation \nof enterprise value.  Moreover, I typically do not subtract the entire cash balance of a company \nin computing enterprise value because all companies must maintain a cash balance as part of \nworking capital (i.e., “trapped cash”) . \n171. Second, Table 14 indicates that I identified 4 transactions that occurred before  2012.  I \nconsider these transactions to be too outdated to be useful in establishing the Fair Value of the \n246 Petrol Stations as of 31 December 2016.

Second, Table 14 indicates that I identified 4 transactions that occurred before  2012.  I \nconsider these transactions to be too outdated to be useful in establishing the Fair Value of the \n246 Petrol Stations as of 31 December 2016.  However, the transactions are still inf ormative.  \nIn particular, one transaction in 2010 relates to TNK -BP’s acquisition of 118 petrol stations \nand 8 OSFs in Ukraine.  The purchase price  was US$ 313 million or US$ 2.65 million per \nstation.   Another transaction relates to Hellenic Petroleum’ s acquisition of 17 newly \nconstructed Petrol Stations in Bulgaria.  These 17 stations were purchased for an average price \nof US$ 2.07 million .  This transaction provides a reasonable proxy for the cost of constructing \nnew petrol stations in Eastern Europe.   \n172. Third, I have identified 7 transactions that occurred after the 31 December 2016 valuation \ndate.  While I have not relied upon these transactions to determine the Fair Value of the 246 \nPetrol Stations as of 31 December 2016, the transactions provide an addi tional perspective on \nthe value of petrol station networks in Europe more recently. \n173. Fourth, I identified 17 transactions between 2012 and 2016 that I considered useful and \nrelevant in determin ing the Fair Value of the 246 Petrol Stations as of 31 December 2016 under \nthe Market Approach.  However, I was not able to identify the purchase price for 3 of the 17 \ntransactions.   As such, only 14 transactions were useful for my analysis.  \nD21/1/62\nPage 57 \n 174. Fifth, 8 of the 14  transactions involve NIS (Serbia) as the buyer of petrol st ations.  NIS \n(Serbia) is an energy company owned by Gazprom of Russia.  I have included 8 transactions \nconducted by NIS (Serbia) because this company was active in acquiring petrol stations and \nits financial statements provided very detailed financial info rmation pertaining to each \ntransaction.  \n175. Sixth, 5 of the 17 transactions relate to petrol station network sales by Lukoil, the largest \nprivate oil company in Russia.  I was not able to identify the transaction price for 2 of the 5 Lukoil sales.  Lukoil sold nearl y all of its petrol stations in Eastern Europe (including Ukraine) \nbeginning in late 2014 due to the negative sentiment that had developed in the region towards \nRussian companies following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in March 2014.\n103  Indeed, Lukoil \npublicly acknowledged that Eastern Europeans were boycotting Lukoil stations and causing those stations to generate losses.\n104  As such, the sale s of these Lukoil petrol stations would \nhave to be considered distressed or forced sales  such t hat the transaction price(s) would \nunderstate Fair Value.  \n176. Seventh, some of the transactions include OSFs, but most do not.  Unless the article or \nfinancial statements I have utilized to determine the average price of each petrol station \nacquired in the 14 transactions between 2012 and 2016 indicates OSFs were acquired with the \npetrol stations, I have assumed no OSFs were acquired. \n177. Eighth, there were two transactions involving petrol stations in U kraine in 2015 and  2016.  \nOn 30 April 2015, AMIC Energy (an Austrian investment fund) acquired 240 petrol stations \nfrom Lukoil for US$ 300 million or  an average price of US$ 1.25 million per station .  On 27 \nDecember 2016, Glusco Energy (as Swiss company) acquired 141 petrol stations from Rosneft, \nthe largest energy company in Russia that is owned and controlled by the state.  No doubt \nRosneft sold these petrol stations due to the negative sentiment in Ukraine towards Russian \ncompanies following the annexation of Crimea.  However, I was not able to identify the \ntransaction price for the Rosneft sale.  \n178. Ninth, in the 2 years prior to the valuation date of 31 December 2016, only 3 tran"}

However, I was not able to identify the \ntransaction price for the Rosneft sale.  \n178. Ninth, in the 2 years prior to the valuation date of 31 December 2016, only 3 transactions \nyielded an average value per petrol station less than US$ 1 million.   \n \n103 Media Reports on the Boycotts of Russian Owned Petrol S tations , 2014- 2016. (BK-40) \n104 Ibid. \nD21/1/63\nPage 58 \n 179. On 14 December 2014, Slovnaft acquired 96 petrol stations in Slovakia and Hungary from \nLukoil for US$ 713,474 per station.  The transaction price understates Fair Value because: 1) \nit reflects share value rather than enterprise value, and 2) the petrol stations were distressed \ndue to the negative Russian sentiment in Eastern Europe following the annexation of Crimea.    \n180. On 31 July 2015, Eni sold 208 petrol stations in Romania, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia \nto MOL at an average price of US$ 867,695.  MOL’s 2015 financial statements indicated that \nthe average after -tax profitability of these 208 stations was just 1.3 percent in 2015.  On 30 \nJune 2016, Eni sold 190 petrol stations in Slovenia and Hungary to MOL at an average price of US$ 585,114.  MOL ’s 2016 financial statements indicate that the average profitability of \nthese stations was negative  5 percent  in 2016.  Given the very low or negative profitability of \nthe petrol stations sold by Eni, it is not surprising the that average price per station appears as \nan outlier.  Interestingly, I note that MOL resold 41 and 144 of the petrol stations acquired \nfrom Eni in Slovakia and Hungary, respectively, to PKN Orlen on 12 January 2022 for an \naverage price of US$ 1.4 million.  As such, MOL must have substantially improved the \nprofitability of those stations after their acquisition from Eni.  \n181. Tenth, the weighted  average and simple  average prices  per petrol station  involved in the 14 \ntransactions between 2012 and 2016 w ere US$ 1.1 million and US$ 1.6 million, respectively.  \n182. In order to determine the Fair Value of the 246 Petrol Stations, I  have considered the \nweight ed average and simple  average range of US$ 1.1 million to US$ 1.6 million, \nrespectively, as well as the distressed price of US$ 1.25 million Lukoil obtained from AMIC \nfor the sale of 240 petrol stations in Ukraine in 2015 which needed to be rebranded.  Sin ce I \nconsider that the Bank ought to have rebranded the 246 Petrol Stations transferred to it, I \nbelieve an average Fair Value of US$ 1.25 million per station  is reasonable for the 246 Petrol \nStations.  As such, my Fair Value conclusion under the Market Approach for the 246 Petrol \nStations is US$ 307,500,000 or UAH 8,360,002,500 at the prevailing exchange rate of 27.2 \nUAH/USD as of 31 December 2016.\n105  My Fair Value conclusion under the Market Approach \nis approximately UAH 2  billion higher than the Fair Value originally determined by the Bank \nof UAH 6. 3 billion at year -end 2016.

The Valuation Technique that Maximizes the Use of Observable I nputs  \n183. While IFRS 13 states that the valuation technique that maximizes the use of observable inputs \nwill be the preferred valuation technique to measure Fair Value, it may be more difficult to \nascertain which valuation technique maximizes the use of observable inputs when those \ntechniques are both categorized at Level 3.  This is the situation I  confront with respect to my  \nimplementation of the Income and Market Approaches for the Petrol Stations. \n184. In this circumstance, IFRS 13 allows for a determination of Fair Value considering both \nvaluation techniques.  \n“In some cases a single valuation technique will be appropriate (eg \nwhen valuing an asset or a liability using quoted prices in an active \nmarket for identical assets or liabilities). In other cases, multiple \nvaluation techniques will be appropriate (eg that might be the case when valuing a cash- generating unit). If multiple valuation \ntechniques are used to measure fair value, the results (ie respective indications of fair value) shall be evaluated considering the reasonableness of the range of values indicated by those results. A fair value measurement is the point within that range that is most \nrepresentative of fair value in the circumstances.”\n106 \n185. More specifically, IFRS 13 allows for a possible weighting of  the value conclusion reached \nfrom multiple valuation techniques.  \n“Valuation techniques used to measure fair value shall be applied consistently.  However, a change in a valuation technique or its application (eg a change in its weighting when multiple val uation \ntechniques are used or a change in an adjustment applied to a valuation technique) is appropriate if the change results in a measurement that is equally or more representative of fair value in the circumstances.”\n107 \n186. The weighting of value conclusions  reached under multiple valuation techniques is a \ncommon method I have utilized to arrive at a final FMV conclusion when FMV is the \n \n106 EY, “Applying IFRS: IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement,” November 2012, p. 106.

The assignment of weights to multiple valuation techniques is a \nsubjective exercise that requ ires professional judgment.  This fact is recognized by leading \nauthorities on the valuation of closely held businesses. \n“As with the selection of which valuation methods to use, there are \nno scientific formulas or specific rules to use with regard to the \nweighting of the results of two or more valuation methods. \n[…] \nAn intuitively appealing method of concluding the value estimate is \nfor the analyst: (1) to use subjective but informed judgment and \ndecide on a percentage weight to assign to the indications of each \nmeaningful valuation approach or method and (2) to base the final \nvalue estimate on a weighted average of the indications of the \nvarious methods.”108 \n187. I consider that a weighting of the Income and Market Approaches I have implemented woul d \nbe appropriate in this case.  \n188. I typically weight a valuation technique based upon the quality of the data and information \navailable to implement that technique.  Fair Value would also require that I should determine \nweights by considering the amount of unobservable inputs utilized in each technique.  In the \npresent circumstance, I consider that both the Income and Market Approaches should be given \nequal weight.  \n189.

As such, I do not consider one technique to be superior to the other.  I believe Fair Value \ncould be properly determined via the Income or Market Approach alone or by weighting each \napproach.  I have decided to as sign a 50 percent weight to each approach .  Accordingly, my \nfinal Fair Value conclusion for the Petrol Stations is US$ 310,587,313 (UAH 8.444 billion) . \nD. Cross Check  \n192. As a cross check of my Fair Value conclus ion for the 246 Petrol Stations, I considered the \nvalues I assigned to 16 Ukrnafta and 31 Stabil et al . petrol stations in Crimea that were \nexpropriated by the Russian Federation in April 2014 following Russia’s annexation of the \npeninsula.  The compensation requested by claimants for these 47 petrol stations (and 2 OSFs \nowned by Stabil) w as the subject of international arbitration proceedings administered by the \nPermanent Court of Arbitration.   Table 15 below summarizes the amounts claimed  (which \ncorresponded to calculations I presented to the tribunal as the expert appointed by claimants) \nand the amounts awarded by the tribunal (who retained their own valuation expert to review \nmy valuation analysis). \n109 \n \n193. As Table 15 above reveals, the tribunal awarded an average of US$ 2.8 million for the 16 \nUkrnafta petrol stations and an average of US$ 1.1 million for the 31 Stabil petrol stations \n(plus 2 OSFs).

I believe th ese comparisons  further demonstrate the  \nreasonableness of the  values  I have  assigned to the 246 Petrol Stations.          \n My Determination of the Fair Value of the Oil Storage Facilities \n195. In this subsection, I briefly describe the assumptions I use to value the 72 Oil Storage \nFacilities (“OSFs”) that were transferred to the Bank under the Income Approa ch.  While my \nevaluation of the OSFs is significantly hampered by a lack of historical operating or financial data apart from that presented in the Baker Tilly OSF Report, in my view the Income Approach \nmakes the best use of what little contemporaneous dat a is available.  As discussed in Section \nVI, I assume that the OSFs were operational and providing storage services for the Petrol \nStations as well as other customers.  I discuss revenues, costs, capital expenditures, working \ncapital assumptions, overall f ree cash flow projections , the discount rate, and the terminal value  \nin turn. \nA. Revenues  \n196. The Storage Facilities’ revenue is fundamentally driven by three variables: 1) tonnes of fuel \nstored  and dispatched , 2) the wholesale price of petrol  products , and 3) the storage fee levied \non each tonne of fuel.   \n197. In my analysis,  I assume throughput volumes consistent with those provided to Baker Tilly \nwhen it was retained by the Bank to value the OSFs.  I was not provided with any historical financial and ope rating information for the OSFs apart from the Baker Tilly OSF Report, and \n \n110 Press Release and Swiss F ederal Court Judgments Related to the Crimea Arbitrations. (BK-41) \n111 Press Release and Swiss Federal Court Judgments Related to the Crimea Arbitrations. (BK-41) \nD21/1/68\nPage 63 \n I am not aware of any other volume data available as of my valuation date.  Therefore, despite \nthe fact that I have not reviewed the data underlying the throughput volumes provided to Baker \nTilly and have not been able to check their reasonableness, these volumes appear to be the only \nbasis available for estimating the OSFs’ throughput volumes as of 31 December 2016.  \n198. Baker Tilly was provided with records indicating that the 72 OSFs t hat were transferred to \nthe Bank had throughput of 1.89 million tonnes of fuel for a period covering 11 months of \n2015.112 I gross this figure up to a full -year throughput volume of 2.06 million tonnes.113  \nThroughout the course of my forecast period, throughput volumes increase along with real growth in the Ukrainian economy.  Throughout my projection, I assume that the mix of fuels \nstored by the OSFs (i.e., A -92, A -95, diesel, and LPG) is the same as the mis of fuels sold by \nthe Petrol Stations.  \n199. In my analysis, I adopt the same methodology to project  petrol prices that I  used for the Petrol \nStations.  I assume that wholesale petrol prices are equal to 85 percent of the retail prices used \nto project the rev enues of the Petrol Stations, consistent with the 15 percent gross margin \napplied in the UCE DCF Report.\n114 \n200.

I assume that the Storage Facilities continue to charge a storage fee equal to 1.5 percent  of \nthe wholesale price of petrol.   This storage fee is in line with those charged by oil storage \nfacilities in Crimea that I have valued previously.115  Revenues are then calculated by \nmultiplying throughput volumes of each fuel type first by the corresponding wholesale fuel price, and then by the 1.5 percent stor age fee.  \nB. Costs  \n201. I include three cost items in my projection of the OSF’s cash flows: 1) operating costs, 2) \ndepreciation, and 3) taxes.  I was not provided with any operating cost data associated with the \n72 OSFs that were transferred to the Bank.  Therefor e, based on my experience valuing oil \nstorage facilities in Crimea, I assume that operating costs are equal to 49 percent of storage \nrevenues.

Therefore, I assume that capital expenditures are limited to maintenance \ncapex, and that depreciation matches maintenance capex.  Finally, I assume that the OSFs pay \nincome tax at the statutory rate in Ukraine of 18 percent.  \nC. Capital Expenditures  \n202. As discussed in the previous subsection, in the absence of any information regarding the \nplanned investments in the OSFs, I assume that capital expenditures are limited to maintenance capital expenditures .  Based on my experience valuing oil storage facilities in Crimea, I assume \nthat maintenance cap ital expenditures  are equal to 8 percent of annual storage revenues.\n116  \nD. Working Capital  \n203. With regard to the OSF’s working capital needs, Barker Tilly indicates the following:  \n“Through 100% prepayment of fuel, it is purchased and then sold \nthrough the petroleum tank farm, the indicators of accounts \nreceivable and payable are actually close to zero .”117 \n204. Therefore, my DCF model does not consider working capital changes in the projection of the \nOSF’s free cash flows.  \nE. Free Cash Flow  \n205. Based on the above forecasts, I determined the OSF’s free cash flows for 2017 through 2021. \nI show these cash flow projections in Figure 7 below.  \n \n116 This corresponds to the median hi storical capex/storage revenue ratio for two oil storage facilities owned by Stabil \net al.

In doing so, I maintained the same \nassumptions present in my calculation of the Petrol Stations’ WACC regarding the risk -free \nrate, the equity risk premium, the country risk premium, and the cost of debt.  The only differences between the WACC calculations for the Petrol Stations and the OSFs are the beta \nand the assumed capital structure.

Summary of My Fair Value Conclusion for the OSFs  \n208. After determining the free cash flow projections for the OSFs , the discount rate,  and the \nterminal value, I have discounted my cash flow projections to the Valuation Date of 31 \nDecember 2016  using the OSFs’  WACC. My resulting Fair Value conclusion for the  OSFs  on \n31 December 2016 under the Income Approach is US$ 87,189,028.121  This enterprise value \nimplies an EV/EBITDA multiple o f 8.1x, based on the OSFs’ projected 2017 EBITDA of US$ \n10.8 million.122  According to Professor Damodaran, industry average EV/EBITDA multiples \nfor the Oil/Gas Distribution was 10.5x in 2016.123  My Fair Value conclusion also implies an \naverage value per -OSF value of US$ 1,210,959.124  This per -facility value is consistent with \nthe range I previously calculated when valuing storage facilities in Crimea at approximately \nUS$ 1.17 million per facility.  As a final reasonableness check, I note that Baker Till y used the \ncomparable transaction approach to value two assets for which no throughput data was provided.  Baker Tilly determined that buyers of comparable assets could be expected to pay \nUS$ 136 per tonne of storage tank capacity.\n125  The 72 OSFs that were  transferred to the Bank \nhad a total tank capacity of 522,775 tonnes.126  Therefore, Baker Tilly’s comparable transaction \nanalysis implies a value of US$ 71.1 million for the OSFs, which is within 18 percent of the \nFair V alue conclusion I reached using the Income A pproach.  \n209. I convert my Fair Value conclusion from USD to UAH at the prevailing rate of 27.2 \nUAH/USD as of my 31 December 2016 valuation date.127  This results in a value conclusion \nfor the OSFs of UAH 2.370 billion, approximately 58 percent lower than the UAH 5.685 \nbillion Fair Value of the OSFs originally recorded o"}

See the Baker \nTilly OSF Report, p. 35, Tables 9 and 10. If I were to adopt Baker Tilly’s assumption regarding the gross margin of \nthe OSFs, my valuation of the OSFs would increase to over UAH 6 billion.  \nD21/1/73\nPage 68 \n that is in line with the 52 percent downward adjustment made in the EY Report.129  Similarly, \nafter reviewing values of 36 OS Fs with a combined initial recognition value UAH 2.249 \nbillion, the NBU determined a “validated” value for these 36 assets of UAH 1.314 billion, a \nreduction of 42 percent.130 \n210. Finally, although I calculate the Fair Value of the OSFs on a consolidated network basis, I \nhave also provided an estimated of the Fair Value of each individual asset by allocating my \noverall Fair V alue conclusion among the OSFs in proportion to each OSF’s capacity.  Based \non this allocation, I estimate the Fair Values of the individual  OSF assets to range from US$ \n48,367 (UAH 1.3 million) to US$ 3.7 million (UAH 100.1 million), with a median value of \nUS$ 1.1 million (UAH 30.7 million).131 \n Expert Declaration  \n211.
