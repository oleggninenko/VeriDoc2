MY QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE \n I am a Partner and Head of the International Litigation Department at Eterna Law, Kyiv office. \nI specialise in international commercial arbitration and litigation, commercial and civil \nlitigation, white-collar crime, corporate law, and foreign investment. I have substantial \nexperience in resolving corporate and post-M&A disputes before LCIA and ICC arbitral \ntribunals as well as national courts of different jurisdictions. \n I graduated from Lviv National University School of Law (Ukraine) in 2001 with the \nqualification of Jurist. During my period of studies in Ukraine, I worked as assistant to the \nChair of the Ukrainian Parliamentary Committee on Legal Policy (2000-2001). My \nresponsibilities included legal analysis and preparation of draft legislation, as well as certain \nmatters relating to organisation of the Committee’s work. \n In 2003, I received a scholarship from the US State Department to study for an LL.M. degree \nat the Washington College of Law (American University), which I completed in 2004. During \nthe period of my law studies in the United States, I also interned for the law firm Alston & \nBird in New York. \n From 2005-2009, I worked as an associate for Magisters, a major Ukrainian law firm, in its \ndispute resolution practice. \n In 2009, after I joined Astapov Lawyers ILG, I decided to expand my law practice by \nqualifying as an advocate, and was admitted to the Bar of Ukraine. Since then I have carried \nout my practice at Astapov Lawyers ILG, where I became a partner in 2012. \n In May 2016, Astapov Lawyers ILG announced a merger with Baltic Business Group, a \nEuropean full-service law firm with offices in Germany and Latvia. The companies signed a \nstrategic partnership agreement to operate together under a common brand Eterna Law. \n In 2015 and 2016 in the Ukrainian Journal of Business Law’s annual reports Ukrainian Law \nFirms: Handbook for Foreign Clients, I was named among the leading individuals in Ukraine \nin the area of International Arbitration and named among notable practitioners in Litigation. \nI was recognised as a leading individual in Dispute Resolution (Tier-1) by Legal 500 EMEA \nin 2019, 2020 and 2021, and was recommended from 2015 to 2018. \nC1/1/3\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 4 -  I have been instructed as a party-appointed expert on issues of Ukrainian law and have \ngiven expert reports pursuant to Part 35 of the English Civil Procedure Rules (“ CPR ”), in the \nfollowing English High Court cases: (i) Merchant International Corporation Co. Ltd v. \nNaftogaz ; (ii) Pinchuk v. Kolomoisky and Bogolyubov ; (iii) JSC BTA Bank v. Vanguard \nCapital Partners Limited ; (iv) Avonwick Holdings Limited v.

Azitio Holdings Limited, Dargamo \nHoldings Limited, Oleg Mkrtchan and Sergiy Taruta . In the last of these cases, I appeared \nin the High Court to give evidence and was cross-examined over parts of three days.  \n I have also been instructed as a party-appointed expert on issues of Ukrainian law and have \ngiven expert reports in the following Cypriot and US cases: (i) JSC “State Export-Import \nBank of Ukraine” v. Rabiturna Limited , before the District Court of Nicosia, Cyprus; (ii) JSC \nPrivatBank v. Kolomoisky, Bogolyubov , Novikov and others  before the District Court of \nLimassol, Cyprus; and (iii) JSC PrivatBank v. Kolomoisky, Bogolyubov, Korf and others , \nbefore the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware.\n I have also given expert evidence on issues of Ukrainian law in the following arbitration \nproceedings: (i) a multi-million dollar dispute heard under the Swiss Rules of International \nArbitration before the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Geneva; and (ii) a multi-million \ndollar dispute heard before and under the rules of the London Court of International \nArbitration.  \n I have given seven expert reports previously in these proceedings in relation to interlocutory \nmatters: my first report of 15 December 2017; my second report of 18 December 2017; my \nthird report of 23 March 2018; my fourth report of 24 April 2018; my fifth report of 6 July \n2018; my sixth report of 1 September 2020; and my seventh report of 23 November 2020. I \nhave been instructed that where one of the questions I am instructed to address in this report \nhas been addressed by me in one or more of my previous reports, I should not incorporate \nmy previous opinion in this report by way of cross-reference, but should instead set out my \ncurrent opinion in full in this report, in order that my evidence for trial is up-to-date and \ncontained in this single document. \n A copy of my curriculum vitae is attached at Appendix I. \n Ukrainian is my native tongue, but I am fluent in English and intend to give evidence at trial \nin English. \nC1/1/4\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 5 - B. MY INSTRUCTIONS \n I have been instructed by Hogan Lovells International LLP (“ Hogan Lovells ”) on behalf of \nthe Claimant, Joint Stock Company Commercial Bank “PrivatBank” (the “ Bank ”) to provide \nan expert report for the purposes of the trial of these proceedings setting out my opinion on \nthe questions of Ukrainian law that have been presented to me by Hogan Lovells. These \nquestions are set out below (in bold) in sections D to O, with each section setting out \nquestions in relation to a different subject, as shown in the table of contents above. In section \nC, I first give a brief overview of the Ukrainian legal system and explain the authoritativeness \nof the various sources of law within it.  \n For the purposes of preparing this report, Hogan Lovells have provided me with the \ndocuments listed at Appendix II. \nC. THE UKRAINIAN LEGAL SYSTEM \n The Ukrainian system of law belongs to the continental civil law (Romano-Germanic) \ntradition that Ukraine inherited from the former Soviet Union, which recognises a codified \nsystem of legislation as the primary source of law, together with certain additional sources \nas set out below. \n Legislation. Legislation is the primary source of law. There is a four-tier hierarchy to \nlegislation:  \n The Constitution of Ukraine is the highest source of law.  \n National laws adopted by the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s Parliament, are second in the \nhierarchy and comprise both Codes (such as the Civil Code, Commercial Code etc.) \nand "}

Legislation is the primary source of law. There is a four-tier hierarchy to \nlegislation:  \n The Constitution of Ukraine is the highest source of law.  \n National laws adopted by the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s Parliament, are second in the \nhierarchy and comprise both Codes (such as the Civil Code, Commercial Code etc.) \nand separate Laws which are formally of the same force. Codes establish the general \nframework of the legislation in particular areas, while Laws regulate more specific \nsituations. The Civil Code is regarded as the main source of civil law which regulates \nproperty and non-property civil law relationships.  \n The third tier comprises local laws adopted by regional legislative bodies.  \n Lastly, national, regional, and local executive officials and bodies may issue executive \norders in areas of their own competence (as defined in the Constitution). \nC1/1/5\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 6 -  Where there is conflict between legislation enacted at different levels of this hierarchy, the \nlegislation enacted at the higher level will prevail.  \n Regulatory orders. Where a government regulatory body is authorised by law to issue \ndecisions or regulations, they will be of legal effect and binding upon those entities or \nindividuals that are subject to regulation by that body. Decisions and regulations of the \nNational Bank of Ukraine (the “ NBU ”), for example, are binding upon Ukrainian banks. \n International law. Ukraine adopts a monist approach to international law. This means that \nonce an international treaty is ratified by the Ukrainian government it does not need to be \nimplemented domestically to have effect; instead it will have direct effect as a result of Article \n9 of the Constitution of Ukraine. This includes the European Convention for the Protection \nof Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“ ECHR ”). Judgments of the European Court \nof Human Rights are cited as a source of law in judicial practice. \n Court system. Under the Law of Ukraine on the Court System and the Status of Judges, the \nUkrainian judicial system is divided into three different branches, namely: \n the courts of general jurisdiction (also known as the ‘civil courts’); \n the commercial courts (previously known as the ‘arbitration courts’); and \n the administrative courts.  \n Each branch of the court system has its own distinct jurisdiction and its own local (first \ninstance) courts and Courts of Appeal, which conduct full reviews of fact and law. The \nSupreme Court is the highest court in the judicial system. \n There is a clear demarcation between the branches. Commercial courts hear claims solely \nbetween legal entities and/or individual entrepreneurs, save that private individuals may \nappear as parties in the commercial court in the circumstances described in Article 20 the \nCode of Commercial Procedure1. The administrative courts primarily hear claims involving \ndisputes between or claims against State bodies and officials. The ‘civil courts’ (i.e. courts \n1  Namely, disputes between shareholders, disputes where an individual is sued in their capacity as an officer \nof a company or as an entrepreneur or self-employed person, and disputes where an individual is sued as \na surety to an agreement entered into by a legal entity. \nC1/1/6\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 7 - of general jurisdiction) hear all other cases, both criminal and non-criminal, which include \nthe great majority of cases where one of the parties is an individual.  \n There are also two Higher Specialised Courts within Ukraine’s judicial system which operate \nboth as courts of first instance and as appellate courts for the consideration of particular \ncategories of cases.

The High Intellectual Property Court hears cases involving the \nprotection of intellectual property rights, and the High Anti-Corruption Court hears criminal \ncases where certain categories of public officials are involved.  \n Judicial authority. Certain types of judicial acts are regarded as a source of law in the \nUkrainian legal system: \n First, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine may issue binding interpretations of the law \nand strike down legislation that it finds incompatible with the Constitution.  \n Second, the Supreme Court, which on 15 December 2017 was constituted as a new \ncourt pursuant to wide-ranging judicial reforms, and which is now Ukraine’s only court \nof cassation (to which appeals can be taken that do not involve any review of facts), is \nempowered to issue guidance on court practice to the lower courts. By law, the lower \ncourts must take into account judgments issued by the Supreme Court as to how the \nlaw is to be applied2. The Supreme Court consists of: \n four chambers, being the Civil Cassation Court, Commercial Cassation Court, \nAdministrative Cassation Court and Criminal Cassation Court, each of which hears \ncassation appeals arising from cases of one of the following four types: criminal, \ncommercial, administrative and civil; and \n a Grand Chamber, the main task of which is to ensure uniformity of practice \nbetween the Supreme Court’s other four chambers. As a matter of practice, \njudgments issued by the Grand Chamber carry greater weight than judgments \nissued by the other chambers. \n2  Article 13 of the Law of Ukraine “On the judiciary and the status of judges” provides: “ 6. The conclusions \non the application of the rules of law, set out in the resolutions of the Supreme Court, are taken into account \nby other courts when applying such rules of law” ; and Article 263(4) of the Civil Procedural Code provides: \n“4. When choosing and applying the rule of law to controversial legal relations, the court takes into account \nthe conclusions on the application of the relevant rules of law set forth in the resolutions of the Supreme \nCourt ”. See also Article 236(4) of the Commercial Procedural Code and Article 242(5) of the Code of \nAdministrative Procedure. \nC1/1/7\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 8 -  Where court practice on the application of particular law is not settled, reference can be \nmade to prior judgments and rulings. Those of the Supreme Court are typically given the \ngreatest weight and are regarded as having persuasive authority, followed by judgments of \nthe Courts of Appeal (and particularly the Court of Appeal governing the region where the \ncase is being heard), although there is no formal rule in this regard. Judgments and rulings \nof local (first instance) courts are of more limited value, but can give an indication of the \ncourts’ approach to a particular issue where there is no published practice of the higher \ncourts on the point. For the avoidance of doubt, there is no system of binding judicial \nprecedent in Ukraine as I understand to be the case in common law jurisdictions. \n Before 15 December 2017, the Supreme Court of Ukraine (as it was then known) and the \nHigh Courts, which were also courts of cassation present in each branch of the court system, \nwere empowered to issue guidance on court practice to the lower courts.

Nevertheless, the practice of these former courts (including \nthe guidance they issued) is still relied upon today, provided that it does not conflict with the \npractice of the new Supreme Court. \n Academic writings. Academic writings are not a source of law and are rarely, if ever, cited in \nUkrainian court filings or judgments. They are helpful, however, to arrive at a purposive \ninterpretation of the law by explaining the legal theory underlying a particular statutory \nprovision and how it fits into the overall system of law, or by simply demonstrating how \ncurrent legal thought perceives the issue.  \n In this section D through section O below, I set out my opinion on each of the questions that \nHogan Lovells has presented to me. Each question is set out in bold and numbered uniquely. \nUnless otherwise indicated, where I refer in this report to a provision of Ukrainian legislation \nI refer to the current version. \nC1/1/8\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 9 - D. VOID AND VOIDABLE TRANSACTIONS \nD1. Under Ukrainian law, what is the difference between a transaction that is void and a \ntransaction that is voidable? \n The general requirements for a transaction to be valid under Ukrainian law are set down at \nArticle 203 of the Civil Code, which provides:\n“1. The content of a transaction may not be in conflict with this Code or other civil statutes \nor state or public interests or public morals. \n2. A party to a transaction must have the necessary civil capacity. \n3. The expression of will by a party to a transaction must be free and correspond to his inner \nwill. \n4. A transaction must be executed in a form prescribed by law. \n5. A transaction must be aimed at causing the legal effect contemplated thereby. \n6. A transaction executed by parents (whether blood or adoptive) may not conflict with the \nrights and interests of their minor, underage or incapable children”. \n The Civil Code then defines various circumstances in which a transaction will be deemed to \nbe void, as well as various circumstances which merely render a transaction voidable. \n Void transactions. Where the law prescribes that a transaction is invalid on particular \ngrounds (a ‘void transaction’), the transaction is deemed invalid ab initio as a matter of law. \nNo special action needs to be brought to set the transaction aside and no order declaring \nthe transaction void is required (Articles 215(2), 236(1) of the Civil Code). A void transaction \nwill have only the legal consequences associated with its invalidity, such as restitution of \nproperty passing under that transaction pursuant to Article 216(1) of the Civil Code, and \nliability in damages pursuant to Article 216(2) of the Civil Code. A claimant may bring a claim \nseeking to apply the consequences of the transaction’s invalidity, or the court may apply \nthose consequences of its own motion. Such a claim may be brought by any interested party, \nincluding a person who was not a party to the transaction (Article 216(5) of the Civil Code). \n Voidable transactions. Where the law states that a transaction may be declared invalid by \nthe court on certain grounds (a ‘voidable transaction’), the transaction is presumed to be \nlawful and valid unless and until it is declared invalid by the court (Article 204 of the Civil \nC1/1/9\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 10 - Code). This presumption of validity only applies to voidable, as opposed to void, \ntransaction"}

Where the law states that a transaction may be declared invalid by \nthe court on certain grounds (a ‘voidable transaction’), the transaction is presumed to be \nlawful and valid unless and until it is declared invalid by the court (Article 204 of the Civil \nC1/1/9\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 10 - Code). This presumption of validity only applies to voidable, as opposed to void, \ntransactions. \n If a voidable transaction is declared invalid by the court, it is invalid ab initio  and not from the \nmoment of the court’s declaration (Article 236(1) of the Civil Code). Again, a claim seeking \nto apply the consequences of the transaction’s invalidity may be brought by any interested \nparty, including a person who was not a party to the transaction (Article 215(3) of the Civil \nCode). \nD2. When is a transaction contrary to public order under Article 228 of the Ukrainian Civil \nCode (“Article 228”), and what is the consequence?  \n Transactions that are contrary to public order3 under Article 228 are void and of no legal \neffect.  \n As regards the determination of whether a transaction is contrary to public order, the \nSupreme Court has stated in case No. 911/2574/18, JSC Chornomornaftogaz v. \nUkratomenergo LLC4: \n“The legislature provides no specific list of transactions that are contrary to the public order, \nbut only highlights the general features of the legal relations that are likely to constitute their \ncontent and for which the existence of public and/or state interest therein is critical. The \nscope and substance of the “public order” concept should be understood in a broad sense \nthat is characterised by variability, which is due to the continuous evolvement of social \nrelations and the discretionary nature of their legal regulation. It is impossible and \ninadvisable to narrow the definition of this concept to certain strict limits. \nThe public order concept only highlights the general features of the legal relations that are \nlikely to constitute their content and for which the existence of state and/or public interest \ntherein is critical. The interests of the public and the state are not precisely formed and they \nare modified or transformed, depending on changes in social relations themselves, as well \nas the forms of initiating, changing or terminating them which are produced by parties to \nthose relations and the state  \nThe concept of “public order” therefore embraces substance only when it is applied. Further, \nthose who apply law understand and apprehend this concept differently. Therefore, the \nquestion of whether legally significant acts are consistent with the public order must be \ndecided by a court on a case by case basis”.\n3  Contrary to ‘public order’ is the literal translation of Article 228, but in Ukrainian legal communities Article \n228 is often referred to and understood as applying to transactions that are contrary to public policy. \n4  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 7 October 2020, case No. 911/2574/18, JSC Chornomornaftogaz \nv. Ukratomenergo LLC .\nC1/1/10\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 11 -  There is no requirement that a transaction under consideration involve the state or other \npublic entity, or threaten the social and economic foundations of the state, in order to be \ncontrary to public order. As the Supreme Court has indicated above, the requirement is \nsimply that there exist a public or state interest in the transaction, and as the cases I discuss \nbelow demonstrate, a sufficient public or state interest will arise when the transaction \ninvolves an infringement on property rights protected under the Constitution of Ukraine. In \nparticular, Article 41 of the Constitution of Ukraine (as well as Article 1 of the first Protocol \nto the ECHR) recognises and protects the right of everyone to peaceful enjoyment of \nproperty rights (including any “ legitimate expec"}

In \nparticular, Article 41 of the Constitution of Ukraine (as well as Article 1 of the first Protocol \nto the ECHR) recognises and protects the right of everyone to peaceful enjoyment of \nproperty rights (including any “ legitimate expectation ” to acquire property), and as the \npeaceful enjoyment of property rights is a matter in which the public and state have an \ninterest, under Article 228 a transaction (or a series of transactions) may be found to breach \npublic order if inter alia  it is directed at destroying or unlawfully misappropriating the property \nof another, or violating their constitutional rights. In my view, transactions directed at \nconcealing the destruction or unlawful misappropriation of property equally fall foul of this \nprohibition.  \n Ukrainian courts have applied Article 228 to invalidate transactions between private persons \ninvolving the violation of a person’s property rights. For example, in the High Commercial \nCourt case of Petrivna LLC v. Gidromash Ltd LLC et al5, the claimant sought to evict the \ndefendants from the claimant’s property. In their defence, the defendants invoked certain \nlease agreements granted to the defendants by a party that, many years before, had \nregistered the property in its name pursuant to a court decision that was later cancelled. The \nclaimant argued that the lease agreements were void pursuant to Article 228 as being \ncontrary to public order, since the true owner of the property (the claimant) had not \nconsented to them and they violated the claimant’s private property rights. The High \nCommercial Court confirmed the applicability of Article 228 in these circumstances, stating \nthat: \n“In resolving the dispute, contrary to the requirements of Article 4 of the Commercial \nProcedural Code of Ukraine, the commercial courts failed to assess the lease agreement of \n1 January 2013 No. A-1 in light of Article 228 of the Civil Code of Ukraine as a type of civil \nlaw agreement belonging to a group of contracts related to property and its use (subject \nmatter, object, parties, content), since this rule of law definitely applies to private property: a \ntransaction is considered to be one that violates public order if it was aimed at violating \nconstitutional rights and freedoms of man and citizen, destruction, damage to property of a \n5  Resolution of the High Commercial Court dated 26 September 2017, No. 915/1997/15,  Petrivna LLC v. \nGidromash Ltd LLC et al .  \nC1/1/11\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 12 - physical or legal person … [or] the illegal seizure of them, and so a transaction that violates \npublic order is null and void. \nWhen a claimant alleges a transaction is null and void to substantiate another claim, the \ncourt is not entitled to refer to the lack of a court decision establishing the invalidity of the \ntransaction, and must assess the claimant’s arguments, yet the commercial courts did not \ngive a proper legal assessment of the grounds on which defendants occupy the claimant’s \npremises and did not apply the rules of substantive law applicable to the lease agreements”.  \n(I should make clear that throughout this report, all underlined emphasis appearing in \ntranslated quotations, such as the above, has been added by me and, unless otherwise \nstated, does not appear in the original source). \n The Supreme Court’s Resolution dated 27 November 2019 in case No. 0907/17918/2012, \nZoloti Vorota Bank PJSC v.

There, a loan agreement that was part of a fraudulent \nscheme to extract funds from a bank for the benefit of the bank’s former employees was \nfound to contravene Article 228:  \n“In view of the foregoing, loan agreement No. 02/355, dated 7 May 2008, and made between \nZoloti Vorota Bank (a commercial bank and a joint-stock company) and PERSON_2 is void \nas it is contrary to the public order, given that it was aimed at misappropriating the bank’s \nfunds”. \n In the Zakarpattia Region Appellate Court case, Person 2 v. Bank Forum PJSC et al ,6 a \nclaimant stood to inherit real property from her deceased mother. Before the mother’s death, \nand without her knowledge, a third person had forged a certificate of title to the property in \ntheir name in order to take out a loan against the property. The appellate court held that the \nmortgage contract with the bank was void under Article 228 as it had the unlawful purpose \nof usurping the mother’s property rights. This is a further example of a transaction between \nprivate persons being found to be contrary to public order.  \n6  Decision of the Zakarpattia Region Appellate Court dated 4 February 2015, No. 301/2539/14-ts, Person 2 \nv. Bank Forum PJSC et al .  \nC1/1/12\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 13 - D3. When is a transaction a sham (or mock or deceptive) transaction under Article 235 of \nthe Ukrainian Civil Code (“Article 235”), and what is the consequence? \n Under Article 235 of the Civil Code, a sham transaction is a transaction entered into by the \nparties with the aim of concealing or disguising another transaction: \n“Article 235. Legal consequences of a sham transaction \n1. A transaction shall be sham if it has been concluded by the parties for the purposes of \nconcealing another transaction, which they actually concluded. \n2. In case it is established that the transaction has been concluded by the parties to conceal \nanother transaction, which they actually concluded, the relations between the parties shall \nbe governed by the rules applicable to such actual transaction”.\n Although Article 235 does not expressly state that a sham transaction is ‘void’, as a matter \nof substance this is its consequence. Article 235(2) provides that where a transaction has \nbeen entered into in order to conceal another transaction which the parties have actually \nconcluded, “the relations of the parties shall be regulated by rules with regard to the \ntransaction which the parties actually concluded” . In other words, Article 235 makes clear \nthat the transaction which the parties pretended that they were entering into has no legal \neffect.  \n The Plenary High Commercial Court held as follows in its Resolution No. 11 dated 29 May \n2013: \n“Having found during the examination of a case that a particular transaction was entered \ninto with the aim of concealing another transaction (a sham transaction), the court on the \nbasis of Article 235(2) of the Civil Code of Ukraine shall proceed on the basis that the parties \nentered into the transaction that they had in mind, and examine the substance of the case \napplying the laws regulating the latter transaction. If that [transaction] is contrary to law, the \ncourt must decide to declare it invalid and apply, as necessary, the relevant legal \nconsequences”. \n In case No. 910/10222/19, the parties concluded a residential lease agreement, but the \nSupreme Court in its Resolution of 20 October 2021 concluded that it was a sham:\n“The Supreme Court has repeatedly noted that under a sham transaction, the parties \ndeliberately conclude one transaction, but in fact, other legal relations are being established \nbetween them."}

In such a situation, there are two transactions: one is sham, and another - is \nthe one that the parties had really in mind. Consequently, a sham transaction with its form \ncovers the real transaction. … \nC1/1/13\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 14 - Consequently, the Court considers reasonable the conclusion of the court of appeal that the \nDisputed Agreement is sham, since, according to the circumstances established by the \ncourt, in its essence it is not a residential lease agreement, but concluded by the parties in \norder to hide another transaction - a lease agreement of the premises of the hotel to carry \nout commercial activities”. \n Where a court finds that a purported transaction is a sham, it must look past the parties’ \nformal contract and apply the law directly to the substance of what was agreed. For example, \nif two parties enter into a loan agreement with the aim, not that the money will be repaid, but \nrather to misappropriate the lender’s money, then Article 235 may be applied in conjunction \nwith Article 228, the latter governing the true transaction (being a transfer of money directed \nat misappropriating the property of another). Alternatively, the Supreme Court’s Resolution \nin JSC Chornomornaftogaz v. Ukratomenergo LLC (referred to at paragraph 36 above) \nsuggests that Article 228 could be applied directly to the loan agreement in such \ncircumstances without considering Article 235:  \n“The key in the qualification of a transaction that violates public order is its illegitimate \npurpose. The intentions of the parties to the transaction are not aimed at achieving the legal \nresult provided by the transaction. … \nWhen investigating the fact of violation of public order by a court, the court must take into \naccount all aspects of its commission. The mere fact that the transaction violates a certain \nrule of law is not decisive for the conclusion that the transaction is in breach of the public \norder. Conversely, the formal observance of the legal form and content of the transaction, \nprovided that the parties pursued an illegitimate goal in concluding it, may indicate a violation \nof public order by the transaction”. \nD4. When does a transaction constitute related party lending on preferential (non-market) \nterms under Article 52 of the Law of Ukraine on Banks and Banking Activity (the “Law \non Banks”; “Article 52”), and what is the consequence? \n Article 52 of the Law on Banks prohibits a bank from entering into transactions with related \nparties on preferential or non-market terms. Prior to legislative amendments that came into \neffect on 8 March 2015, related party transactions entered into in breach of Article 52 were \nvoidable, but such transactions entered into after that date are now considered void7. \n7Law of Ukraine dated 2 March 2015 No. 218-VIII.

I consider this definition \nin more detail in response to question K1 below.

The anti-circumvention rule remains unchanged. \n14  On 12 May 2015, the NBU passed Resolution 315 adopting “Regulations on Identification of Persons \n(Parties) Related to Banks”, which inter alia  imposed obligations on banks to identify their related parties \nand report the same to the NBU and set out a list of characteristics to be considered by banks when \nidentifying related parties. \nC1/1/18\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 19 - Effect.  Preferential transactions with related parties made in breach of Article 52 of the Law \non Banks after 8 March 2015 are now considered void, as opposed to being merely voidable \n(Article 52(9) of the Law on Banks). \nD5. When does a transaction constitute an unauthorised significant transaction under \nArticle 70 of the Law of Ukraine on Joint-Stock Companies (the “JSC Law”), and what \nis the consequence? \n Under Articles 2(1)(4) and 70 of the JSC Law, a significant (or ‘major’) transaction is one \nwhose value is 10% or more of the value of the company’s assets (not net assets) according \nto its most recent annual financial statements. A company’s charter may provide additional \ncriteria allowing a transaction to be classified as significant.  \n Significant transactions must be approved by a separate resolution of the corporate body \nspecified by the JSC Law. The body competent to approve the decision depends on the \nvalue of the transaction. Where the value of the transaction is: \n between 10-25% of the company’s assets, it can only be approved by the company’s \nsupervisory board15, which must consider any such transaction submitted for its \napproval; \n between 25-50% of the company’s assets, the supervisory board must submit the \ntransaction to the company’s shareholders in general meeting for approval by a majority \nof the voting shareholders; and \n 50% or more of the company’s assets, the supervisory board shall submit it to the \nshareholders in general meeting for approval by a majority of all shareholders with \nvoting rights (whether or not they "}

A failure to take such specified action \nwould constitute a breach of each supervisory board’s members duties under the JSC Law, \nas I explain in section F below. \n15  Save in certain specified circumstances in which the company’s general meeting of shareholders can \napprove the transaction (Articles 33(1), 70(1) of the JSC Law).  \nC1/1/19\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 20 - Anti-circumvention rule.  Article 70(5) of the JSC Law prohibits dividing a transaction into \nsmaller parts with the aim of circumventing the relevant approval procedure for significant \ntransactions. \nEffect . Prior to legislative amendments that came into effect on 1 May 2016, significant \ntransactions entered into in breach of these statutory requirements were voidable. But \nfollowing an important amendment to the JSC Law, significant transactions entered into \nsince 1 May 2016 are of no legal effect unless they are later ratified by the company in \naccordance with law and its internal procedures. More particularly, Article 72 of the JSC Law \nnow provides: \n“A significant transaction or an interested party transaction entered into in breach of \nprocedures applicable to the adoption of a resolution on approval of such transaction shall \nnot give rise to, or change, or terminate, any civil rights or obligations of the joint stock \ncompany, unless the company subsequently approves that transaction in the manner \nprescribed for the adoption of a resolution on approval of such transaction” .16\n In my view, the consequences of a transaction being of no legal effect in this manner (in the \nabsence of subsequent ratification) has the same legal consequence as a transaction being \nvoid as a matter of law.  \nE. LIABILITY INTORT \nE1. What are the component elements of a claim under Article 1166 of the Ukrainian Civil \nCode (“Article 1166”)? \n Under Ukrainian law, liability for tort is governed by Chapter 82 of the Civil Code17. Article \n1166 contains the general rule: \n“Article 1166. General Grounds of Liability for Causing Harm18 to Property \n1. Property harm caused by unlawful decisions, actions or omissions to the personal \nnon-property rights of a natural or legal person, as well as harm caused to the property of a \nnatural or legal person, shall be compensated in full by the person who caused the harm. \n2. The person who caused the harm shall be exempt from paying compensation for the \nharm if he proves that the harm was caused not through his fault.  \n16  See also Kolos R., Joint Stock Companies: Practical Aspects of Changes to the Law, Yurydychna Gazeta \nonline, 14 June 2016 at 15:11.  \n17  As Ukraine has a civil law, rather than common law, tradition, the type of wrong that Article 1166 seeks to \naddress could also be referred to as the ‘general delict’, though I shall refer to it as ‘tort’ in this report. \n18  The Ukrainian word ‘shkoda’ can be translated as ‘harm’ or ‘damage’. \nC1/1/20\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 21 - 3.  ... \n4. Harm caused by lawful actions shall be compensated in the instances provided by \nthe Civil Code of Ukraine or other law”. \n Thus, the elements of the general tort liability under Ukrainian law are: \n the unlawful conduct of the tortfeasor ( ie unlawful decisions, actions or omissions); \n the occurrence of harm; \n a causal connec"}

Harm caused by lawful actions shall be compensated in the instances provided by \nthe Civil Code of Ukraine or other law”. \n Thus, the elements of the general tort liability under Ukrainian law are: \n the unlawful conduct of the tortfeasor ( ie unlawful decisions, actions or omissions); \n the occurrence of harm; \n a causal connection between the unlawful conduct and the harm; and \n the fault of the tortfeasor. \n The claimant bears the burden of proving the first three elements above, but in relation to \nthe fourth element the burden lies on the defendant (i.e. to prove absence of fault)19. \n Victim’s interests. The Civil Code enshrines as a foundational principle the right of a victim \nto protect, and seek redress for violations of, their civil rights and interests20. This is \nemphasised in Articles 3, 15 and 16 of the Civil Code: \n Article 3, “General Foundations of Civil Legislation”: “The general foundations of civil \nlegislation will be ... judicial defence of civil rights and interests ... [and] justness, good \nfaith and reasonableness ”; \n Article 15, “ Right to Defence of Civil Rights and Interests ”: “Each person shall have the \nright to the defence of his civil right in the event of a violation, failure to recognise, or \ncontesting thereof ”; and \n Article 16, “ Defence of Civil Rights and Interests in Court ”: “Each person shall have the \nright to have recourse to a court for the defence of his personal non-property or property \nright and interest. The means of defence of civil rights and interests may be ... \n19  Resolution of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court dated 25 May 2021, case No. 910/11027/18, \nUkoopspilka Joint-Stock Bank PJSC v. Person 1 et al , paragraphs 7.6 to 7.8. \n20  Similarly, the right of a victim to judicial protection is enshrined in procedural codes: see Article 4 of the \nCivil Procedural Code, Article 4 of the Commercial Procedural Code, and Article 5 of the Code of \nAdministrative Proceedings. \nC1/1/21\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 22 - compensation of losses. ... A Court may defend a civil right or interest by other means \nestablished by contract or a law ”. \n When Ukrainian courts construe the elements of liability under Article 1166, including \nconsideration of whether harm has been caused as a matter of fact, they are guided by the \noverarching objective of protecting the victim’s interests. Articles 3, 15 and 16 of the Civil \nCode are frequently referred to by the courts when considering victims’ claims for the \nrecovery of damages21. \n The primacy of protecting victims’ interests is also reflected in the principle of ‘full \ncompensation’ that arises from: \n Article 1166(1) of the Civil Code, which prescribes that “ damage to property... shall be \ncompensated in full by the person who inflicted it ”; \n Article 1192(1) of the Civil Code, which permits a court to order that a person causing \nproperty damage “ make compensation for such damage in kind … or compensate for \nthe damage caused in full ”; and \n Article 22(3) of the Civil Code, which provides that victims of tort and breach of \ncontract22 are entitled to be “ fully reimbursed ” in damages for the harm caused to them. \nE2. How is the unlawfulness of a decision, action or omission determined for purposes \nof Article 1166? \n The element of unlawfulness is interpreted widely in Ukrainian tort law. The unlawfulness of \na person’s conduct is assessed objectively, and should not be confused with fault, which is \na separate element of the general tort liability.  \n In my response below, I first explain that a defendant’s conduct can be deemed unlawful if \nit: (i) breaches a duty owed by the defendant (such as the ‘fiduciary duties’ owed by those \nin positions of authority within a bank), (ii) violates the rights of another person, or (iii) "}

I then explain that omissions as well \n21  See for example Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 29 July 2021, case No. 910/9752/16 (referring to \nArticles 15 and 16 of the Civil Code), and Resolution of the Grand Chamber of Supreme Court dated 15 \nMay 2019, case No. 717/2052/16-ts (referring to Articles 3 and 15 of the Civil Code). \n22  Articles 1166 and 1192 only concern liability in tort, whereas Article 22 applies to the whole of the law of \nobligations. \nC1/1/22\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 23 - as actions can constitute unlawful conduct, and explain two presumptions that can arise in \nrelation to the issue of unlawfulness. \n Breach of specific duty. The unlawfulness of a defendant’s conduct is commonly established \nwith reference to specific duties imposed upon that defendant to act, or not to act, in a certain \nway. An action will be unlawful if ( inter alia )it is contrary to the Ukrainian Constitution, \nlegislation, international treaty, executive orders, regulatory instruments or court judgments.  \n In section F of this report, I set out in detail the specific duties imposed by the Civil Code, \nJSC Law and Law on Banks upon individuals who exercise authority within a bank. In the \ncase of a bank’s supervisory board members, for example, their specific duties will include \nduties to act reasonably, in good faith, in the interests of a company, in accordance with the \nlaw and the company’s charter and other documents, to discharge supervisory board \nobligations personally (without delegation), to behave responsibly, to act for the benefit of \nthe bank and its clients, to place the bank’s interests above their own and to refrain from \nusing their office in their personal interests.  \n Where such specific duties arise, their breach will amount to unlawful conduct for purposes \nof the general tort liability. The Resolution of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court \ndated 25 May 2021 in case No. 910/11027/18, Ukoopspilka Joint-Stock Bank PJSC v. \nPerson 1 et al,  well illustrates this position. In that case, senior members of a bank’s \nmanagement board and supervisory board caused harm to the bank by investing around \n60% of the bank’s assets in illiquid securities of little to no value, resulting in the bank’s \ninsolvency. The Deposit Guarantee Fund of Ukraine, as the bank’s liquidator, brought a tort \nclaim against them under Article 1166 of the Civil Code, and they were found liable on the \nbasis of their breach of the specific duties that, as bank executives, they owed to the bank \nas under the Civil Code, JSC Law and Law on Banks:  \n“7.3. Article 1166(1), (2) of the Civil Code of Ukraine, which regulates the general grounds \nfor liability for caused harm, establish that property damage caused by unlawful decisions, \nactions or omissions to personal non-property rights of an individual or legal entity, as well \nas damage caused to the property of an individual or legal entity, is compensated in full by \nthe person who caused it.

The claimant in this case has exercised its right to provide evidence proving, in its \nopinion, that the defendants’ conduct was unlawful and faulty. The defendants, however, \nhave provided no evidence of their acts that would show it was no fault of theirs that the \nduties to manage the bank’s operations in good faith, reasonably and responsibly and to \nprevent potential risks as provided in the [Law on Banks] had not been fulfilled ”. \n Breach of private rights. Ukrainian law enshrines the inviolability of private property and \nprivate rights. See, in particular: \n Article 3(1)(2) of the Civil Code: “ General foundations of the civil legislation include: ... \nunacceptability of ownership deprivation except as established by the Constitution of \nUkraine and the law ”;\n Article 13(2) of the Civil Code: “ A person exercising his civil rights shall refrain from \nactions that may breach the rights of others … ”; and  \n Article 13(3) of the Civil Code: “a person’s actions aimed at hurting other persons as \nwell as abusing the right in any way shall not be acceptable ”. \n Article 3(6) of the Civil Code, whilst not referring specifically to private rights, is also relevant \nto consider: “ General foundations of the civil legislation include: ... justness, good faith and \nreasonableness ”. \n Whilst these Articles enshrine general principles of Ukrainian civil law, they also constitute \nsubstantive rules of conduct that are mandatory for all participants in civil law relationships. \nUkrainian courts, when considering whether a defendant’s conduct is contrary to Ukrainian \nlaw, will take into account not only the specific duties owed by that defendant as set out in \nUkrainian legislation, but the principles of law enshrined in those statutes and the \nConstitution. In its Resolution dated 9 February 2021 in case No. 908/1152/18, Sberbank \nJSC v. Yuststar Law Firm LLC , the Supreme Court made clear that whilst these principles \nare themselves embodied in other provisions of law, they are also directly applicable: \n11.11. … Fairness, good faith, reasonableness are among the general principles of civil law \nprovided for in Article 3 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, which restrict the freedom of contract, \nsetting a certain limit on the conduct of participants in civil relations. \nC1/1/24\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 25 - These general principles are embodied in specific rules of law and the terms of contracts, \nregulating specific situations in such a way that each party to the relationship is obliged to \nfaithfully exercise their civil rights and perform civil duties, protect their own rights and \ninterests, and care for rights and the interests of other participants, to foresee the possibility \nof inflicting harm to the rights and interests of others by their actions (inaction), to provide \nfor the possibility of adequate protection of the violated civil right or interest. \nAt the same time, the principle enshrined by the legislator of the possibility of restricting the \nfreedom of contract by virtue of the general principles of fairness, good faith, reasonableness \ncan be applied as a rule of direct action, as a direct legal means of regu"}

Such action breaches Articles 3(1)(2), \n13(2) and 13(3) of the Civil Code as I have quoted above, and such breaches (or any one \nof them) are sufficient for such conduct to be unlawful for purposes of Article 1166. This is \nso even if the conduct in question does not breach a specific obligation elsewhere described \nin law.  \n For example, in PJSC “Bank Familnyi” v. Person 1 and others , brought proceedings seeking \nto invalidate gifts made by Person 1 to his children (Person 2 and Person 3). The claim was \nbased on the fact that the Holosiivskyi District Court of Kyiv, in a separate proceeding, had \npreviously found Person 1 guilty of a crime and liable to compensate the bank for damages \ncaused to it. But after making the gifts in question, Person 1 had no assets left out of which \nto satisfy this liability. The Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court ruled that these gifts, \ndespite not violating any obligation specifically and expressly provided for under Ukrainian \nlaw, could be held invalid as a violation of the general principle set out in Article 3(6) of the \nCivil Code: \n“A civil law contract (including a gift contract) shall not be used by participants in civil \nrelations to avoid payment of a debt or execution of a court decision (including a sentence) \non the recovery of funds that has entered into force. The debtor (a donor), against whom a \njudgment on recovery of funds has been passed and enforcement proceedings have been \nopened, and his sons (donees), who enter into a gift agreement, act obviously dishonestly \nand abuse their rights against the creditor, as a gift agreement that violates the property \ninterests of the creditor and is aimed at preventing foreclosure on the debtor’s property. \nTherefore, the rule of law cannot leave out of action such actions, which, although they do \nnot violate specific imperative norms, are obviously dishonest and amount to an abuse of \nrights. Consequently, it is not ruled out that a contract aimed at avoiding the levy of an \nexecution on a debtor’s property may be held invalid under both the general principles of \ncivil law (Article 3(6) of the Ukrainian Civil Code) and the prohibition of abuse of right (Article \nC1/1/25\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 26 - 13(3) of the Ukrainian Civil Code)”23.\n Whilst the above case concerned the invalidation of a gift that violated a third party’s property \ninterests, the Supreme Court’s language above makes clear that any civil law contract, \nincluding a commercial transaction, by which funds are transferred from one person to \nanother with the intention and/or effect of harming another’s property interests can constitute \na breach of Articles 3(1)(2), 13(2) and/or 13(3) of the Civil Code. This is illustrated by case \nNo. 755/17944/18, Person 1 v. Persons 2-4 , in which the claimant lender obtained judgment \nagainst a husband and wife following the latter’s default on a loan from the claimant.

The \nhusband and wife, in order to prevent the claimant enforcing against their apartment, entered \ninto a sale-purchase agreement to sell their apartment to their son. The Supreme Court \nstated that any agreement that is entered into with the intention of harming another’s \nproperty interests constitutes a breach of Articles 3(1)(2), 13(2), and/or 13(3) of the Civil \nCode24, and after the case was sent back to the lower courts the sale-purchase agreement \nwas invalidated on this basis25.  \n Abuse of rights rule . Under Ukrainian law, an otherwise lawful exercise of one’s rights may \nbe rendered unlawful if it is done in an abusive manner or for an abusive purpose, including \nwhere it seeks to achieve an unlawful or immoral aim (Article 13(3) of the Civil Code). As \nthe extract quoted above from the PJSC “Bank Familnyi” case shows, the Grand Chamber \nof the Supreme Court in that case described Person 1’s gifts as constituting an abuse of \nright (i.e. an abuse by Person 1 of his right to transfer away his property), with reference to \nArticle 13(3). This further supported the Grand Chamber’s ruling to invalidate the gifts.  \n The PJSC “Bank Familnyi” case is but one example of the abuse of rights rule being applied \nto extend significantly the circumstances in which a party that seeks to harm the interests of \na creditor may be prevented from doing so. In particular, various Ukrainian statutes in the \nfields of bankruptcy and enforcement define certain circumstances in which a transaction by \nwhich a party alienates or encumbers their assets, or takes on additional obligations, for \nexample, in order to avoid performance of an obligation due to a creditor, are either void (for \n23  Resolution of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court Grand Chamber of 3 July 2019, No. \n369/11268/16-ts. \n24  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 7 October 2020, case No. 755/17944/18, Person 1 v. Persons 2-\n4.  \n25  Resolution of the Kyiv Court of Appeal dated 30 March 2021, case No. 755/17944/18, Person 1 v. Persons \n2-4.  \nC1/1/26\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 27 - example, Article 38(3) of the Law “On the Deposit Guarantee Fund”) or voidable (for \nexample, Article 42 of the Bankruptcy Code of Ukraine and Article 9(4) of the Law “On \nEnforcement Proceedings”). Such transactions are referred to in Ukrainian jurisprudence \ncollectively as “ fraudulent transactions ”, meaning a transaction by which a debtor aims to \nharm a creditor’s interests. But such statutes cannot and do not anticipate and describe \nevery circumstance by which a creditor’s interests can be harmed, and in the PJSC “Bank \nFamilnyi” case, the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court, supporting previous decisions of \nthe Supreme Court of Ukraine, invoked the abuse of rights rule to defeat a scheme to harm \na creditor’s rights that was not specifically covered by statute.  \n Another example is provided by the Supreme Court’s Resolution of 6 March 2019 in case \nNo. 317/3272/16-ts, Person 1 v. Person 2 , which found that spouses may not divide joint \nproperty in a manner that is abusive of their rights, such as where it is done in order to evade \ndebt recovery or judgment enforcement:  \n“According to part three of Article 13 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, actions of a person \ncommitted with the intention of causing harm to another person, as well as abuse of rights \nin other forms, are not allowed. One of the fundamental principles of civil law is good faith \n(paragraph 6 of part one of Article 3 of the Civil Code of Ukraine) and the participants in civil \nlegal relations must act in good faith.

Timsen, LLC , in which a claimant owned property \nthat was at risk of being repossessed by a bank. In order to avoid repossession, the claimant entered into \nan agreement to sell the property to the defendant. The claimant later commenced proceedings against \nthe defendant seeking to invalidate the sale agreement on grounds that it was fictitious. The Supreme \nCourt established that the agreement was indeed capable of being found to be fictitious, but it refused to \ngrant the claimant’s claim, ruling instead that the claimant was seeking to protect rights to the property that \nhe legally held, but which he had abused. \nC1/1/27\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 28 - and indicates that the categories of abuse of right are not fixed (such abuse can take other, \nunspecified forms).  \n The Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 9 February 2021 in case No. 908/1152/18, \nSberbank JSC v. Yuststar Law Firm LLC , is also relevant to consider. There, the Supreme \nCourt said (emphasis added): \n“A debtor who alienates property (performs other actions related to the reduction of its \nsolvency) after he has an obligation to repay the loan is acting in bad faith and abusing the \nrights with regard to the creditor. Therefore, the rule of law cannot leave such actions without \nreaction, which, although they do not violate specific imperative norms, however, are \nobviously unfair and make the abuse of the right aimed at preventing (avoiding) satisfaction \nof the claims of such a creditor. \nAny transaction made by the debtor during the period of his obligation to repay the debt to \nthe creditor, as a result of which the debtor ceases to be solvent, shall be questioned in \nterms of its good faith as it has signs of a fraudulent transaction (transaction made by the \ndebtor to the detriment of creditors). \n11.8.

The \ntransaction of the owner of a property to dispose of property belonging to him in order to \nprevent satisfaction of the claim of another person - the claimant at the expense of the \nproperty of this owner, can be qualified as abuse of property right, as the owner uses the \nright to dispose of property to the detriment of creditor`s property interests. \nThe circumstances alleged by the claimant and established by the courts indicate that the \ndisputed surety agreement was not aimed at the actual occurrence of the legal \nconsequences stipulated by it, the conclusion of the disputed transaction was used by its \nparticipants to avoid payment of debts to the claimant, namely, with aim to harm other person \n28  Article 203 of the Civil Code sets down the general requirements for a transaction to be valid. I quote Article \n203 at paragraph 30 above. \nC1/1/28\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 29 - that is a form of abuse of right. Such actions of the parties to the transaction do not meet the \ncriteria of good faith, fairness and inadmissibility of abuse of rights. \nIn these circumstances, the disputed surety agreement may be classified as a transaction \nin which the defendants acted in bad faith and abused the rights in respect to the claimant \nin order to avoid satisfaction of the claimant’s demands as a creditor, so this transaction is \na fraudulent transaction”. \n The abuse of rights rule has developed relatively recently under Ukrainian law and is still \nevolving. Whilst the above cases concerned transactions aimed at making assets \nunavailable to creditors, the language of the Supreme Court Resolutions quoted above \nmakes clear that the abuse of rights rule is not limited in its application to such situations. \nThe abuse of rights rule has been described as follows in the commentary to Article 13 of \nthe Civil Code in Kharitonov E.Y., Golubeva N.Y. (ed.) Civil Code of Ukraine. Academic and \nPractical Commentary. X.: Odesa, 2010, which emphasises the generality of the rule’s \napplication:  \n“Abuse of rights [may be] connected to the use of prohibited forms of exercising them... an \nabuse of rights, like any breach of rights, incurs a sanction. The general sanction is \nprescribed at Article 16 of the Civil Code, which establishes refusal to protect a right that is \nbeing exercised in an improper manner.

Article 1166 expressly provides that unlawful conduct for purposes of the \ngeneral tort liability can consist of “ decisions, actions or omissions ” (see paragraph 64 \nabove). In response to question F2 below, I conclude that the various specific duties \nimposed upon individuals of authority within a bank, breach of which constitutes unlawful \nconduct for purposes of the general tort liability, also can be breached by omission as well \nas action.  \n In relation to the two types of unlawful conduct that I have discussed immediately above \n(conduct intended to or effecting a breach of another person’s private rights and conduct \ninvolving the abusive exercise of one’s own legal rights), however, I note that some (but not \nall) of the general principles of the Civil Code violated by such conduct refer specifically to \n“actions ”, not omissions: \n Article 13(2) of the Civil Code: “ A person exercising his civil rights shall refrain from \nactions that may breach the rights of others … ”; and  \n Article 13(3) of the Civil Code: “a person’s actions aimed at hurting other persons as \nwell as abusing the right in any way shall not be acceptable ”.\n Nevertheless, I consider that my opinions as set out above concerning the unlawfulness of \nconduct that violates the private rights of another or otherwise amounts to an abuse of rights \napply equally when such conduct consists of a failure to act (an omission) rather than a \npositive action. In this regard, I note that: \n the word ‘actions’ does not appear in Article 3(1)(2), which establishes the principle that \ndepriving a person of their ownership rights, save as permitted by the Constitution of \nUkraine and the law, is unacceptable: “ General foundations of the civil legislation \ninclude: ... unacceptability of ownership deprivation except as established by the \nConstitution of Ukraine and the law”; \n29  Article 13 of the Civil Code provides “ A person exercising his civil rights shall follow public morals”.\nC1/1/30\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 31 -  Article 13(3) expressly states that “ as well as ” prohibiting “ actions ” that are aimed at \nhurting another person, it also prohibits abuses of rights “"}

Limited \nLiability Company “Truskavets Vodokanal” . In that case, the defendant failed to perform \nactions required by law in relation to the calculation of tariffs for services for centralised water \nsupply, in relation to which the Supreme Court stated “ these actions are abuse of right in the \nform of inaction ”. \n Presumptions relevant to issue of unlawfulness. Ukraine’s new Supreme Court has \nrepeatedly stated that any conduct that causes harm shall be deemed unlawful unless the \ndefendant can demonstrate that its conduct was authorised or otherwise in accordance with \nlaw. For example, in its Resolution dated 29 January 2019 in case No. 922/1153/16, Akinina \nv. Belchenko et al ., the Supreme Court stated: “ Any behaviour that results in harm can be \nconsidered unlawful, if the inflictor of harm was not authorised to do so ”30. I consider, \ntherefore, that under Ukrainian law the unlawfulness of a defendant’s conduct will be \npresumed if that conduct is shown to have caused harm (the burden would then shift to the \ndefendant to show absence of fault). \n On 25 May 2021, however, the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court issued its Resolution \nin case No. 910/11027/18, Ukoopspilka Joint-Stock Bank PJSC v. Person 1 et al (discussed \nat paragraph 74 above , which introduced a presumption going the other way, namely that \nthe conduct of an officer of a legal entity will be presumed to be in accordance with that \nofficer’s so-called “ fiduciary duties ” as owed to that legal entity:  \n30  The same was stated again by the Supreme Court in its Resolution dated 7 June 2019, case No. \n914/1960/17, Western Region Military Prosecutor v. Kostopol Forestry . See also the Supreme Court’s \nResolution dated 28 February 2018, case No. 675/2108/15-ts, Person 3 v.

In relation to the present issue (of how unlawfulness is \ndetermined for purposes of the general tort liability), it suffices to note that, where one is \nconcerned with the conduct of a company officer owing fiduciary duties, this presumption \neffectively operates as an exception to the general rule that conduct causing harm will be \npresumed to be unlawful unless the defendant demonstrates that its conduct was authorised \nor otherwise in accordance with law. \n Where the presumption that a company’s officer has complied with their fiduciary duties \narises in a tort claim brought against that officer, the burden will fall on the claimant to adduce \nevidence that the officer in fact breached those duties or otherwise acted unlawfully in order \nto satisfy the requirements of Article 1166.  \nE3. Is the Defendants’ conduct about which the Bank complains in these proceedings (if \nestablished): \na) prohibited under Ukrainian law only by the Criminal Code?  \n I am very familiar with the Bank’s complaints in these proceedings, having provided at their \noutset in December 2017 my first expert report setting out my opinion as to the causes of \naction under Ukrainian law that would arise on the facts as alleged by the Bank at the time. \nIn the course of preparing this report, I have also read all of the parties’ Statements of Case, \nas amended, and reviewed certain of the Bank’s Statements of Facts and certain of the \nparties’ witness statements as provided to me by Hogan Lovells (as listed in Appendix II). \n Whilst the conduct about which the Bank complains, i.e. embezzlement or misappropriation \nof funds, is of a type recognised by Ukrainian law to be criminally punishable conduct (for \ninstance, under Articles 190 or 191 of the Criminal Code), such conduct separately will give \nC1/1/32\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 33 - rise to civil liability under Article 1166 of the Civil Code to the extent that the necessary four \nelements of that liability (as I have described above) are present (i.e. if the conduct is \nunlawful, causes harm and no defence of absence of fault applies). Ukrainian tort law thus \nprovides a standalone basis (independent of the criminal law) for legal consequences to be \nimposed by the courts to sanction such embezzlement or misappropriation. I do not \nconsider, therefore, that in Ukraine it is only the criminal law that prohibits such conduct, and \nI am supported in this view by the cases I discuss in response to the next question. \nb) capable of being relied upon as constituting unlawful conduct for purposes of \nArticle 1166 notwithstanding that it has not been determined to be criminal by a \ncriminal court? \n As I have explained above, even where conduct amounts to criminal behaviour under \nUkrainian law, it can still be relied upon as unlawful conduct for purposes of Article 1166. \nThis is so even if that conduct is not prosecuted as a crime. If the elements of a claim under \nArticle 1166 are made out, then the victim has a claim in tort, whether or not the perpetrator \nis or may become the subject of a criminal conviction. The same applies equally to any claim \nthat the victim may have in unjust enrichment under Article 1212 of the Civil Code (which I \nconsider in section G below). \n Consistent with this, under Ukrainian law a victim who suffers harm as a result of a crime \nmay seek civil compensation from the perpetrator either within any criminal proceedings that \nare brought against the perpetrator or in separate civil proceedings.

That Ukrainian law \nenvisages the possibility of a victim’s civil claim proceeding separately from, or in the \nabsence of, criminal proceedings arising out of the same facts, supports my view that a \ndefendant’s actions (or omissions) may be relied upon as constituting unlawful conduct for \npurposes of Article 1166 notwithstanding that the same has not been determined to be \ncriminal by a criminal court.  \n My view is also borne out by the existence under Ukrainian law of a presumption that \nconduct causing harm to another is unlawful for purposes of Article 1166 (see paragraph 93 \nabove). Such a presumption is incompatible with the suggestion that the unlawfulness of a \ndefendant’s conduct for purposes of a tort claim must be established in criminal proceedings. \n This position is demonstrated by the Supreme Court’s decision in case No. 662/1135/15-ts, \nPerson 4 v. Person 5 . There, the claimant (Person 4) was physically assaulted and had his \narm broken by the defendant (Person 5). A criminal investigation followed, but no charges \nwere brought against Person 5, who was not even named as a criminal suspect. In \nsubsequent civil (tort) proceedings brought by Person 4, Person 5 argued in defence that in \nthe absence of a criminal verdict against him in relation to his alleged conduct, he could not \nbe held liable in tort. The Supreme Court rejected this argument in its Resolution dated 21 \nFebruary 2018, stating:  \n“The arguments of the cassation appeal that, taking into account the provisions of Article 62 \nof the Constitution of Ukraine, in the absence of a court judgment on the prosecution the \nrespondent to criminal liability, the decision of the court of appeal is illegal, do not rectify the \nconclusions of the court of appeal. \nAccording to part 4 of Article 61 of the CCivP (as amended as to 18 March 2004, No. 1618-\nIV) a verdict in a criminal proceeding that entered into legal force, or a court decision in an \nadministrative offense case is binding on the court which considering the case on the civil-\nlaw consequences of actions of the person against whom a verdict or court decision was \nruled, on whether these actions took place and whether they were committed by this person. \n"}

In the absence of a court verdict, the facts mentioned above are to be established \nin the said civil case. The commission of an offence by a person leads to legal liability. Civil \nliability arises for, among other things, the infliction of non-contractual harm against a \nperson”33.\n That tort liability can be established in civil proceedings regardless of the presence or \nabsence of a criminal verdict in relation to the same facts is also clear from the following \nextract from the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 3 July 2019 in case No. \n756/15544/15-ts, PJSC “Insurance Company Sovereign” v. Person 1 :\n“At the same time, the absence of a court verdict in criminal proceedings or a court decision \nin the case of an administrative offense based on the results of the investigation into the \ncircumstances of the accident does not relieve the defendant in a civil process from the \nobligation to prove absence of his fault, given the second part of Article 1166 of the Civil \nCode of Ukraine”34.\n Lastly, I would also note that, in the field of bankruptcy law, where harm is frequently caused \nto legal entities (resulting in their insolvency) by actions that are criminally punishable, the \nSupreme Court recently has made clear that a criminal verdict is not necessary in order for \ncivil liability to be imposed in respect of such conduct: \n“32. Since the legislation does not connect the possibility of imposing subsidiary liability on \nthird parties with the existence of a criminal sentence against such persons on the \nestablishment of a criminal offense in their actions (inaction), in this case, persons, by virtue \nof a special prescription of the Code, are brought to civil liability in the form of joint and \nseveral penalties”35. \nE4. What constitutes ‘harm’ for purposes of Article 1166? \n The concept of harm is a wide one under Ukrainian law and includes harm caused to \nproperty and property rights, or to personal non-property rights (other provisions of Chapter \n82 of the Civil Code govern personal injury claims and claims for moral damages, including \n31  The judgment refers to “PERSON 8” rather than Person 5, but in context, this is clearly a typographical \nerror. \n32  For the avoidance of doubt, had Person 5 been convicted of a crime, the criminal court’s findings would \nhave been admissible in Person 4’s subsequent civil claim as evidence of Person 5’s unlawful acts. In the \nabsence of any such conviction, Person 4 was required to prove that Person 5 committed the alleged \nunlawful acts. \n33  Resolution of the Supreme Court of 21 February 2018, No. 662/1135/15-ts. \n34  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 3 July 2019, case No. 756/15544/15-ts. \n35  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 17 June 2020, case No. 924/669/17, PJSC National Joint Stock \nCompany “Naftogaz of Ukraine” v.

As explained at paragraph \n69 above, under Ukrainian law victims of tort are to receive full compensation for harm \ncaused to them (Articles 1166(1), 1192(1) and 22(3) of the Civil Code).  \n Property under Ukrainian law includes money, whether in the form of cash or in a bank \naccount, shares and other items that may be the subject of property rights (Articles 177, 179 \nand 190 of the Civil Code). An electronic transfer of funds from one person to another is thus \ncapable of constituting harm to the transferor. \n For the purposes of Article 1166, harm includes economic or financial loss. Article 22 of the \nCivil Code contains the general rules on damages applying to both contractual and non-\ncontractual claims36 and it includes amongst recoverable heads of loss: (i) a claimant’s \nexpenditure to restore their violated right, and (ii) a claimant’s lost profits or foregone benefit: \n“Article 22. Compensation for losses and other methods of compensation for property \ndamage \n1. A person who has suffered damage as a result of violation of his civil right has the \nright to compensation. \n2. Losses are: \n“1) the loss suffered by a person in connection with destruction or damage to a \nthing, as well as the expenses that the person has or should incur to restore his \nviolated right (actual damage); \n2) income that a person could actually receive in normal circumstances, if his \nright was not violated (loss of profit). \n3. Damages are fully reimbursed if the agreement or the law does not provide for \ncompensation in a smaller or larger amount37.\nIf the person who violated the right has received income in connection with this, then the \namount of lost profits to be reimbursed to the person whose right is violated cannot be less \nthan the income received by the person who violated the right. \n4. At the request of the person who is harmed and in accordance with the \ncircumstances of the case, the damage may be compensated in another way, in particular, \ndamage caused to property may be compensated in kind (passing things of the same kind \n36  The Ukrainian courts have consistently held that Article 22 applies to claims under Article 1166. See for \nexample Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 6 May 2020, case No. 742/554/19; and Resolution of the \nSupreme Court dated 5 October 2021, case No. 925/247/20. \n37  In the context of a tort claim, I understand this provision to mean that a victim of tortious conduct must be \nfully reimbursed for the loss caused to them by that conduct (as also required by Articles 1166(1) and \n1192(1) of the Civil Code), unless the law otherwise provides for them to be compensated in some smaller \nor larger amount. \nC1/1/36\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 37 - and the same quality, repairing the damaged thing etc)”.\n Quantification: The issue of whether a particular type of harm is compensable in damages \nis a question of Ukrainian law to be answered with reference to the provisions of the Civil \nCode I have referred to above.

What is the test for causation under Article 1166? \n Under Ukrainian law, there are no special statutory rules governing the issue of causation, \nwhich is treated as a question of fact. In general the question that will be asked by a \nUkrainian court is whether the damage or loss would have occurred but for the defendant’s \nunlawful conduct, save for situations where the defendant has caused the harm jointly with \nothers (which I address in response to question E12 below). \n According to paragraph 2 of the Supreme Court’s Plenary Resolution No. 6 “On Case Law \non Civil Tort Claims”, dated 27 March 1992: \n“personal and property harm caused to an individual or property harm caused to a legal \nentity must be compensated in full by the tortfeasor, provided that the latter’s conduct was \nunlawful and there is a direct causal link between the conduct and the harm and that such \nperson is at fault, or, where this has resulted from a source of extreme danger, regardless \nof whether there is fault”38. \n More recently, the Supreme Court has described the element of causation as follows:  \n“… a causal link between the tortfeasor’s wrongdoing and the harm caused to the injured \nparty is one of the mandatory conditions for tort liability to arise. Determining a causal link is \nnecessary both to secure the interests of the injured party and to exercise the principle of \ngood faith in ordering a person to compensate for the harm inflicted.  \nA causal link between a person’s actions and the infliction of harm involves the harm being \nthe consequence of that person’s wrongdoing, rather than any other circumstances. An \nordinary sequence of events must not be taken into account. An objective causal link as a \ncondition to liability performs the function of defining an objective legal limit of liability for the \nharmful consequences of the wrongdoing. A tortfeasor is not liable for any harm, but for the \n38  Paragraph 2 of the Supreme Court’s Plenary Resolution No. 6 “On Case Law on Civil Tort Claims”, dated \n27 March 1992. \nC1/1/37\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 38 - harm caused by his conduct. A lack of causation means that the harm has been caused by \nother circumstances, rather than the tortfeasor’s conduct. \nFurther, a causal link between the tortfeasor’s wrongdoing and the harm must be direct, \nwhich is the case where the harm was caused by a particular conduct, without any additional \nfactors. Where the unlawful conduct that gave rise to a specific ability to inflict harm makes \nit real only if combined with a third party’s wrongful act, a legally significant causal link must \nbe established with both the conduct, which gave rise to that specific ability (the conditions \nfor inflicting the harm), and the acts that made it real (the actual infliction of the harm) … ”39. \n At questions E12 to E15 below, I consider at length Article 1190 of the Civil Code, pursuant \nto which two or more parties that jointly cause harm to another can be held jointly and \nseverally liable for the harm caused for purposes of a tort claim under Article 1166. As I \nexplain in response to question E11, in such a case the issue of causation is determined by \nconsidering whether the conduct of the defendants when taken together caused harm to the \nclaimant. \nE6.

I do not consider that the \nDefendants could succeed on an argument that when making the Unreturned Prepayments \nthe Borrowers were transferring their ‘own’ funds such that loss was not caused to the Bank.  \n39  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 24 April 2019, case No. 355/1014/16-ts, Person 1 v. Military \nProsecutor’s Office of the Central Region of Ukraine and others . \nC1/1/38\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 39 -  First, under Article 1190 of the Civil Code, where two or more parties jointly cause harm to \nanother, then they are both jointly and severally liable for the harm caused for purposes of \na tort claim under Article 1166 (I consider Article 1190 in more detail below in my responses \nto questions E12 to E15). In this context, it does not matter whether the Borrowers ever held \nformal title to the funds or whether the Defendant Suppliers obtained the funds directly from \nthe Bank or not; the question is whether the Defendants’ alleged actions jointly caused harm \nto the Bank. \n Secondly, the Bank alleges in these proceedings that both the Relevant Loan Agreements \nand Supply Agreements were entered into in order to effect and/or disguise the \nembezzlement of the Bank’s funds and are void (as transactions contrary to public order \npursuant to Article 228 of the Civil Code and/or as sham transactions under Article 235 of \nthe Civil Code). If the Bank is correct that the Relevant Loan Agreements and Supply \nAgreements are void, then as a matter of Ukrainian law those transactions will be void ab \ninitio and will have only the legal consequences associated with their invalidity (such as \nrestitution of property passing under that transaction pursuant to Article 216(1) of the Civil \nCode, and liability in damages pursuant to Article 216(2) of the Civil Code). If the Relevant \nLoans and Supply Agreements are void, the Borrowers had no entitlement to any funds \npassing thereunder. As the Defendants could not, therefore, claim that the Borrowers had \nany entitlement to the funds that they received pursuant to the invalid Relevant Loan \nAgreements, they could not maintain an argument that the Bank suffered no loss as a result \nof the Unreturned Prepayments due to the funds in question belonging to the Borrowers, not \nthe Bank. \nb) at all times the monies involved in the Misappropriation remained in accounts \nheld with the Bank (and so arguably never left the Bank)? \n The fact that some or all of the funds remained, or may remain, in accounts held at the Bank \nis irrelevant to whether the Bank has suffered harm within the meaning of Article 1166.

What \nmatters is whether the Defendants’ alleged acts have unlawfully diminished the overall \namount of funds to which the Bank is entitled.  \n Bank accounts are accounting devices that allow banks to record transactions involving the \nfunds of each of their clients. Money denoted as being in the account of a particular customer \nis the property of that customer, not the bank. This is reflected in Article 1066 of the Civil \nCode, which provides: \nC1/1/39\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 40 - “Article 1066. Agreement on bank account \n1. According to bank account agreement the bank undertakes to accept and credit to the \naccount open by the client (to the owner of the client) funds transferred to him [the client], to \nfulfill instructions of the client on transfer or issuance of relevant amounts from the account \nand performance of other operations on the account. \n2. The bank has the right to use funds on the client’s account by granting his [client’s] right \nto freely dispose such funds. \n3. The Bank has no right to determine or control use of funds of the client and to establish. \nother than prescribed by the agreement or the law, limitations of its [client’s] right to use \nfunds in its own discretion”40. \n See also the Resolution of the High Commercial Court dated 5 August 2015 in case No. \n910/28483/14, State Enterprise Hotel Complex National v. PJSC Zlatobank :“in all \ncircumstances, the defendant is the owner of funds in the account he owns, and his right of \nownership by virtue of Article 41 of the Constitution of Ukraine and Article 321 of the Civil \nCode of Ukraine is inviolable ”. \n So where, for example, a customer owes money to a bank, a bank cannot assert ownership \nof funds held in other of that customer’s accounts and, at its own discretion, collect such \nfunds to satisfy that debt. Instead, to proceed against the funds in such other customer \naccounts the bank would have to rely on a right granted to it by contract or obtain a court \njudgment allowing the debt to be enforced against such funds. In particular, Article 1071 of \nthe Civil Code provides: \n“Article 1071. Grounds for debiting funds from an account \n1. The bank can write off funds from the client’s account based on his [i.e. the client’s] order. \n2. Funds may be debited from the client’s account without his order based on a court \ndecision, as well as in cases established by law, an agreement between the bank and the \nclient or the terms of encumbrance, the subject of which is property rights to funds in the \nbank account”. \n The same applies even where a bank’s money has been transferred to a customer’s account \npursuant to a void transaction (such as a fraudulent loan agreement). Unless the customer \nagrees that it may do so, the bank cannot at its discretion transfer those funds out of that \ncustomer’s account, but must first obtain a court judgment entitling it to do so (for example \n40  Version in effect as of the end of 2016. \nC1/1/40\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 41 - by bringing a successful claim in tort or unjust enrichment).

If that is correct, then any alleged \ncontractual liability on the part of the Borrowers to pay sums to the Bank, including interest, \ncan be disregarded as non-existent.  \n More generally, if A misappropriates funds from B by procuring a fraudulent contract \nbetween B and C, I believe a Ukrainian court would consider it absurd if A could avoid liability \nin tort by relying on a provision of the fraudulent contract stating that C would return those \nfunds to B. Whilst I have been unable to find any Ukrainian court judgments involving \nanalogous facts to support my view, this is perhaps unsurprising given the unusual facts in \nthis hypothetical scenario. \n41  The parties to a void transaction may apply the legal consequences of the transaction’s invalidity on their \nown only where all parties agree that transaction is void.  \n42  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 10 April 2019, case No. 463/5896/14-ts, PJSC Derzhavnyi \nOshchadnyi Bank of Ukraine v.

For the avoidance of doubt, as I have explained in response to \nquestion D1 above, where a transaction is void (as opposed to voidable), the transaction is deemed invalid \nab initio  as a matter of law and no action or court order is required to set it aside (Articles 215(2), 236(1) \nof the Civil Code).  \nC1/1/41\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 42 - d) the monies received by the Defendant Suppliers were not the same monies (in \nthe proprietary sense) that were transferred by the Bank to the Borrowers? \n The Bank’s case in tort (as I understand from the Bank’s Statements of Case) is in summary \nthat the Defendants’ conduct, when taken together, jointly caused the misappropriation of \nUSD 1,911,877,385 from the Bank in the form of the Relevant Loans extended by the Bank \nto the Borrowers, which loans caused the Unreturned Prepayments to be made by the \nBorrowers to the Defendant Suppliers, the sum total of which quantifies the harm suffered \nby the Bank (prior to any reductions in the quantum of that harm that are appropriate on the \nfacts of the case). \n For the purposes of this tort claim it is sufficient for the Bank to show that the Defendants’ \njoint conduct caused harm to it, i.e. caused the Relevant Loans and the subsequent \nUnrelated Prepayments (between which there is, on the Bank’s case, a causal connection). \nAs I have stated above, under Ukrainian law, both causation and quantification of harm are \nquestions of fact, but in this case neither depends upon whether the Defendant Suppliers \nreceived any part of the very same monies (in the propr"}

Liability in tort for the theft of funds disguised by a sham loan is not \nremedied or discharged by using those funds to pay off another, separate liability in contract, \nbecause in my opinion this would not result in the victim of the theft being fully compensated \nfor the loss in fact caused by the later tortious act. \nC1/1/42\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 43 -  Putting the principle in general terms: if A lawfully borrows €100 from B, but a week later \nsteals €100 from B’s wallet which he then gives to B to repay his loan, B has still suffered \nloss in the amount of €100 as a result of A’s unlawful conduct (for which B is entitled to be \ncompensated in full).  \n Therefore, I do not consider that in the posited scenario the Bank would have to give credit \n(i.e. so as to reduce the Bank’s loss resulting from the Misappropriation) to the tortfeasors \nfor the amount of any earlier loan that was repaid using a Borrower’s drawndown funds \nwhich otherwise would not have been repaid.  \n If the earlier debt could have been repaid, then B’s loss from the later theft is obviously not \nreduced by the repayment of that earlier debt because B has been deprived of a valuable \nclaim as a result of A’s acts. However, even assuming it can be shown that the earlier loan \nwould never have been repaid but for the theft of funds from B at a later date, B’s loss \nresulting from that theft would not have to be reduced by the amount of the repayment. B \ncould still have claims in respect of that bad debt, including claims in bankruptcy or \nliquidation proceedings, claims against third parties and/or claims in tort or unjust enrichment \n(depending on all the circumstances of the case). Where A has stolen funds from B then \nused those funds to repay an earlier bad debt so as effectively to preclude all potential claims \nby B related to that bad debt, I do not consider that the same repayment will have reduced \nthe loss that A caused to B by the theft. \n It makes no difference to my analysis above if A used the €100 that it stole from B’s wallet \nto repay an earlier loan advanced by B to a third party C.

In this scenario, a further reason for my conclusion is that A’s agreement with C for A \nto pay off C’s debt to B, a decision to which B is a stranger, should not operate to effect \nrights and obligations as between A and B, including A’s liability in tort to B and B’s right to \nbe fully compensated for the loss caused to it by A. Article 511(1) of the Civil Code provides \nin relevant part: “ An obligation [meaning an obligation between two persons] does not create \na duty for a third party ”.  \n Perhaps unsurprisingly given the unusual fact pattern in the posited scenario, I have been \nunable to find any Ukrainian court judgments involving analogous facts, i.e. where a tort \nclaim has been brought in relation to a fraud involving loans being used to repay earlier \nloans. I therefore base my conclusions above on first principles, in particular the principle of \nC1/1/43\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 44 - full compensation for loss (Articles 1161(1), 1192(1) and 22(3) of the Civil Code) and \nprinciples of justice, reasonableness and fairness (Article 3(6)), with which I consider my \nviews accord.  \n In the absence of relevant Ukrainian caselaw, I have been asked to consider and comment \nupon paragraphs 1186 and 1196 of the judgment in the English case National Bank Trust v \nYurov and ors  [2020] EWHC 100 (Comm), a copy of which has been provided to me. I \nunderstand that in these paragraphs the English court was seeking to interpret Russian law \n(which similarly applies a requirement for ‘full compensation’ of tortious loss), which it did in \npart by considering how the issues would be addressed under English law. The court \nconcluded (at paragraph 1193) that it would be “ obviously (and demonstrably) wrong ” if “a \nfraudster could steal from the Bank to repay his own indebtedness and then claim that the \nBank has suffered no loss as a result of his theft ”, and “ [t]he position would be no different \nif the fraudster was a different individual, B, who dishonestly obtained the money and passed \nit to A (whether as a conspirator or a benevolent bystander) so that he could repay his debt ”. \nWhilst I cannot comment upon the correctness of the court’s conclusions as a matter of \nEnglish (or Russian) law, I note that they appear to accord with my own conclusions reached \nabove on the basis of relevant Ukrainian law principles. \n For the foregoing reasons, I consider that if the monies advanced by the Bank under the \nRelevant Loans were themselves used purportedly to repay earlier loans advanced by the \nBank, this would make no difference to the Bank’s tort claim including as regards the \nquantum of loss the Bank can claim was caused by the Misappropriation. For the avoidance \nof doubt, however, the Bank could not recover its loss in tort caused by the Misappropriation \nand then collect the same amount as a contractual debt from the debtors whose debts the \nfunds were used to discharge, as that would constitute double recovery. \nf) a number of purported cash repayments of the capital advanced under the Relevant \nLoans and/or interest were made from funds advanced by the Bank under other \nRelevant Loans or Intermediary Loans or New Loans, all of which were void (on \ngrounds of being contrary to Ukrainian public order, shams, related party lending on \npreferential terms and/or unauthorised significant transactions)? \n As noted above, I have not found any Ukrainian cases where a tort claim has been brought \nin relation to a fraud involving loans being used to repay earlier loans.

For the reasons given \nbelow, however, I consider that where monies purportedly used to repay an unlawful loan \n(“loan 1”) are themselves referable to other, unlawful lending (“loan 2”), then the purported \nC1/1/44\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 45 - repayment of loan 1 would not operate to reduce the lender’s loss caused by loan 1, for \nwhich the lender would remain entitled to be fully compensated.  \n As I have explained in response to question D1 above, a void transaction is void ab initio . A \nvoid transaction will have the legal consequences associated with its invalidity, such as \nrestitution of property passing under that transaction pursuant to Article 216(1) of the Civil \nCode, and liability in damages pursuant to Article 216(2) of the Civil Code, but, on the basis \nthat in the posited scenario, loan 2 is void, a Ukrainian court would not uphold its purported \neffect in discharging (or reducing) the liability in tort arising from loan 1.  \n Putting the point another way, in my view where a tortfeasor causes harm to a victim, the \ntortfeasor cannot be allowed to eliminate that harm by stealing money from the victim at a \nlater date then returning it to the victim in purported compensation for the earlier tort. Whilst, \nperhaps unsurprisingly, I have not found any caselaw on this point, I am confident that a \nUkrainian court would reject any such suggestion. It would create a perverse incentive for \nthe tortfeasor (who could, for example, eliminate liability for a discovered tort by committing \na further tort that might not be discovered) and in my view would be contrary to principles of \njustice, reasonableness and fairness (Article 3(6) of the Civil Code). \n If a court were to approach the quantification of the loss caused to the bank in this scenario \n(and I would note again that both causation and quantification of harm are questions of fact \nultimately for the court to decide) by assessing the loss caused by each of the independent \ntortious acts represented by loan 1 and loan 2, respectively, then I would consider such loss \nto be (for each tort) the amount of that loan less any genuine compensation received in \nrelation to that tortious loss (i.e. excluding purported loan repayments referable to other \nunlawful loans), together with any damages recoverable under Article 22, such as interest \n(addressed in section J below) and/or opportunity cost flowing from the loss of use of those \nfunds in the interim (Article 22(2)(2) of the Civil Code; see my response to question E4 \nabove)43. There is no rule of Ukrainian law that would oblige the victim in such circumstances \nto sue the wrongdoer in relation to one instance of misappropriation rather than the other; \nthe victim could choose which instance of misappropriation to sue upon, but would not be \npermitted to double recover. I consider my view in this regard to be consistent with the \n43  Similar remedies could also be pursued in unjust enrichment against any person that received the \nmisappropriated funds without lawful grounds, even if that person was not a person that had inflicted harm \non the Bank for purposes of Article 1166 of the Civil Code (this is dealt with in section G below), although \nthe Bank could not collect the same loss more than once. \nC1/1/45\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 46 - position under Ukrainian law that where tortfeasors jointly cause harm to a victim in the \namount of €100 (for example), the victim may elect to sue either of them for €100 or sue \nboth of them for the full €100 each, provided they do not ult"}

A number of purported repayments of the capital advanced under the Relevant Loans \nand/or Intermediary Loans and/or interest were made by crediting the Borrowers’ / \nIntermediary Borrowers’ accounts in return for assets purportedly pledged to the \nBank to secure the Relevant Loans / Intermediary Loans and then transferred to the \nBank between March and September 2016.  \nIn relation to this, what is the effect on the quantum of the loss caused by the \nMisappropriation that the Bank can claim under Article 1166 where: \na) the Bank lawfully retains such an asset on its books? In particular, would the \nBank be bound by any inflated valuation of that asset as set out in that pledge \nagreement and/or as recorded in the Bank’s transactional data?  \n I note, first of all, that if the Bank is correct that the Relevant Loans and Intermediary Loans \nare void then any agreements purporting to provide security in relation to those loans will \nalso be void. In particular: \n Article 3(5) of the Law on Mortgages45 provides that a mortgage is derived from the \nobligation that it secures and is valid until the termination of the secured obligation or \nuntil the expiration of the mortgage agreement; and  \n Article 548(2) of the Civil Code provides that where the main obligation secured by a \npledge is invalid, the pledge also is invalid46.  \n44  Article 543 of the Civil Code provides: “ Article 543. Joint and several obligation of debtors; (1) In the event \nof a joint and several obligation of debtors (joint and several debtors), the creditor shall have the right to \ndemand the fulfillment of the obligation in part or in full both from all the debtors together and from any of \nthem separately ”. \n45  The Law on Mortgages governs pledges of immovable property, rights to real estate, air and sea vessels, \ninland navigation vessels and space objects.  \n46  For an illustration of the application of these rules, see for example the Supreme Court’s \nResolution of 27 November 2019 in case No. 0907/17918/2012, Zoloti Vorota Bank PJSC v. \nPerson 1 . \nC1/1/46\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 47 -  Where property passes under an invalid transaction (such as under the pledge agreements \nsecuring void loans in the posited scenario) prima facie this will give rise to a duty of \nrestitution under Article 216(1) of the Civil Code.

In my view, the \nabuse of rights rule can be applied when transactions are entered into to harm creditors’ \ninterests in other ways, such as by concealing or disguising a fraud committed against a \ncreditor, limiting the resources or remedies available to a creditor to restore their rights, or \nhindering or delaying a creditor’s enforcement of their rights. \n I consider, therefore, that if the Relevant Loans and Intermediary Loans are found to have \nbeen purportedly secured (whether initially or at a later date) by pledges of no (or insufficient \nand/or overstated) value, and it is found that the pledgors did so in order to give a false \nimpression that valuable security had been provided for those Loans, to facilitate the \nMisappropriation, and/or to conceal the harm caused to the Bank by the Misappropriation, \nthen such pledges would as a matter of Ukrainian law be treated as part of the tortious \nscheme aimed at defrauding the Bank. Consequently, the Bank would be able to invoke the \nabuse of rights rule and retain any assets pledged to it, on the basis that because the \npledgors’ conduct violated principles of Ukrainian law (as referred to in the above Supreme \nCourt Resolutions) and was intended to harm the Bank’s interests, it was therefore abusive, \nand so the pledgors’ right to restitution of the pledged assets should not be upheld.  \nC1/1/47\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 48 -  Quantifying the reduction to the Bank’s loss. In such circumstances, the quantification of the \nBank’s loss resulting from the Misappropriation, including any reduction to that loss by the \nvalue of assets transferred to the Bank in purported repayment of the Relevant/Intermediary \nLoans, would fall to be assessed as a matter of fact (both causation and quantification of \nharm are matters of fact under Ukrainian law; see my response to questions E4 and E5 \nabove) and in accordance with the general rules regarding damages set out in Article 22 of \nthe Civil Code (quoted at paragraph 108 above), including the principle that the Bank is \nentitled to be fully compensated for its loss caused by the Defendants’ tortious conduct \n(Articles 1161(1), 1192(1) and 22(3) of the Civil Code).  \n Further in my view, to the extent that any assets passing to the Bank under such void \npledges are lawfully retained by the Bank for its own benefit (such as where the pledgors’ \nright to restitution of the pledged assets is defeated by the abuse of rights rule), the Bank’s \nloss resulting from the Misappropriation should be reduced by the assets’ true value at the \ntime of their acquisition, which would be a matter of fact to be determined by way of valuation \nevidence47.  \n I base this opinion principally on the consideration that reducing the Bank’s loss by the \nasset’s true value at the time of acquisition would be consistent with the principle of full \ncompensation; any reduction calculated with reference to an inflated value would "}

I am further instructed that I am not, therefore, \nrequired to opine on whether, as a matter of Ukrainian law, the Bank would be entitled to attribute the value \nof the Transferred Assets in some other way and/or to reduce some other loss. \nC1/1/48\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 49 - Bank’s case are void, and it in any event contains a rule relating to the valuation of assets \nfor the purposes of reducing contractual debt, rather than for reducing tortious loss, \nnevertheless I consider it relevant to consider because the rule that it lays down, when \napplied to the present circumstances (i.e. where the victim of a tortious lending scheme \nattempts to quantify the reduction to its loss caused by its acceptance of assets transferred \nto it in purported repayment of the unlawful loans) in my view produces a result that is \nconsistent with the principle of full compensation.  \n For the avoidance of doubt, the Bank would not be bound by any inflated value for an asset \nstated in a void pledge agreement and/or reflected in the Bank’s transactional data, both \nbecause the agreement, being void, is of no effect, and because any reduction to the Bank’s \nloss by such inflated value would result in the Bank not being fully compensated for its loss.  \n Even if, contrary to the Bank’s case, the pledge agreements pursuant to which assets were \ntransferred to the Bank were to be treated as valid, then I would still consider that the Bank’s \nloss resulting from the Misappropriation should be reduced by the true value of the pledged \nassets that it lawfully retains at the time of their acquisition by the Bank. For the following \nreasons, any inflated valuation of that asset set out in the relevant pledge agreement or \nrecorded in the Bank’s transactional data would fall to be disregarded. \n First, if the Bank was required to reduce its loss resulting from the Misappropriation by any \nsuch inflated value, then that reduction would itself be excessive and the Bank could not be \nsaid to have been fully compensated for its loss.  \n Secondly, such an outcome would also contravene the general principles expressed in the \nCivil Code of justice, reasonableness and fairness (Article 3("}

As I have explained \nat paragraphs 81 to 88 above, the abuse of rights rule is wide-ranging in its application and \nhas been applied in a number of cases to defeat reliance upon a transaction entered into \nwith the intent and/or effect of making assets unavailable to creditors. In my view, the abuse \nof rights rule can be applied when transactions are entered into to harm creditors’ interests \nin other ways, such as (in the context of the Bank’s claims) giving a false impression that \nvaluable security had been provided for the Relevant/Intermediary Loans, to facilitate the \nC1/1/49\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 50 - Misappropriation and/or to conceal the harm caused to the Bank by the Misappropriation. \nConsequently, I consider that the Bank would be able to invoke the abuse of rights rule to \novercome any reliance placed upon any artificially inflated asset valuations. \n Fourthly, such a result would also be inconsistent with the Bank’s obligation as a matter of \nUkrainian law, pursuant to applicable NBU regulations, to value each pledged asset taken \non to its books at no more than its “ fair market value ” at the time of acquisition. In this regard, \nI refer to: \nArticle 37(5) of the Law of Mortgages, noted above: “ the mortgagee acquires \nownership of the subject of the mortgage at the value determined at the time of such \nacquisition on the basis of the assessment of the subject of the mortgage by the \nsubject of appraisal activity ”; and \nthe following two NBU regulations, which during the relevant period required banks \nto value pledged assets at no more than their fair market value: \nNBU Resolution No. 23 dated 25 January 2012, which approved a \n“Regulation on the procedure for forming and using reserves by banks of \nUkraine for compensation of possible losses on active banking operations” \n(“Regulation 23 ”), in force from 5 March 2012 to 3 January 2017; and \nNBU Resolution No. 351 dated 30 June 2016, which approved a “Regulation \nfor measuring credit risk on bank asset operations by banks of Ukraine” \n(“Regulation 351 ”), in force from 5 July 2016 to the present48.  \n Section II, Chapter 4 of Regulation 23 was entitled “Criteria and Conditions for Accepting \nCollateral for Credit Operations during the Calculation of the Reserve”.

During this transitional period, banks were obliged to (i) develop \ninternal procedures regarding the determination of credit risk in accordance with the requirements of \nRegulation 351, and (ii) calculate the amount of credit risk (in ‘test mode’) and inform the NBU of the same \nin accordance with the terms of Regulation 351.

Furthermore, to the extent that an inflated value \non the Bank’s books derives from (and mirrors) the value appearing in the relevant pledge \nagreement, for the reasons set out my response to question E8 below I do not consider that \nthe Bank would be taken to have affirmed this value, such that it could not later be \nchallenged. \nb) the Bank sells or leases an asset it has lawfully retained to a third party in return \nfor payments (ie of the sale price or lease payments) that were funded by other \nloans granted by the Bank that were (i) procured by the First and Second \nDefendants, (ii) intended to conceal the Bank’s loss arising as a result of the \nMisrepresentation, and (iii) void? \n As I have noted above, the quantification of the Bank’s loss resulting from the \nMisappropriation, including any reduction to that loss in the posited scenario, would fall to \nbe assessed as a matter of fact with reference to Article 22 of the Civil Code, including the \n50  Paragraph 107(5) of Regulation 351 came into effect on 5 May 2018. \nC1/1/53\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 54 - principle that the Bank is entitled to full compensation for its loss caused by the Defendants’ \ntortious conduct (Articles 1161(1), 1192(1) and 22(3) of the Civil Code).  \n In relation to any retained asset later sold or leased by the Bank, to the extent that the \npayments received by the Bank in return (as payments or purchase price or rental payments) \nare referable to other void loans as described in the question, then for the reasons I have \nexplained in response to question E6(f) above, I do not consider that the Bank’s overall loss \nas a result of the Misappropriation should be reduced by the amount of those payments.  \nc) the Bank sells an asset it has lawfully retained to a third party in return for \npayments that are funded from a bona fide source and not as described in (b) \nabove? \n Again, any reduction to the Bank’s loss resulting from the Misappropriation in the posited \nscenario would fall to be quantified as a matter of fact with reference to Article 22 of the Civil \nCode, including the principle that the Bank is entitled to full compensation for its loss caused \nby the Defendants’ tortious conduct (Articles 1161(1), 1192(1) and 22(3) of the Civil Code).  \n Whilst I have stated in response to (a) above that in relation to any lawfully retained but un-\nsold asset (i.e. an asset still held by the Bank), the asset’s true value at the time of its \nacquisition would appear to be the appropriate measure by which to reduce the Bank’s loss, \nI consider that where such an asset has been sold, the net proceeds of sale would naturally \nbe a relevant factor to take into account. The sale price would not, however, necessarily be \ndeterminative and would need to be considered in light of market or other factors that could \nresult in an increase or decrease in the asset’s value between the time of its acquisition and \nsale by the Bank (for example, if the Bank had spent money to increase its value, or had \nallowed the asset to fall into disrepair).  \n Even if, contrary to the Bank’s case, the pledges in question are treated as valid \nnotwithstanding that the Bank succeeds on its claims, then the following rules governing the \nvaluation of pledged assets (albeit for the purpose of crediting such value against secured \ndebt, rather than reducing tortious loss) would in my view be relevant to consider, and they \nalso point to the net sale proceeds of an asset being relevant when determining the \nappropriate reduction to the Bank’s loss resulting from the Misappropriation. \n First, in the con"}

Where a mortgagee forecloses by way of sale of a pledged asset (rather \nthan by taking possession of the asset and potentially selling it at a later date), the underlying \ndebt is reduced by the actual proceeds of sale, with any shortfall remaining recoverable from \nthe debtor and any excess to be returned to the debtor (Article 24 and 25 of the Law on \nPledges; Articles 38(7), 47(7) of the Law on Mortgages).  \n Secondly, as noted above, under Article 37(5) of the Law on Mortgages, a mortgagee taking \npossession of mortgaged property in satisfaction of a debt and in lieu of sale, pursuant to an \nagreement with the mortgagor, does so at the asset’s value determined at the time of its \nacquisition, with such value to be no higher than fair market value (as per Regulation 23 or \n351 discussed above). But where the fair market value of an asset, albeit as at a later date, \nhas been ascertained by way of the mortgagee’s subsequent sale of that asset (by way of \nauction or other appropriate sale process), then in my view the asset’s sale price will be \nrelevant to consider as evidence of the fair market value of the property at the time of its \nacquisition by the mortgagee, subject to consideration of market or other factors apparent \nto explain any increase or decrease in value. \nd) the Bank leases such an asset to a third party in return for payments that are \nfunded from a bona fide source and not as described in (b) above? \n In the posited scenario, in accordance with what I have said in response to (a) above, the \nBank’s loss resulting from the Misappropriation would be reduced by the true value of the \nleased asset at the time of its acquisition by the Bank. In addition, I consider that the Bank \nwould have to reduce its loss by any rental income (derived from bona fide sources) that it \nreceives from the leased asset, less its associated costs. \nE8. In what circumstances would the Bank be considered under Ukrainian law to have \naffirmed or ratified such an asset pledge agreement such that it could no longer \nassert that the agreement is void or voidable? \n Under Ukrainian law, the issue of the validity or invalidity of an agreement is separate to and \nunaffected by its performance51. Therefore, the performance and/or termination of an \n51  For completeness, I note that under Article 241 of the Civil Code, performance of an agreement arguably \ncan have retrospective effect on the rights and obligations arising thereunder, but only in specific \ncircumstances that are irrelevant to the present proceedings. In particular, Article 241 provides, in \nsummary, that where person A’s representative enters a transaction in excess of that representative’s \nauthority, the transaction will only effect A’s rights and obligations if A subsequently approves it. If A does \nso, then A’s rights and obligations will be effected as from the moment of the transaction.

So, for \nexample, the fact that the Bank (i) accepted transfers of assets to it under certain purported \npledge agreements, and (ii) subsequently sold or leased those assets, would not preclude \nthe Bank from later demonstrating the invalidity of those pledge agreements in accordance \nwith law.  \n The above has been confirmed by the Supreme Court. See for example the Resolution of \nthe Supreme Court dated 27 November 2018 in case No. 905/1227/17, The head of the \nMariupol local prosecutor’s office No. 2 Donetsk region in the interests of the State \nrepresented by the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine v. Regional branch of the \nState Property Fund of Ukraine in Donetsk region and Technotron Firm LLC . In that case, \nthe prosecutor asked the court to invalidate a lease agreement between the defendants \nbecause, in breach of law, a school’s real estate was leased to carry out activity that was \nunrelated to the educational process. The defendants stated inter alia  that the real estate in \nquestion had already been returned and there was no longer any lease in place to invalidate. \nNevertheless, the court ruled to invalidate the lease agreement, stating: “The termination of \nan agreement by the parties executed in whole or in part does not deprive the parties of the \nright to apply to the court with a claim to invalidate such an agreement”.52\n Notwithstanding the above, I consider that in an appropriate case, it would be open to a \ncourt to exercise its discretion to refuse a claimant’s request to invalidate a voidable \nagreement if it were to find that such invalidation would amount to an abuse of rights (see \nfurther my discussion of this rule at paragraphs 81 to 88 above). I do not consider, however, \nthat where a claimant satisfies the court that an agreement is void (as opposed to voidable), \nthat a Ukrainian court would apply the abuse of rights rule so as to uphold that void \nagreement (although, as I have explained in response to question E7, I consider that in an \nappropriate case the abuse of rights rule could be applied to prevent a party that transferred \nproperty under a void agreement from relying upon their right to restitution of that property \nunder Article 216(1) of the Civil Code). \n52  The same is supported by the Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 19 August 2020, in the case No. \n665/1836/17, Vodoliy AJSC v.

In what circumstances can a defence of absence of fault apply to a claim under Article \n1166? \n Fault is a separate element of the general tort liability that may take the form of intent or \nnegligence (Article 614(1) of the Civil Code). The Supreme Court has explained this as \nfollows: \n“The Ukrainian Civil Code contains no definition of ‘fault.’ Yet, certain Articles of the Code \nrefer to intent and negligence. Accordingly, civil law traditionally distinguishes between \nintentional and negligent forms of fault. \n49. Article 614(1) of the Ukrainian Civil Code specifies that a person that has breached his \nobligation incurs liability in the case of fault (intent or negligence), unless otherwise provided \nby contract or law.

Article 614(1) of the Ukrainian Civil Code specifies that a person that has breached his \nobligation incurs liability in the case of fault (intent or negligence), unless otherwise provided \nby contract or law. A person is at fault unless such person proves that he has used all \nreasonable endeavours to perform his obligation properly. Applying Article 614 of the \nUkrainian Civil Code to tort relationships by analogy, fault is a person’s failure to use all \nreasonable endeavours to prevent harm (‘behavioural concept of fault’). \n50. Intent, as a form of fault, includes the element of consciousness and wilfulness. A person \nis considered to have acted intentionally where such person understood the unlawful nature \nof own conduct and wanted or consciously permitted the harm (damages) to arise. \n51. Fault in the form of negligence will exist if a person has no intention to cause the harm. \nIn the case of negligence, a person did not foresee the harmful consequences of his act, \nalthough he could foresee, and should have foreseen, them, or was careless (unreasonable) \nto expect that they would be escaped”.53\n Under Ukrainian law, fault is presumed in respect of unlawful conduct that causes harm. \nThus Articles 614(2) and 1166(2) provide that the burden of proof for establishing lack of \nfault lies with the defendant, as recognised by the Supreme Court: \n“As a general rule, tort liability occurs only through the fault of the tortfeasor (intent or \nnegligence). … In other words, civil law provides for the presumption of fault in respect of \ntort obligations. If such presumption is not refuted in the course of the trial, it is legal grounds \nfor a conclusion that the tortfeasor is at fault. Thus, a tortfeasor must prove that the harm \nwas due to no fault of his. If such presumption is not refuted in the course of the trial, it is \nlegal grounds for a conclusion that the tortfeasor is at fault. The claimant is to prove only the \nfacts on which he relies as grounds for his claims”.54\n Given the above, where a person’s unlawful conduct causes harm to another, the tortfeasor \nwill not be held liable for that harm if he proves to the court that he undertook all reasonable \n53  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 24 February 2021, case No. 904/982/19, LLC “Agrocenter-Ukraine” \nin the interests of LLC Agricultural firm “Agrostar” v.

When will the knowledge of a natural person be attributed to a company under \nUkrainian law? In particular, is the fact that a natural person is the ultimate owner or \ncontroller of a company sufficient to impute that person’s knowledge to the \ncompany? \n Ukrainian law distinguishes between two kinds of knowledge: (i) ‘actual knowledge’ (what a \nperson directly knows), and (ii) ‘constructive knowledge’ (what a person objectively should \nhave known) (Article 261 of the Civil Code). The further category of ‘imputed knowledge’, \nbeing (as I understand it) knowledge that will be attributed to a person on the basis of their \nrelationship with another person who has actual or constructive knowledge of relevant facts, \nis not known to Ukrainian law. \n Ukrainian law does not, therefore, have developed rules as regards imputing (attributing) \nthe knowledge of a natural person to a company.

Given this, in my view a Ukrainian court \nwould likely take a common sense approach to determining how and under what \ncircumstances the knowledge of a natural person associated with a company will be \nattributed to that company. This would, in my view, entail the court considering all the specific \ncircumstances of the case to determine whether, as a matter of fact, the company should \nbe found to have the knowledge that a particular natural person has been found to have. \n In this regard, I consider that a Ukrainian court would likely place significant weight upon the \ndegree to which the person whose knowledge is sought to be attributed to a company was \nin a position to exercise influence over the management or business of the company, \nwhether through formal or informal means.  \n In the context of a bank, prima facie those in a position to exercise such influence would in \nmy view likely include any individual who qualifies as: \n an ‘executive’ (or ‘manager’) of the bank within the meaning of Article 42 of the Law on \nBanks (which I discuss in response to question F1 below); \n an ‘officer’ (or ‘official’) of the bank within the meaning of Article 2(1)(15) of the JSC Law \n(which I also discuss in response to question F1 below);  \n the owner of a ‘significant participation’ in the bank within the meaning of Article 2 of \nthe Law on Banks (which I discuss in response to question K1 below);  \nC1/1/58\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 59 -  a ‘controller’ of the bank within the meaning of Article 2 of the Law on Banks (which I \nalso discuss in response to question K1 below); and/or \n an ‘ultimate beneficial owner (controller)’ of the bank within the meaning of the Law on \nAnti-Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Weapons of Mass Destruction \nProliferation Financing of 14 October 2014 (which I discuss in response to question K3 \nbelow). \n In my view, it is likely that a court would also take into account whether the person actually \ndid, in fact, exercise influence over the company’s affairs, rather than merely being in a \nposition to do so, however I am aware of one case that suggests otherwise. \n The case Person 2 v. Nikolitsa et al55, is interesting to consider because it concerned an \nattribution of knowledge ‘in reverse’, i.e. from a company to a person associated with that \ncompany. The case concerned a property (café) that was jointly owned by husband and wife \nand mortgaged by the husband as collateral for a loan he took from JSCIB “UkrSibbank”. \nThe husband and wife then divorced and, some years later, he died. Under Ukrainian family \nlaw, the wife remained entitled to a share in the property, but after the bank’s rights as \nmortgagee (and creditor of the husband) were assigned to LLC Financial company “Pozyka” \n(“Pozyka ”), Pozyka succeeded in becoming the property’s registered owner. Then, after the \nwife (Person 2) had commenced proceedings seeking recognition of her rights to the \nproperty, Pozyka sold the property to its 93% indirect shareholder56, Person 1. On appeal \nfrom a judgment upholding Person 2’s claim, the Kyiv Court of Appeal found that Pozyka \nwas a mala fides  acquirer of the property and that it had sold the property to Person 1, after \nPerson 2 commenced her claim, in order to avoid the property being lost. The Court of \nAppeal attributed Pozyka’s knowledge of these matters to Person 1 on the basis of his status \nas Pozyka’s ultimate beneficial owner and controller, despite the court not making any \nfinding that Person 1 in fact exercised influence over Pozyka’s affairs.  \n Knowledge of a person acting contrary to a company’s inte"}

The knowledge of such a person \nwould not, in my view, be attributed to a company so as to defeat the company’s interests. \nFor example, I consider in section I below, in relation to the topic of limitation, a case where \na company was defrauded by its manager but the Ukrainian appellate court refused to \nattribute that manager’s knowledge to the company for purposes of limitation.  \nE11. What remedies are available for claims under Article 1166? \n Since a claim in tort is a claim seeking compensation for harm already inflicted, the usual \nremedies available under Ukrainian law are: \n compensation in kind (such as an order to replace the damaged property with property \nof like kind, or to repair damaged property); and/or  \n damages in full (Article 1192 of the Civil Code). \n The general rules on damages are found at Article 22 of the Civil Code, quoted at paragraph \n108 above. As noted thereunder, Ukrainian law provides that the breach of a person’s rights \nentitles that person to full compensation for their loss caused by such breach, which concept \nexpressly includes, under Article 22, both actual damage and loss of profit. \nE12. In what circumstances can joint and several liability be imposed upon two or more \npersons pursuant to Article 1190 of the Ukrainian Civil Code (“Article 1190”)?  \n Article 1190 of the Civil Code provides: \n“1. Persons by whose joint actions or failure to act harm was caused shall bear joint and \nseveral responsibility to the victim. \n2. Upon the application of the victim, a court may determine the responsibility of the \npersons who jointly caused harm in a participatory share in accordance with the degree of \ntheir fault”.\n Accordingly, where harm is caused by the joint actions or omissions of two or more persons, \nthe default position is that those persons will be jointly and severally liable for the harm \n(Article 1190(1)). So, for example, where a person committing an unlawful act, which causes \nharm, does so at the behest of another, the procurer, who will also be regarded as having \ncommitted an unlawful act if the act of procurement was taken with an intent to cause that \nharm, will bear joint and several liability for the harm.  \nC1/1/60\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 61 -  In 1992, the Plenary Supreme Court issued the following guidance on the application of \nArticle 1190 of the Civil Code57: \n“... harm caused by action of several persons shall be compensated by each of them in \nproportion to the harm caused (in the order of partial liability).58\nPersons who jointly cause harm, meaning indivisible harm caused by interconnected, \ncumulative actions or actions with unity of intent shall be jointly and"}

Ternopil City Council Technical Supervision Department and \nTernopil City Council Department of Housing and Communal Services, Landscaping and \nEcology , described Article 1190 as follows: \n“Persons who have jointly caused harm, i.e. those who have inflicted indivisible harm by \ninterconnected, cumulative actions, or actions with unity of intent, bear joint responsibility to \nthe injured party. … Under Article 1190 of the Civil Code, persons whose collective actions \nor omissions have caused harm are jointly and severally liable to the injured party. A court \nmay, based on a complaint of the injured party, determine the liability of the joint tortfeasors \nin proportion to the degree of their fault. \nFor the purposes of the legal provision mentioned above, joint tort is considered an \nindivisible outcome of actions or omissions by two or more persons. Actions or omissions \nthat caused harm to others do not have to coincide in time. This rule covers events where it \nis impossible to determine what, and to what extent, action led to that consequence. \nCausing harm through joint actions includes the unity of the tortfeasors’ actions that involves \ntheir being interconnected so that leaving at least one of those actions out of the group of \nthe joint tortfeasors’ acts would not result in the joint tortious outcome. A court may, based \non a complaint of the injured party, determine the liability of the joint tortfeasors in proportion \nto the degree of their fault” .\n Consistent with the Supreme Court’s guidance, I consider the effect of Article 1190 to be \nthat where separate actions (or omissions) are taken by separate persons, including actions \nthat are separated in time (i.e. ‘cumulative’ actions), the harm caused by those actions taken \ntogether can be regarded as a single (indivisible) harm, for which those persons will be jointly \n57 Resolution of the Plenary Supreme Court of Ukraine No. 6 dated 27 March 1992 On Court Practice in Tort \nClaims.\n58  I understand the first part of this guidance to mean that where separate persons together cause harm, their \nliability for that harm will be proportionate to the percentage of the total harm that each of them is found to \nhave caused, where partial liability has been ordered (on the victim’s application), i.e. pursuant to Article \n1190(2) of the Civil Code. \nC1/1/61\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 62 - and severally liable, provided that their separate actions are (i) interconnected, (ii) \ncumulative (which I understand in the sense of one person’s actions building upon, \ndeveloping or progressing the actions of another), and/or (iii) motivated by the same intent59. \n Case No. 753/21343/14-ts, PJSC Ukrsibbank v.

An \neighth defendant, Person 8, a bank employee, was not convicted of any such crime, but was \ninstead convicted under Article 197 of the Criminal Code for causing severe consequences \nto the bank by improperly performing her duties to the bank. The bank then brought separate \ncivil proceedings against the same eight defendants, alleging commission of a joint tort \npursuant to Articles 1166 and 1190 of the Civil Code. The bank’s claim succeeded, and all \neight defendants were held jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the bank’s loss, \nnotwithstanding the different nature of their respective acts and omissions60.

Must the actions or omissions of each person separately be actionable under Article \n1166 in order for Article 1190 to apply?  \n As explained above, in accordance with the Supreme Court’s guidance on the application \nof Article 1190, separate persons may be held jointly and severally liable for their actions \nthat are “ interconnected, cumulative … or actions with unity of intent ” and cause a single \nindivisible harm.

Persons 1-3 (discussed at paragraph 193). \n60  Although in this case, the defendants’ liability in tort was preceded by a criminal verdict in respect of their \nconduct, as I have explained above in response to question E3(b), this is not a prerequisite for liability \nunder Article 1166 \n61  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 4 June 2021, case No. 753/21343/14-ts.  \nC1/1/62\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 63 - Article 1190 that a separate claim against each of the joint tortfeasors must be capable of \nbeing made out under Article 1166.  \n For example, were each of the joint tortfeasors’ individual actions (or omissions) to be \nconsidered separately, it might be that no causal connection (in the ‘but for’ sense) would \nbe found to exist between the harm suffered by the victim and that particular defendant’s \nactions. This would preclude a claim under Article 1166 against that one person alone for \nwant of causation, but I do not believe that a Ukrainian court would hold Article 1190 to be \nof no application in such a scenario. It would be contrary to the provisions of the Civil Code \npursuant to which the Ukrainian courts will seek to protect the interests of a victim of harm \n(see paragraph 67 above). On the contrary, I believe that Article 1190 allows the court to \nconsider whether the victim has suffered an indivisible harm that has been caused by the \ninterconnected actions, cumulative action and/or actions taken with shared intent, of the joint \ntortfeasors when taken together.

In other words, Article \n1190 can apply even where it is not possible to tell which of the joint tortfeasors’ actions or \nomissions, viewed individually, caused the overall harm.  \n In further support of my view, I would refer to the Supreme Court’s Resolution dated 29 May \n2019 in case No. 740/967/16-ts, Joint stock commercial bank “Kyiv” v. Persons 1-3 . In that \ncase, Article 1190 was applied to impose joint and several liability upon three individuals in \na situation where: \n62  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 8 April 2020, case No. 607/16993/18, Person 1 v. Ternopil City \nCouncil Technical Supervision Department, Ternopil City Council Department of Housing and Communal \nServices, Landscaping and Ecology . \nC1/1/63\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 64 -  the claimant bank had loaned money to Industrial LLC Agro-industrial company \n“Zlahoda” (company A) for the purpose of buying farm machinery from Unit Investment \nCompany LLC (company B); \n the directors of A and B knew that B could not deliver the machinery, which was of a \ntype not produced in Ukraine; \n A paid the funds to B, without any machinery being delivered in return; \n B then paid the money back to A, purportedly as an advance for poppy seeds, which \nalso were not delivered; \n three individuals: A’s director, A’s chief accountant and B’s director were convicted of \nfinancial crimes; and \n the claimant bank then brought a claim in tort.  \n At first instance and on appeal, all three individuals were found to have caused an indivisible \nharm to the bank through their separate but inter-related actions, taken with a shared, \nunlawful intent. B’s director appealed to the Supreme Court on the basis that because he \nwas not employed by A (which took the loan from the bank), there could be no causal \nconnection between his actions and the harm suffered by the bank. In rejecting his \nargument, the Supreme Court emphasised that where harm is caused by several persons, \nArticle 1190 will apply where harm is found to have been caused jointly by their actions or \nomissions: \n“Under general rule [Article 1166] tort liability occurs only if the person who caused the harm \nis guilty (intentionally or negligently). \nThe absence of any such condition is a ground to discharge the person from liability, unless \nother prescribed by law. \nArticle 1190 of Ukrainian Civil Code governs relations with respect to liability for the harm \ncaused by several persons. According to the Article, persons whose joint actions or \nomissions caused harm shall be jointly and severally liable before injured party. \nTaking into account this provision of substantive law, persons who jointly caused indivisible \nharm by their interrelated joint actions or actions with the unity of intent shall be jointly and \nseverally liable before the injured party. \nFor the occurrence of joint and several liability in case of harm caused by a crime committed \nby two or more persons, it is necessary to establish that the actions of the tortfeasors were \nC1/1/64\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 65 - interconnected by joint criminal intent and the inflicted harm was the outcome of their joint \nactions“63. \n As there is no need to show, in the case of a joint tort, that any one tortfeasor’s a"}

Will joint and several liability under Article 1190 be imposed upon joint tortfeasors \nonly when it is not possible to apportion or divide responsibility for harm caused by \nthem? \n As I have explained above, Article 1190 requires the claimant to have suffered an “ indivisible \nharm ” and I consider this to be a necessary element for the imposition of joint and several \nliability upon joint tortfeasors under that Article.  \n The term “ indivisible harm ” has not been directly explained in legislation or case law (as far \nas I am aware), but in my view the term should be understood to refer to harm that has been \ncaused by the joint tortfeasors’ conduct when considered as a whole (provided that such \nconduct consisted of actions and/or omissions that were interconnected, cumulative or taken \nwith unity of intent). The harm suffered by a claimant would not, in my view, be found to be \nindivisible if it were possible for the court to find that each of the alleged joint tortfeasors had \ncaused (in the ‘but for’ sense) a distinct and separate part of that harm that no other one or \nmore of the alleged joint tortfeasors could be said to have contributed to causing. In such a \nscenario, each tortfeasor would be liable for the harm it had caused.  \n63  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 29 May 2019, case No. 740/967/16-ts, PJSC “Joint-stock \ncommercial bank “Kyiv” v.

LIABILITY FOR BREACH OFSPECIFIC DUTIES RELATING TOBANKS \nF1. What specific duties does Ukrainian law impose upon individuals of authority within \na bank?  \n Under Ukrainian law, individuals who exercise certain authority or control within a bank are \nsubject to three layers of specific duties imposed by the following statutes:  \n the Civil Code, which imposes duties upon certain individuals within legal entities \ngenerally, including banks;  \nC1/1/66\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 67 -  the JSC Law, which imposes duties upon certain individuals within joint-stock \ncompanies, being the form of Ukrainian business that many banks take (including the \nBank); and  \n the Law on Banks, which imposes duties upon certain individuals within banks. \n Although various provisions of the above three statutes state that liability will accrue for \nbreaches of these specific duties (see Article 92(4) of the Civil Code, Article 63(2), (3) of the \nJSC Law and Article 42(20) (formerly 42(11)) of the Law on Banks), such a breach does not \ngive rise to any separate cause of action or to special remedies not ordinarily available in \ntort (such as I understand is the case as regards breaches of fiduciary duty under English \nlaw). Instead, such a breach will constitute unlawful conduct for purposes of a tort claim \nunder Article 1166.  \n These specific duties (which I describe below), are often referred to in the Ukrainian banking \nand legal communities as ‘fiduciary duties’, although they are not formally defined as such \nunder Ukrainian law64. \n Duties under the Civil Code. Article 92 of the Civil Code imposes duties on the members of \na ‘body’ of a legal entity, and any person having the authority to act on behalf of a legal \nentity, to act in good faith, reasonably, in the best interests of that entity, and not ultra vires : \n“Article 92. Civil law capacity of a legal entity \n1. A legal entity acquires civil rights and obligations and exercises them through its \nbodies acting in accordance with its constitutional documents and the law. … \n64  NBU Resolution No. 98, dated 28 March 2007, which approved “Methodological Recommendations on \nImprovement of Corporate Governance in Banks of Ukraine”, described the term ‘fiduciary duty’ as: ‘ ‘… \nthe duty to act in the best interests of another person. The head of a bank (fiduciary) is required to act \ntaking into account the interests of the bank (that is, all its shareholders and clients), and not from personal \n(private) interests. A fiduciary is always required to act in good faith and impartially. The Fiduciary must be \nhonest and must not deal with it in such a way as to give him unrelated benefits or prejudice the interests \nof clients or shareholders ”. In 2018, these Recommendations were replaced by NBU Resolution No. 814-\nrsh, dated 3 December 2018, which approved “Methodical Recommendations for Organisation of \nCorporate Governance in Banks of Ukraine”. The new Recommendations (which remain current), do not \nuse the term ‘fiduciary duty’; instead paragraphs 2(5) and 2(6) thereof provide for a “ duty of care ”, i.e. the \nduty of bank executives to make decision"}

In 2018, these Recommendations were replaced by NBU Resolution No. 814-\nrsh, dated 3 December 2018, which approved “Methodical Recommendations for Organisation of \nCorporate Governance in Banks of Ukraine”. The new Recommendations (which remain current), do not \nuse the term ‘fiduciary duty’; instead paragraphs 2(5) and 2(6) thereof provide for a “ duty of care ”, i.e. the \nduty of bank executives to make decisions and act in the interests of the bank on the basis of a \ncomprehensive assessment of available (provided) information, and a “ duty of loyalty ”, i.e. the duty of bank \nexecutives to act in good faith in the interests of the bank, and not in self-interest, interests of another \nperson or group of persons with prejudice to the interests of the bank. The Supreme Court has confirmed \nthat the NBU’s Recommendations can be used by the courts when assessing whether actions/omissions \nof bank executives breach their statutory duties (see Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 21 July 2021 \nin case No. 910/12930/18, Deposit Guarantee Fund v. Person 1 at al ). \nC1/1/67\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 68 - 3. A body or person who according to the constitutional documents of the legal entity \nor the law acts in the name of the legal entity is obligated to act in the interests of the legal \nentity in good faith and reasonably and not exceed its authority. … \n4. If the members of a body of a legal entity or other persons who, according to the law \nor constitutional documents act in the name of the legal entity, breach their obligations \nconcerning their representation, they shall be jointly and severally liable for losses that they \ncause to the legal entity”. \n The ‘bodies’ of a legal entity will vary according to its type and constitutional documents, and \nin the case of a bank would include its supervisory board, management board and audit \ncommission, and so all members of those bodies would owe the duties set out above (in \naddition to the specific duties arising under the JSC Law and Law on Banks, as addressed \nbelow).  \n Where a person is vested by way of a power of attorney, made in accordance with law, with \nthe authority to act in the name of a legal entity, then in my view that person will also owe \nthe above duties under Article 92. In any event, the holder of a power of attorney will owe \nduties to act in good faith, reasonably and within their authority under Articles 237(1), (3) \nand 238(1), (3) of the Civil Code65. \n In case No. 910/11027/18, Ukoopspilka Joint-Stock Bank PJSC v. Person 1 et al (discussed \nat paragraph 74 above), the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court stated the following as \nregards the application of Article 92: \n7.14. In its resolution dated December 4, 2018 in case No. 910/21493/17, the Supreme \nCourt, as part of the panel of judges of the Commercial Court of Cassation, indicated the \nfollowing. According to the requirements of Article 92 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, persons \nacting on behalf of a legal entity are obliged to act only within the limits of their powers, but \nalso in good faith and reasonably. Taking into account the provisions of the cited legal norm \nand the trusting nature of the relationship between a legal entity and its official (in particular, \na director or general director), the unlawful behaviour of an official can be expressed not \nonly in its failure to fulfil obligations directly established by the constituent documents of the \ncompany, or in excess of powers when performing certain actions on behalf of the company, \nbut also in improper and dishonest performance of such actions without observing the \nboundaries of normal economic risk, with personal interest or abuse of discretion, making \nobviously rash or wasteful decisions. Similar conclusions were made in the judgment of the \nGrand Chamber of the Supreme Court of October 22, 2019 in case No. 911/2129/17. …"}

Thus, when applying Article 92 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, it is necessary to assess \nnot only the formal side of the issue - the official’s compliance with all provisions of the \nlegislation, the charter, decisions of the general meeting of participants / shareholders, and \nthe like. After all, even when an official has formally fulfilled all the requirements of the \nlegislation and the constituent documents of the company, his actions (omissions) may not \nbe conscientious, reasonable and committed in the interests of the legal entity. \n Duties under the JSC Law. The JSC Law imposes duties on all ‘officers’ (which may also be \ntranslated as ‘officials’) of a joint-stock company’s bodies. Under Article 2(1)(15) of the JSC \nLaw, these officers include members of the company’s supervisory board, members of its \nmanagement board, members of its audit commission, the company’s internal auditor, and \nmembers of any other body provided for in the company’s charter. \n Article 63 of the JSC Law imposes the following duties: \n“Article 63. Liability of the officers of a joint stock company’s bodies \n1. The officers of a joint stock company’s bodies shall act in the interests of the \ncompany, follow the requirements of the law, provisions of the charter and other documents \nof the company. \n2. The officers of a joint stock company’s bodies are liable to the company for losses \ncaused to the company by their actions (omissions) in accordance with the law. \n3. In the event that several persons are liable in accordance with this article, their \nliability to the company shall be joint and several”. \n Thus, the JSC Law mirrors the duty under Article 92(3) of the Civil Code to act in the \ncompany’s best interests, and imposes further duties on officers to follow the requirements \nof the law, provisions of the company’s charter and “other documents of the company” . \nThese ‘other documents’ comprise those that set down rules or procedures that are \nconsidered within a particular company to be binding, and so may differ from company to \ncompany. In the Bank’s case, I consider that this would include ( inter alia )the Bank’s \nsupervisory board regulations, management board regulations, regulations of the general \nmeeting of shareholders, credit committee regulations and Lending Procedures Manual in \nforce from time to time (all of which I have been provided with and reviewed).  \n Article 51 of the JSC Law imposes further, and different, duties on the members of a \ncompany’s supervisory board as regards non-delegation of duty: \nC1/1/69\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 70 -  Article 51(1) (version in effect from 30 April 2011 to 16 November 2017) provided: “ The \nSupervisory Board of a joint-stock company is a body that protects the rights of the \ncompany’s shareholders and, within the competence defined by the Charter and this \nLaw, controls and regulates the activities of the executive body ”66;  \n Article 51(4) (version in effect from 2 March 2011 to 30 April 2016) provided: “ A member \nof the supervisory board must perform his duties personally "}

This exception permitted a member of a supervisory board that was a \nlegal entity to delegate its authority to a representative, but otherwise pursuant to this \nArticle members of a company’s supervisory board owed a positive duty to exercise \nthemselves, and not delegate, the authority granted to them under the JSC Law and \nthe company’s charter67.

Whereas the JSC Law imposes duties on ‘officers’ of a \njoint-stock company’s bodies, the Law on Banks imposes duties on the Bank’s ‘executives’ \n(which can also be translated as ‘managers’). \n Under Article 42 of the Law on Banks, a bank’s executives are defined as the chairman, his \ndeputies and members of the bank’s supervisory board, the chairman, his deputies and \nmembers of the bank’s board of directors, and the chief accountant. Prior to 6 January 2018, \na bank’s executives also included executives of the bank’s subdivisions. Prior to 5 August \n2021, a bank’s executives also included any deputy of the chief accountant. \n Since 10 January 2015, Article 42 of the Law on Banks has imposed duties upon a bank’s \nexecutives that mirror those imposed by Article 63 of the JSC Law on a company’s officers75: \n“The executives of a bank are obligated to act in the bank’s interests and to observe the \nrequirements of the law, the provisions of [the bank’s] charter and other documents of the \nbank. … \nThe executives of a bank shall be liable to the bank for harm caused to the bank by their \nactions and omissions in accordance with the law.

Since 6 August 2021, these duties are now found at Articles 42(19) and (20) of the Law \non Banks. \nC1/1/72\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 73 - have been found at Articles 42(19) and (20) of the Law on Banks. These duties have not \napplied retrospectively, however, meaning that conduct prior to 10 January 2015 could not \nhave constituted a breach of these duties (although it could have constituted a breach of \nduty under other provisions then in effect, as addressed above and below). \n In addition, Article 43 of the Law on Banks, which has been in effect since 17 January 2001, \nimposes duties beyond those imposed by the Civil Code or JSC Law, as follows: \n“Article 43. Duty to protect the bank’s interests \nThe executives of a bank are obligated to act for the benefit of the bank and its clients and \nare obligated to place the interests of the bank above their own when performing their \nobligations in accordance with the requirements of this Law. \nIn particular, the bank’s executives are required: \n1. to behave responsibly when performing the duties of their office; \n2. to take decisions within the bounds of the powers given to them; \n3. to refrain from using their office in their personal interests; \n4. to secure the integrity and transfer of the bank’s property and documents when \nexecutives are dismissed from their office ”76.\n In sum, the duties of a bank’s executives go beyond the general duty in tort to refrain from \nintentionally or negligently causing harm, and go beyond the duties of a company’s officers \nto act reasonably, in good faith, in the interests of a company and in accordance with law \nand the company’s "}

Bank executives are also under a positive \nduty to behave responsibly, act for the benefit of the bank and its clients, place the bank’s \ninterests above their own, and refrain from using their office in their personal interests77. \nThey also owe these duties not only to the bank, but to the bank’s clients. \n Members of the Bank’s Supervisory Board qualified as both executives and officers of the \nBank, and as such, would act in breach of Article 92 of the Civil Code, Article 63(1) of the \nJSC Law, and Articles 43 and (after 5 January 2015) Article 42 of the Law on Banks, if by \nact or omission they: \n76  This fourth requirement was added to Article 43 on 5 August 2009. \n77  This would include, in my view, where a bank executive uses their office to further a third party’s interests, \nprovided that the bank executive has a personal interest in that third party’s interests being satisfied.  \nC1/1/73\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 74 -  failed to comply with the Bank’s Charter or Supervisory Board regulations (including, \nfor example, by authorising or failing to prevent loans over USD 500,000 to a related \nparty of the Bank), or otherwise with applicable law;  \n acted for their own personal gain or that of their affiliates or related parties; and/or  \n failed to act in the best interests of the Bank and/or in good faith and/or caused the \nBank to enter into agreements which were contrary to law or not in its best interests.  \n For the avoidance of doubt, any instance of such conduct would constitute unlawful conduct \nfor purposes of a tort claim under Article 1166. \n Risky activity. In determining whether actions taken by a bank as a result of its executives’ \ndecisions are in the bank’s best interests or contrary to law, I consider that any rule setting \nbehavioural standards for banks, as well as that’s banks own internal rules, will be relevant \nto take into account. In addition to the rules I have discussed in this section, and in response \nto questions D4 (related party lending) and D5 (unauthorised significant transactions) above, \nfor example, I consider that the following rules regarding risky activity also would be relevant \nto take into account: \n Article 49(6) of the Law on Banks provides: “ In the course of extending loans, the bank \nshall observe the fundamental principles of lending, including verification of the \nborrowers’ creditworthiness and the availability of security, shall observe the \nrequirements of the National Bank of Ukraine in respect of the concentration of risks ”; \n Article 73(1) of the Law on Banks provides that “ conducting risky operations, which \nthreaten the interests of the depositors or other creditors of the bank ” is a violation which \nmay lead to the NBU imposing measures of influence (sanctions) upon the bank; and \n since 12 August 2015, Article 48(1) of the Law on Banks has stated: “ banks are \nprohibited from engaging in risky activity, which threatens the interests of the depositors \nand other creditors of the bank ”. \n According to Article 48 (1) of the Law on Banks, the core indicator of risky activity is threat \nto the interest of a bank’s depositors and other creditors. Paragraph 3.3 of Section I of NBU \nBoard Resolution No. 346 of 17 August 2012 approving a “Regulation on the Application of \nC1/1/74\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 75 - Measures of Influence by the National Bank of Ukraine”78 lists numerous i"}

Paragraph 3.3 of Section I of NBU \nBoard Resolution No. 346 of 17 August 2012 approving a “Regulation on the Application of \nC1/1/74\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 75 - Measures of Influence by the National Bank of Ukraine”78 lists numerous indicia of risky \nactivity including, in the sphere of financial monitoring: \n“carrying out financial transactions by the bank clients that do not have documentary \nevidence of obvious economic feasibility (meaning) and/or if the bank does not have \ndocuments (information) on the real financial capabilities of clients’ financial transactions, or \nin case of non-compliance of the client’s financial transactions with the documents \n(information) available in the bank regarding the financial condition and/or content of the \nclient’s activities (social status) ”;\n“carrying out financial transactions by the bank or clients of the bank, the nature or \nconsequences of which give reason to believe that they may be associated with the \navoidance of compliance with the requirements and restrictions provided for by banking, \ncurrency legislation, legislation on financial monitoring ”;and \n“repeated carrying out by the bank client of the financial transactions for the transfer of funds \nabroad as making advance payments (advance payment) for the performance of the foreign \neconomic agreement(s) in respect of which the bank knew or could have known, in particular \nfrom public sources or from other financial institutions that the counterparty(s) repeatedly \nviolates the fulfilment/ does not fulfil the terms of the relevant foreign economic \nagreement(s) ”. \nF2. Can the specific duties identified in response to question F1 be breached by \nomissions as well as by actions? \n In my view, breach of the specific duties discussed in response to the previous question can \noccur by way of omission as well as action. \n Many of the Articles referred to above describe duties to take some “action” or “act”, for \nexample, Article 92(3) of the Civil Code, Articles 51(1) and 63(1) of the JSC Law, Article \n42(19) of the Law on Banks, and Article 43 of the Law on Banks. Where a duty exists to take \nsome action or act, in my view it follows naturally that a failure to take such action or act (i.e. \nan omission) will breach that duty. \n Furthermore: \n Article 610 of the Civil Code expressly provides that an obligation is breached when it \nis not performed or performed in violation of the conditions specified in the content of \nthe obligation (i.e. performed improperly);  \n78  Version in effect from 4 August 2016 to 9 October 2020. \nC1/1/75\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 76 -  Article 63(2) of the JSC Law expressly provides that the officers of a joint stock \ncompany’s bodies are liable to the company for losses caused to the company by their \nactions or omissions; and \n Article 42(20) of the Law on Banks expressly provides that the executives of a bank \nshall be liable to the bank for harm caused to the bank by their actions as well as their \nomissions. \n The Resolution of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court dated 25 May 2021 in case \nNo. 910/11027/18, Ukoopspilka Joint-Stock Bank PJSC v.

The [defendants]79 as managers of the bank with the appropriate degree of \nqualification and experience knew or should have known about the systematic withdrawal \nof assets from the bank during 2014 by concluding bond purchase and sale agreements. \nThe defendants did not provide any evidence or arguments for taking active action to prevent \nthis process. \n7.76. Thus, the insolvency of the bank is a consequence of both their active actions \n(decision-making, signing agreements aimed at buying bonds) and passive inaction. It does \nnot matter for what amount and what contracts of sale agreed or signed by each of the \ndefendants”. \nF3. Where a person’s conduct amounts to a breach of both Article 63 of the JSC Law and \nArticles 42 or 43 of the Law on Banks, are the latter provisions only applicable (as lex \nspecialis )? \n The Law on Banks is rightly regarded as lex specialis in relation to the JSC Law. Where a \nprovision of the JSC Law contradicts a provision of the Law on Banks, the provision of the \nLaw on Banks will prevail to the extent of that contradiction.  \n To be clear, I do not believe that the Law on Banks alone would apply in the event of an \noverlap in content between that Law and the JSC Law; in many areas, including in relation \nto the specific duties considered above, the two Laws overlap but do not contradict one \n79  The Resolution reads ‘plaintiffs’ but I believe this is a clear typographical error and that the correct word \nshould be ‘defendants’. \nC1/1/76\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 77 - another, and accordingly both may be capable of application. In any event, I am not aware \nof any inconsistency between the Law on Banks and JSC Law that is relevant to the Bank’s \nclaims. \n My opinion in this regard is supported by the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court’s \nResolution in Ukoopspilka Joint-Stock Bank PJSC v. Person 1 et al  (discussed at paragraph \n74 above). There, the defendants, all senior bank executives, were found to have breached \nboth their duties as company officers under Article 63 of the JSC Law and their duties as \nbank executives under Articles 42 and 43 of the Law on Banks80. \nF4. In what circumstances can liability be imposed on a related party of a bank under \nArticle 58 of the Law on Banks? \n Separate to the duties considered in response to question F1 above, which are imposed \nupon certain individuals of authority within a bank, following amendments to the Law on \nBanks in effect from 8 March 2015, Article 58 of the Law on Banks imposes, in certain \nsituations, a special liability upon a bank’s ‘related parties’, which may include those same \nindividuals of authority. \n The current provisions of the Law on Banks that define the persons who are a bank’s ‘related \nparties’ are set out at paragraph 52 above. \n In relation to such related parties, Article 58 of the Law on Banks provides: \n“… Owners of significant participations are obliged to take timely measures to prevent the \nbank from becoming insolvent.  \nA related party of a bank shall incur civil, administrative and criminal liability for violations of \nthe law, including legal acts of the National Bank of Ukraine, for undertaking risky operations \nthreatening the interests of depositors or other creditors of the bank, or for driving the bank \ninto insolvency. \nA related party of a bank whose acts or omissions have caused the bank harm due to his \nfault shall be liable with his own property.

Person 1 et al . \nC1/1/77\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 78 -  Amongst other things, this amended Article 58, by the final paragraph quoted above, \nimposes joint and several liability on any related party of a bank that receives, directly or \nindirectly, a property benefit as a result of the acts or omissions of another of the bank’s \nrelated parties which have caused harm to the bank. As with liability for unjust enrichment, \ndiscussed in the following section, this receipt-based liability requires neither unlawful \nconduct nor fault on the part of the related party that benefited from the first related party’s \nharmful conduct. \nG. LIABILITY INUNJUST ENRICHMENT \nG1. What are the component elements of a claim under Article 1212 of the Ukrainian Civil \nCode (“Article 1212”)?  \n Liability for acquisition or preservation of property without sufficient legal grounds (‘unjust \nenrichment’) is governed by Chapter 83 of the Civil Code. The basic elements are set out at \nArticle 1212 of the Civil Code: \n“Article 1212. General provisions on obligations in connection with the acquisition or \npreservation of property without sufficient legal grounds \n1. A person who has acquired or preserved property at the expense of another person \n(the injured party) without sufficient legal grounds (acquisition of property without grounds) \nshall be obligated to return that property to the injured party. The person is also obligated to \nreturn the property in the event that the ground upon which it was acquired later fell away. \n2. The provisions of this chapter shall apply irrespective of whether the acquisition or \npreservation of property without grounds resulted from the conduct of the acquirer of the \nproperty, the injured party or other parties, or as the result of an event. \n3. The provisions of this chapter shall also apply to claims concerning: \n1) the return of performance under an invalid transaction; \n2) the recovery of property from unlawful possession by its owner; \n3) the return of performance by one of the parties to an obligation; \n4) compensation for harm by a person who unlawfully acquired property or saved it at \nthe expense of another person”. \n Thus, unjust enrichment occurs where the following elements are present: \n one party (the ‘acquirer’) is enriched by acquiring or preserving property; \nC1/1/78\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 79 -  the enrichment occurs at the expense of another party (the ‘injured party’); and \n there are no sufficient legal grounds for the acquirer’s enrichment, or those grounds \nhave fallen away. \n A person may become enriched by: \n the actual acquisition of another’s property or property rights; or  \n preserving or saving his own property at the expense or detriment of another. \n Liability for unjust enrichment is distinguishable from liability in tort in that it requires neither \nunlawful conduct nor fault on the part of the acquirer. An acquirer’s obligation to pay arises \nfrom the fact of his enrichment (i.e. liability is receipt-based), whereas a tortfeasor’s liability \narises from the harm he has caused, irrespective of whether h"}

An acquirer’s obligation to pay arises \nfrom the fact of his enrichment (i.e. liability is receipt-based), whereas a tortfeasor’s liability \narises from the harm he has caused, irrespective of whether he has benefited from the \ninjured party’s loss. \n This cause of action was introduced into Ukrainian law relatively recently, in 2003, and it \nremains a developing area of the law. \nG2. Is money held in and money transferred between bank accounts considered to be \nproperty for the purposes of Article 1212?  \n Yes, for the purposes of Article 1212, property includes money, whether in the form of cash \nor in a bank account.  \n In the Resolution of the Northern Commercial Court of Appeal dated 3 June 2021 in case \nNo. 920/858/18, the appellate court stated: “ The events that may result in the obligations set \nout in Article 1212 of the Ukrainian Civil Code include, without limitation, a money transfer \nto another person who is not contractually related to the payer ”.\n Claims for unjust enrichment have been upheld in cases where the enrichment in question \nconsisted of funds transferred to a defendant’s bank account. See for example the Supreme \nCourt’s Resolution dated 24 July 2019 in case No. 577/1011/16-ts, Person 1 v. Lease \nCompany “Etalon” LLC . There, the claimant applied to the defendant to conclude a financial \nlease agreement. Given the agreement’s length, the claimant did not sign it on the last page, \nintending first to study the agreement in detail. On the same day, however, the claimant \ntransferred UAH 12,800 to the defendant’s bank account. The claimant then sought to \nrecover this sum from the defendant under Article 1212. The Supreme Court concluded: \nC1/1/79\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 80 - “In addition, according to Article 1212 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, a person who has \nacquired or preserved property at the expense of another person (the injured party) without \nsufficient legal grounds (acquisition of property without grounds) shall be obligated to return \nthat property to the injured party. The provisions of this chapter shall apply irrespective of \nwhether the acquisition or preservation of property without grounds resulted from the \nconduct of the acquirer of the property, the injured party or other parties, or as the result of \nan event. \nHaving established that Person 1 paid to the account of Lease Company “Etalon” LLC the \nmonetary funds in the amount of UAH 12 800, but she did not have the will to conclude the \nfinancial lease agreement on the conditions specified in it, and she did not sign the \nmentioned agreement, the court of appeal came to the reasonable conclusion that there \nare legal grounds for satisfying the claim ”. \nG3. Is a person enriched for the purposes of Article 1212 when they receive monies that \nthey: \na) immediately transfer on to a third party? \n Once a person has been enriched within the meaning of Article 1212, it is no defence to an \nunjust enrichment claim that the enrichment has been dissipated, although dissipation may \nbe relevant to the issue of remedy (see my response to question G8 below).  \n I am not aware of any rule of Ukrainian law pursuant to which the length of time that an \nunjust enrichment remains in the hands of a recipient is relevant to determining their liability \nunder Article 1212. Mere receipt (or preservation) of the enrichment will suffice; the \nrequirement is not one of ‘receipt and retention (for some indeterminate time)’. \n As a general proposition, therefore, I consider that where A has been unjustly enriched at \nthe expense of B, B may pursue a cause of action under Article 1212 against A irrespective \nof whether A has subs"}

The length of time between \nA’s receipt of the enrichment and its dissipation to C does not affect the position.  \n I understand that English law provides for a defence of ‘change of position’ to an unjust \nenrichment claim, which may apply where the circumstances of the defendant, after being \nenriched at the claimant’s expense, have changed to the defendant’s detriment due to that \nenrichment such that it would be unjust to require them to give restitution. Ukrainian law \ndiffers in this respect: there is no defence of change of position provided for in the Civil Code \nnor am I aware of any Ukrainian court practice introducing such a defence into Ukrainian \nlaw.  \nC1/1/80\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 81 -  I should also make clear that in the above hypothetical scenario, B also would be able to \npursue an unjust enrichment claim against C, provided that the elements of Article 1212 are \npresent in respect of C’s acquisition of the enrichment. There is no rule of Ukrainian law that \nwould require B to sue one recipient (A or C) over the other, and B could choose which \ninstance of unjust enrichment to sue upon, but would not be permitted ultimately to double \nrecover. \nb) hold to the account of a third party and/or in which that third party holds the \nbeneficial interest? \n Article 1212 of the Civil Code makes clear that an unjust enrichment claim is available \nagainst “ A person who acquired property ... at the expense of another person … without \nsufficient legal grounds …”. . As a general proposition, a person (‘A’) acquires property, and \nso is enriched for purposes of Article 1212, when money is paid into their bank account.  \n As regards the first part of the question, in my view the general proposition above remains \ntrue where the recipient holds the money they have acquired “ to the account of ”a third party \n(‘C’). I understand this to mean that an arrangement exists between A and C for the transfer \nof the money from A to C at some future point. As I have explained in response to question \n(a) above, if A had immediately upon receipt of the money transferred it to C, A would still \nbe regarded as having been enriched and a claim in unjust enrichment could be brought \nagainst them (provided all other elements of the cause of action are present). I do not see \nthat A could be in any better position if they instead hold the enrichment subject to an \narrangement to transfer the money to C at some future time.  \n The second part of the question asks me to consider a situation in which C “ holds the \nbeneficial interest ” in the monies that A receives. Ukrainian law, however, does not divide \nownership into legal and beneficial interests, as I understand is the case in common law \njurisdictions (and so, for example, a trust cannot be created under Ukrainian law), and as I \nhave explained in response to question E6(b) above, the holder of a bank account is \nregarded as the owner of funds in that account. Consistent with this, I am not aware of any \nUkrainian case involving an allegedly unjust receipt of monies into a bank account in which \nthe account holder was not found to be enriched, despite the elements of Article 1212 \notherwise being satisfied. \nC1/1/81\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 82 - G4.

In what circumstances will an enrichment occur “ at the expense of ” a claimant? \n Enrichment that does not come at the expense of the injured party cannot give rise to a claim \nto return or afford compensation for the property. The ‘expense’ suffered by the injured party \nmay be in the form of actual losses or expenditures, or lost profit (‘foregone benefit’81). There \nis no requirement that the acquirer be enriched by acquiring or saving property as a result \nof a contractual or other special relationship with the injured party, the only relevant issue is \nwhether the acquirer’s enrichment has come at the injured party’s expense.  \n In this respect, the Supreme Court has made clear that unjust enrichment requires there to \nbe a causal connection between the defendant’s enrichment and the claimant’s loss:  \n “[unjust enrichment requires] 1) a person’s property has increased (that person has \nacquired new items of value or increased the amount and value of his property or \npreserved the property that should have inevitably left his possession); and 2) another \nperson has lost its property; that is, a person has increased or preserved his property \nas a result of such other person having lost or received less property ”82; and\n “The objective conditions for the emergence of obligations on acquisition or \npreservation of property without a sufficient legal basis are: 1) acquisition or \npreservation of property by one person (acquirer) at the expense of another (victim); 2) \ndamage in the form of reduction or non-increase of property of another person (victim); \n3) causal link between the increase or preservation of property by the acquirer and the \nreduction or absence of increase on the part of the victim; 4) the absence of a legal \nbasis for the specified change in the property status of these persons ”83. \n There is, however, no requirement that the benefit received by the defendant would have \notherwise been received by the claimant. For example, if a person takes water from a stream \npassing through another person’s property, or taps into that other person’s wireless internet \nconnection, without permission, and then goes on to use or sell those resources for their \n81  See for example Resolution of the High Commercial Court dated 17 November 2016, case No. \n922/1255/15, Kharkiv City Council v.

Pursuant to Article 1212, the Bank claims that the Defendant Suppliers are liable to \nreturn their enrichment in kind and/or to compensate the Bank for the total value of \nproperty received in connection with the Misappropriation (USD 1,911,877,385). As a \nmatter of Ukrainian law, is the Bank’s claim affected by any of the following: \na) the Unreturned Prepayments were made to the Defendant Suppliers by the \nBorrowers, not by the Bank (meaning that the funds transferred arguably \nbelonged to the Borrowers, not the Bank)? \n I do not consider this factor to have any effect on the Bank’s unjust enrichment claim.

In \ndetermining whether the Defendant Suppliers’ enrichment was at the Bank’s expense, the \nonly relevant issue is whether there is a causal connection between their enrichment and \nthe Bank’s loss. For this purpose, it does not matter that the Defendant Suppliers did not \nreceive the enrichment in question (the Unreturned Prepayments) directly from the Bank, \nbut were instead enriched as a result of a series of related transactions (the Bank’s case \nbeing that the Relevant Loans to the Borrowers caused the Defendant Suppliers to be paid \nthe Unreturned Prepayments). \n In Kyiv City Council v. Ukrenerhopolis Insurance PJSC and Liberty Plaza LLC , a land plot \nwas sold by Kyiv City Council to Ukrenerhopolis Insurance PJSC, which later sold the same \nland plot to Liberty Plaza LLC. The first sale was declared invalid as contrary to requirements \nof the Land Code, and the second sale was declared invalid as the seller (Ukrenerhopolis \nInsurance PJSC) was not the true owner of the property (due to the first sale having been \ninvalid).

The case illustrates that where property passes \nfrom the claimant to a first acquirer, to a second acquirer, a claim in unjust enrichment can \nbe maintained against the second acquirer84.  \n Although in the above case the property in the hands of the second acquirer was the very \nsame property that was previously in the hands of the claimant, for the reasons identified in \nresponse to the question below, I consider that the same result would follow even if the \nconnection between the defendant’s enrichment and the claimant’s loss was not proprietary.  \n84  See Resolution of the High Commercial Court of Ukraine dated 20 November 2012, case No. 5011 – \n14/5760, Kyiv City Council v. Ukrenerhopolis Insurance PJSC and Liberty Plaza LLC. \nC1/1/83\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 84 - b) the monies received by the Defendant Suppliers were not the same monies (in \nthe proprietary sense) that were transferred by the Bank to the Borrowers? \n The Bank’s claim in unjust enrichment is not a proprietary claim and it is not necessary for \nthe Bank to show that the Defendant Suppliers received any part of the same monies (in the \nproprietary sense) paid by the Bank to the Borrowers. It will be sufficient for the Bank to \nshow that the Defendant Suppliers have acquired or preserved property (i.e. obtained a \nbenefit) at the expense of the Bank. As noted above, in determining whether the Defendant \nSuppliers’ enrichment was at the Bank’s expense, the only relevant issue is whether there \nis a causative connection between their enrichment and the Bank’s loss.  \n Here, the Bank alleges that drawdowns under the Relevant Loans led to (caused) a series \nof other connected payments resulting in the Defendant Suppliers’ receipt of property (in the \nform of the Unreturned Prepayments) worth USD 1,911,877,385. I consider that if a causal \nconnection is found to exist between (i) the Bank’s payments to the Borrowers under the \nRelevant Loans, and (ii) the Borrowers’ payment of the Unreturned Prepayments to the \nDefendant Suppliers, then the Defendant Suppliers’ enrichment would be regarded as \nhaving been at the Bank’s expense. Causation is a question of fact under Ukrainian law (see \nfurther my response to question E5 above), and so whether or not a causal connection exists \nbetween these two series of payments is a question of fact. \n I do not, therefore, consider that the Bank’s claim under Article 1212 would be affected if it \nwere to be demonstrated that the monie"}

Although in this scenario, monies will have \ncome back to the Bank (in purported repayment of earlier loans), the Defendant Suppliers’ \nenrichment would still have been at the Bank’s expense. \n See further my response to question G3(a) above as regards the irrelevance to a claim \nunder Article 1212 of the Defendant Suppliers’ dissipation of their enrichment. \nC1/1/84\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 85 - d) a number of purported cash repayments of the capital advanced under the \nRelevant Loans and/or interest were made from funds advanced by the Bank \nunder other Relevant Loans or Intermediary Loans or New Loans, all of which \nwere void (on grounds of being contrary to Ukrainian public order, shams, related \nparty lending on preferential terms and/or unauthorised significant \ntransactions)? \n As explained in response to question E6(f) above, purported repayments of the Relevant \nLoans on the Bank’s books that are referable to later unlawful lending under void \nagreements are not, in my view, effective to reduce the Bank’s loss on the Relevant Loans. \nNor would such purported repayments alter the position (on the Bank’s case) that the \nDefendant Suppliers have received an enrichment at the expense of the Bank.  \nG6. In what circumstances will property acquired under a purported agreement have been \nacquired ‘without sufficient legal grounds’ for purposes of Article 1212? \n The requirement of a lack of sufficient legal grounds means that no obligation in unjust \nenrichment will arise if the acquirer is able to show that he had sufficient legal grounds for \nhis enrichment. For example, if the acquirer had a legal basis to acquire or retain the property \npursuant to a valid contract, then there will be no cause of action in unjust enrichment. This \nmay be overcome, however, if the contract is shown to be invalid, or if the contractual basis \non which the property was acquired later falls away (Article 1212(3)(1) of the Civil Code)85.  \n Under Ukrainian law, a transaction that is invalid on one of the grounds enumerated in the \nCivil Code has no legal effect, other than the legal effects arising out of its invalidity. For \nexample, if property passes under an invalid transaction, this may give rise to a duty of \nrestitution (Article 216(1) of the Civil Code). In addition, if a party seeks to rely on a \ntransaction as a lawful justification for his otherwise harmful actions and/or as a lawful basis \nfor receipt of property, the invalidity of that transaction should defeat that defence (i.e. \nrendering unlawful the basis for that party’s harmful actions and/or receipt of property). \n Abuse of rights rule .

A \nsimilar conclusion is found in the Supreme Court’s Civil Court of Cassation Resolutions dated 30 August \n2018 (case No. 334/2517/16-ts) and 13 January 2021 (case No. 539/3403/17).\nC1/1/85\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 86 - abusive purpose. Thus, if an acquirer relies upon a legal right as a defence to a claim in \nunjust enrichment, the court may refuse to protect that right if it is being exercised abusively. \nThe court may also refuse to enforce an otherwise valid transaction if it concludes that the \nperson relying upon the transaction is doing so abusively. So, for example, if the Supply \nAgreements were found to have been entered into with the intention of harming the Bank’s \nrights, and were therefore abusive, those agreements could not be relied upon as providing \nthe Defendant Suppliers with a lawful basis for receiving their enrichment (the Unreturned \nPrepayments), even if the Supply Agreements were not void on the grounds alleged by the \nBank. \nG7. Is it relevant to the Bank’s claims in unjust enrichment in these proceedings that: \n a) it has not sought declarations that the various purported agreements in the chain \nof transactions between the Bank and Defendant Suppliers are invalid? \n In order for the Bank to make out a claim in unjust enrichment against the Defendant \nSuppliers, it is not necessary to establish that all or any of the transactions in the chain were \ninvalid. It is sufficient to show that the Defendant Suppliers lacked sufficient legal grounds \nfor acquiring the USD 1,911,877,385 that they received. This could be done, for example, \nby establishing that (i) the Supply Agreements (alone), pursuant to which the Unreturned \nPrepayments were paid to the Defendant Suppliers, are void86; or (ii) it would be an abuse \nof rights for the Defendant Suppliers to rely upon the Supply Agreements as providing them \nwith a lawful basis to receive their enrichment. \nb) many of the parties to those purported agreements are not parties to these \nproceedings? \n It is irrelevant to the Bank’s unjust enrichment claim against the Defendant Suppliers that \nthe Borrowers are not parties to these proceedings. The proper defendants to the Bank’s \nunjust enrichment claim are those whom it is alleged by the Bank acquired or preserved \nproperty without sufficient legal grounds and at the Bank’s expense.

The failure to involve a potentially \naffected third party may mean that ( inter alia ) any judgment rendered will be appealable by \nthat third party in future. This, however, is a rule of Ukrainian procedural, not substantive, \nlaw, and I do not consider should be of any relevance to these proceedings, in which I \nunderstand the English court will apply its own rules of procedure. \nG8. What remedies are available for claims under Article 1212? \n Unjust enrichment must be returned in kind (Article 1213(1)). But if it is impossible to return \nthe unjustly acquired or preserved property in kind (as for example where the property has \nbeen dissipated), the acquirer shall afford compensation to the injured person for the \nproperty’s value, which is determined at the time the court hears the claim (Article 1213(2)). \n The acquirer is also liable to afford compensation to the injured party for all income that he \nobtained or could have obtained from the use of the property from the moment he obtained \nactual or constructive knowledge of his unjust enrichment. From this time, the acquirer is \nalso liable for any deterioration in the property allowed by him (Article 1214(1)). If the unjust \nenrichment is in the form of money, the acquirer is required to pay interest for use of the \ninjured party’s funds (Article 1214(2) of the Civil Code). \nG9. What rules of Ukrainian private international law would apply to determine the law \ngoverning the Bank’s claim in unjust enrichment (assuming that the matter does not \nfall to be determined under rules of English private international law)? \n Assuming, contrary to the Bank’s case, that this were an issue to be resolved under \nUkrainian law, then Article 51 of the Ukrainian Law “On International Private Law” (the “ PIL \nLaw”) would apply: \n“The obligations arising out of the acquisition, preservation of property without sufficient legal \ngrounds, shall be governed by the law of the State in which such actions took place. \n87  See Article 53 of the Code of Civil Procedure and Article 50 of the Code of Commercial Procedure. \nC1/1/87\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 88 - The parties to the obligation may, at any time after it has arisen, agree to the application of \nthe law of the State of the court”.\n I am aware from my review of the parties’ pleadings that the Defendant Suppliers allege that \nArticle 38(2) of the PIL Law also would be relevant to determining the law that governs the \nBank’s unjust enrichment claim.

COMPETITION OFCLAIMS\nH1. Can a claim in tort or unjust enrichment be brought if a claim for breach of contract \nis available to the claimant? \n In general, where multiple causes of action are available to a claimant arising out of a \nparticular set of facts, then the claimant generally will be free to choose which cause(s) of \naction will be pursued.  \n Where there is a valid contract in place between a claimant and defendant, then, in relation \nto any overlapping tort or unjust enrichment claim brought by the claimant against that \ndefendant, the defendant may have a defence that the terms of the contract should prevail \nin their relationship but only (i) if the subject matter of the claim is governed by the contract; \nand (ii) to the extent of any inconsistency between the contract and the rules governing tort \nor unjust enrichment claims, as the case may be. To the extent that the subject matter of the \ntort or unjust enrichment claim is not governed by the contract, then the defendant would \nnot be able to rely on the contract in defending that claim. In case No. 910/14469/18, \nC1/1/88\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 89 - Minudobreniya JSC v. Ukrainian Railways JSC , the Supreme Court upheld the following \nposition of the first instance court88: \n“it should be taken into account that there may be events where parties are involved in a \ncontractual relationship, but the harm caused by one party to the other is not connected with \nthe performance of an obligation arising out of the contract. In the circumstances, a decision \non the dispute should rely on the compensation provisions applicable to non-contractual \nharm as contained in the Ukrainian Civil Code and the Ukrainian Commercial Code, whether \nthere is a contract or not. \nAnother reason why the proper delineation of grounds for liability is necessary is because \nthe amount of compensation for damages caused to a creditor as a result of failure to \nperform or properly perform contractual obligations may be limited (Article 225 of the \nUkrainian Commercial Code), while (in the case of compensation for non-contractual harm) \nsuch harm is recoverable in full (Article 1166 of the Ukrainian Commercial Code) ”. \n In my response to question H2 below, I consider this issue further in the specific context of \na tort claim against a bank executive who has a contract of employment or a contract for \nservices with the bank. In relation to an unjust enrichment claim that overlaps with a contract \nbetween the parties, I note that Article 1212(3) of the Civil Code confirms that an unjust \nenrichment claim can arise between parties to a valid contract. Where, for example, a seller \ndelivers the wrong property to the buyer under a sale contract, and the buyer refuses to \nreturn it, then the contract will not provide a defence to an unjust enrichment claim (the \nsubject matter of claim in this case will not be governed by the contract)89. \n Where a claimant brings a claim in tort and/or unjust enrichment against multiple defendants, \nand a valid contr"}

Can an executive or officer of a bank be sued for breach of Article 63 of the JSC Law, \nArticles 42 or 43 of the Law on Banks, and/or Article 1166 of the Civil Code, if he/she \nis bound by a contract of employment or a contract for services and the alleged harm \nwas inflicted in the course of his/her employment or as a result of actions or \nomissions that fall within the scope of that contract? \n In my view, provided that the relevant actions or omissions of the bank’s executive/officer \nsatisfy the requirements for a tort claim under Article 1166, and the duties they breached go \nbeyond those created by any such contracts of employment/services, the bank can pursue \nremedies against them in tort. I further consider that where bank executives cause harm to \na bank by breaching their so-called fiduciary duties (as described in section F above), such \nconduct will be highly unlikely to be treated by the Ukrainian courts as connected to the    \n(non) performance of their contractual obligations, but will instead be treated as connected \nto the breach of their fiduciary obligations. In this regard, I note that in Ukoopspilka Joint-\nStock Bank PJSC v. Person 1 et al  (introduced at paragraph 74 above) senior members of \na bank’s management and supervisory boards who caused the bank to invest around 60% \nof its assets in illiquid securities of little to no value, leading to the bank’s insolvency, were \nfound liable to the bank in tort under Article 1166 notwithstanding that they appear to have \nhad contracts of employment with the bank90.  \n My opinion in this regard is further supported by court practice recognising that company \nofficers and bank executives who have contracts of employment have a dual legal status as \n(i) members of a company’s bodies/company officers/bank executives (within the meaning \nof the Civil Code, JSC Law and Law on Banks, respectively) exercising managerial \nresponsibility, and (ii) employees performing the tasks and duties of their jobs.

LLC “Torhovyi Dim “Homelsklo-Ukraina” , a company dismissed Person 2 from \nthe position of General Director pursuant to Article 41(1)(5) of the Labour Code of Ukraine, \nwhich permits the powers of an executive body member to be terminated at any time on any \ngrounds. Person 2 claimed that her dismissal was unlawful because she was not notified \nabout her forthcoming dismissal two months in advance as required under her employment \ncontract with the company. The court confirmed that there was no violation on the part of \nthe company: \n“Interpretation of Article 41(1)(5) of the Labour Code of Ukraine and Article 99(3) of the Civil \nCode of Ukraine shows that termination of powers of the executive body member may occur \nat any time and on any grounds. At that, termination of powers of the executive body member \nis guaranteed by the rules of civil law in order to stop or prevent negative impact on the \nmanagement of the company.

The courts at first instance and on appeal decided that the claim was in \nnature a labour dispute and should be considered in the courts of general jurisdiction.

As I explain below, the effect of this is that I consider \nthat the Ukrainian courts today would likely interpret Article 261 such that a limitation period \nwill be calculated from the date on which the claimant became aware, or could have become \naware, of both the violation of its right and the person who violated such right. \n Supporting such an interpretation of Article 261, former Supreme Court President Yaroslav \nRomaniuk wrote the following in an academic article published on 22 March 2018: \n“The claimant having no information about the identity of the violator of its right makes it \neffectively impossible for the court to accept its statement of claim to consider it on the \nmerits. If the claimant specifies the defendant’s identity information in his statement of claim, \nthe court will consider it on the merits, even if submitted after the expiry of the limitation \nperiod. An analysis of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights on the \napplication of Article 6(1) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights \nand Fundamental Freedoms in terms of the “right to a trial”, and a systemic interpretation of \nArticles 256 and 261 of the Ukrainian Civil Code and Articles 175 and 185 of the Ukrainian \nCode of Civil Procedure, offer a conclusion that the limitation period should be calculated \nfrom the date on which a person became or could have become aware of both the violation \nof its right and the person who violated such right . A claimant may become aware of those \nthings at the same time. Otherwise, the limitation period should be calculated from the date \non which a claimant became or could have become aware of the second of them, which is \nusually the violator’s identity. The first thing is always necessary because no claimant will \nbecome entitled to sue to protect its right in court without that right having been violated. A \nclaimant having information regarding either of those things (being usually aware only of a \nviolation of his right) will not cause the limitation period to run”91.\n Notably, the courts have also started to take such an approach. For example, the Horodok \nDistrict Court of the Lviv Region, in its Decision dated 23 March 2018 in case No. \n91  Article of Romaniuk Y. “Addressing The Challenges Of Determining When The Limitation Of Action Period \nStarts To Ru"}

Person 4 and Sukhovilsk village council of Horodok district of \nLviv region , rejected a limitation defence expressly on the basis that time was to be \ncalculated from the date when the claimant became aware of both a right violation and the \nviolator’s identity:  \n“Based on an analysis of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights on the \napplication of Article 6(1) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights \nand Fundamental Freedoms in terms of the “right to a trial”, and a systemic interpretation of \nArticles 256 and 261 of the Ukrainian Civil Code, the court concludes that the limitation \nperiod should be calculated from the date on which a person became or could have become \naware of both the violation of his right and the person who violated such right”.\n The above ruling was subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court92, and the interpretation \nof Article 261 that it favours was also supported by the Supreme Court’s Resolution dated \n18 March 2020 in case No. 310/2647/17-ts, Person 1 v. Person 2 et al .  \n I consider it likely that the Ukrainian courts will continue to follow this approach in future \nwhen determining when limitation starts to run under Article 261 (although in any event it \nwould remain open for the courts effectively to extend the limitation period under Article \n267(5) in circumstances where a claimant does not know the identity of the person who \nviolated his rights, as I explain below). \n Knowledge of violation of right. In case No. 321/1702/16-ts, Ukrainian Railways PJSC v. \nPerson 1, the Supreme Court specified in its Resolution of 10 July 2019 that: “ the \ncommencement of the limitation period coincides with the time when the person becomes \nentitled to sue and able to enforce his right in court ”. Consistent with this guidance, I consider \nthat in order for a claimant to have sufficient knowledge of a violation of his right for purposes \nof limitation, I consider that they must have actual or constructive knowledge of facts or \nmatters sufficient to allow them to allege the existence of each of the elements of the cause \nof action to which the violation in question gives rise.  \n In the case of a tort claim, for example, I consider that a claimant must have knowledge of \nfacts or matters sufficient to allow them to file a valid claim at court alleging: (i) unlawful \nconduct by some other person, (ii) harm suffered by the claimant, (iii) a causal connection \n92  Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 26 December 2019, case No. 441/755/15-ts, Person 7 v.

I am not aware of any test that exists under Ukrainian law as to the \nquality of knowledge that a person must have for purposes of starting the limitation period \nrunning. Ultimately, the existence of such knowledge will be a question of fact for the court \nto resolve in view of all the circumstances of the case. I would not, however, consider that a \nperson who merely suspects the presence of facts or matters sufficient to satisfy an element \nof a cause of action would have such knowledge as a matter of Ukrainian law.  \n Knowledge of a corporate entity. When applying limitation rules to a claimant company, I \nconsider that it is the knowledge of the management body with the authority to bring a claim \non behalf of the claimant company that should matter (I consider in response to question I5 \nbelow which was the relevant management body within the Bank). But further to what I have \nsaid above in response to question E10, Ukrainian law does not have developed rules as \nregards attributing the knowledge of the executives or officers of a bank or other corporate \nentity to that entity itself, and in my view a Ukrainian court would likely take a common sense \napproach to determining what ‘the Bank’ knew (or could have known), and when.  \n In this regard, I note that where a company is defrauded by its agent, the Ukrainian courts \nwill not attribute to the victim company the agent’s knowledge of the fraud. For example, in \na case decided by the Donetsk Commercial Court of Appeal on 13 December 201794 (upheld \n93  For the avoidance of doubt, all four elements of a claim under Article 1166 must be alleged by a claimant, \neven where the presumptions of unlawfulness and/or fault apply (discussed above at paragraphs 93 and \n173). \n94  Resolution of the Donetsk Commercial Court of Appeal, dated 13 December 2017, No. 21/89b/2011, \nStriletskyi Step Milovskyi zavod rafinovanoyi olii PJSC v. Belovodskyi Elevator LLC . \nC1/1/95\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 96 - by the Supreme Court on 18 June 201895), a claim was brought by a company’s receiver to \ninvalidate numerous contracts concluded between the company, represented by a previous \nmanager, and one of its related parties (the defendant) with the aim of causing the \ncompany’s bankruptcy. The defendant argued that the receiver’s claim had been brought \nbeyond the applicable limitation period. In rejecting this argument, the court found that the \nlimitation period should run from the moment of the receiver’s appointment. In this way, the \nknowledge of the company’s previous manager, who was complicit in the fraud, about the \nunlawful agreements was not attributed to the company.  \nI3. On what grounds can a limitation period be extended or disapplied? \n Ukrainian courts have a wide discretion to disallow a limitation defence if there exists a valid \nreason to do so (Article 267(5) of the Civil Code). \n The High Commercial Court (which, as explained at paragraph 27 above, was abolished by \nrecent judicial reforms, although its practice continues to be relied upon) has held in \nResolution No 10 of its Plenary session that the issue of whether a ‘valid reason’ within the \nmeaning of Article 267(5) of the Civil Code exists is fact intensive and must be "}

The key consideration is whether there are ‘‘objective reasons \nbeyond the claimant’s control that prevented or significantly hindered the claimant from \nbringing the action in due time”97. ‘Objective’, as used in this context, means that the court \nwill assess the sufficiency of the claimant’s asserted reasons for failing to bring a claim within \nthe limitation period on an objective basis, applying a standard of reasonableness.\n As noted above, a claimant’s lack of knowledge as to the identity of the person that violated \nits rights has been found to constitute a valid reason for applying Article 267(5), effectively \nallowing a claim to be maintained that prima facie was out of time. In a Decision of the \nCommercial Court of the Vinnytsia Region dated 29 August 2013, in case No. \n6/63/2012/5003, Ukragroleasing National Joint Stock Company SPJSC v. Svitanok \nAgricultural Company of the Limited Liability , the court ruled as follows: \n“A bona fide acquirer may not be considered a violator of a property owner’s right of \nownership.

Belovodskyi Elevator LLC . \n96  Resolution of the High Commercial Court of Ukraine No. 10 dated 29 May 2013 “ On certain issues of the \npractice of applying the limitation period in the settlement of commercial disputes ”. \n97Ibid, paragraph 2.2 .\nC1/1/96\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 97 - acquirer begins to run from the time when the owner became aware or should have become \naware of a violation of the owner’s right. The owner is not, however, deprived of the right to \nseek protection for such owner’s right by having the reasons for missing the period found \nvalid under Article 267(5) of the Civil Code. Such valid reason may be the owner’s lack of \ninformation about the possessor of the property that belongs to the owner. \nThe attorney for the defendant argues that the claimant has missed the limitation period of \nthree years for bringing any reclamation claims in respect of the property in dispute because \nit was far back as June 2007 that it was entitled (under the lease agreement) to demand that \nthe leased property be returned due to failure to observe the terms of rent payment \nthereunder. The attorney for the defendant is therefore of the opinion that the claim should \nbe dismissed due to the claimant having missed the limitation period. \nIndeed, the court agrees that the claimant has missed the limitation period for suing, given \nthat it became aware of the violation of its right earlier than three years before the date of \nbringing the claim. In particular, the court has also found that the claimant attended the 30 \nJanuary 2009 meeting of the committee of creditors of state-run airline Silhospaviatsiia \nUkrainy at which the receiver informed the creditors that the debtor had no property assets, \nincluding that the debtor had no possession of the MTZ-82.1.26 tractor, serial number \nNUMBER_4, which the claimant had leased out under the Financial Lease Agreement No. \n2-7-261 fl, dated 14 May 2007.  \nHowever, the claimant was objectively unable to bring a vindicatory action within the \nstatutory period because the claimant was unaware of the whereabouts and the new owner \n(bona fide acquirer) of the equipment, despite the measu"}

It was not until 6 June 2012 that the claimant managed to receive the letter from \nthe Ukrainian State Agricultural Inspectorate (bundle pages 194 to 195, bundle 2) providing \ninformation regarding the whereabouts and the new owner (bona fide acquirer) of the tractor. \nFurther, the requests for the relevant information that had been addressed to the State \nTechnical Supervision Inspectorate for years before that had been fruitless, according to \ntheir letters of response (bundle pages 192 to 193, bundle 2).  \nTo enable the claimant to protect its violated right, the court therefore (by virtue of Article \n267(6)98 of the Ukrainian Civil Code) considers it necessary to find that the reasons why \nUkragroleasing has missed the limitation period are valid.  \nBased on all of the foregoing, the claims should be allowed”. \n As I have explained in response to question I2 above, however, I consider that the position \nthat would likely be taken in such a case by the Ukrainian courts is that limitation would not \nbegin to run unless and until the claimant has knowledge of the identity of the person that \nviolated its rights.  \n98  I consider this reference to Article 267(6) to be a typographical error in the judgment. The reference should \nbe to Article 267(5). \nC1/1/97\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 98 -  In its Resolution dated 23 October 2018, case No. 904/5978/14, Orbita Scientific and \nProduction Company CJSC v. Hlibzavod No. 10 LLC , the Supreme Court found that a \nliquidator’s actions contrary to the interests of the debtor company and its creditors \nconstituted circumstances that significantly hampered the commencement of a claim and \namounted to a valid reason for the claimant failing to act within the applicable limitation \nperiod. \n In the present case, I understand that the Bank will rely upon ( inter alia ) the First and Second \nDefendants’ control of the Bank prior to nationalisation and the systematic concealment of \nthe Misappropriation during that period to contend (if necessary to do so) that this is an \nappropriate case for the court to exercise its discretion to allow the Bank to bring its causes \nof action outside the limitation period. In my view, to the extent such matters are established \nto have prevented or significantly hindered the Bank from bringing its claims within three \nyears of the Misappropriation, then I consider Article 267(5) would appropriately be applied. \nIn such a case, I consider that a court would have to be satisfied that in all the relevant \ncircumstances the Bank’s new management (i.e. post-nationalisation) had acted with \nreasonable diligence to commence these proceedings.  \n Abuse of rights. As I have explained at paragraphs 81 to 88 above, under Article 16(3) of \nthe Civil Code, the court has a discretion to refuse to recognise or uphold a legal right where \nit concludes that that right is being exercised in an abusive manner or for an abusive \npurpose. I believe this could provide a claimant with a further basis for overcoming a \nlimitation defence.  \n Although I am unaware of any Ukrainian case law in which the abuse of rights rule has been \nconsidered specifically in the context of a limitation defence, the Supreme Commercial Court \nof Russia, whose Civil Code (like that of Ukraine) is based on the CIS Model Civil Code and \nis broadly similar in its content and effect, has held that a limitation defence may be \ndismissed as an abu"}

See Priokskoye LLC v. Aquamarine LLC et \nal, Supreme Commercial Court of the Russian Federation (Presidium), 22 November 2011, \ncase No. 17912/09. A similar conclusion was reached by a Ukrainian appellate court in the \nC1/1/98\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 99 - case I have referred to at paragraph 298 above99, although in that case the court did not \nspecifically invoke the rule against abuse of rights.  \nI4. Which party bears the burden of proof in relation to a limitation defence? \n Under Ukrainian law, each party generally bears the burden of proving facts and matters \nupon which they wish to rely. So where a defendant raises a limitation defence, i.e. wishes \nto allege and rely upon the fact that the claimant had or could have had sufficient knowledge \nfor purposes of limitation more than three years before commencing the claim, the burden \nof proof lies on the defendant. The claimant in response to a limitation defence will have the \nopportunity to adduce evidence showing that it did not have, nor could have had, sufficient \nknowledge within the limitation period. Also, where a claimant alleges that a limitation period \nshould be disapplied under Article 267(5) of the Civil Code or on the basis of the abuse of \nrights rule, the burden of proof for establishing such grounds for disallowance lies on the \nclaimant.\nI5. Would the knowledge of (i) members of the Bank’s Supervisory Board or (ii) members \nof the Bank’s Management Board be relevant for determining when limitation started \nto run in relation to the Bank’s claims?  \n As I have stated above in response to question E10, Ukrainian law does not have developed \nrules as regards imputing (attributing) the knowledge of a natural person to a company, and \na Ukrainian court would likely take a common sense approach to determining whether the \nknowledge of a particular person associated with a company (such as a member of its \nSupervisory Board or Management Board) will be attributed to that company. I would \nconsider, however, that the knowledge of members of the Bank’s Management Board would \nbe more likely to be considered relevant for purposes of limitation than the knowledge of \nmembers of its Supervisory Board, because, as I explain below, the Bank’s Management \nBoard, and not its Supervisory Board, appears to have had the power to authorise the \ninstruction of third party legal advisors and commencement of legal proceedings. \n Role and powers of a bank’s management board.

Where no agreement in relation to interest exists between the \ncreditor and debtor, it is necessary to turn to other provisions of the Civil Code to find the \nrate of interest applicable in particular circumstances. In particular, Article 625 of the Civil \nCode (“ Article 625 ”) provides that a debtor in default of a monetary obligation is liable upon \nthe creditor’s demand to pay the principal debt, adjusted for inflation, plus interest of 3% per \nannum.  \n On 10 April 2018, the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court issued a Resolution in case \nNo. 910/10156/17 in relation to the application of Article 625. The Grand Chamber said that \nArticle 625 applies to all types of monetary obligations, including where an unjust enrichment \nclaim is made in respect of money. The Grand Chamber also stated that Article 625 will \napply where a debtor is under a legal obligation to return funds to a creditor but fails to do \nso: \n“41. Moreover, in the resolution of the Supreme Court of Ukraine dated 1 June 2016 in case \nNo. 910/22034/15, it was concluded that Article 625 of the Ukrainian Civil Code applies to \nall types of monetary obligations. The Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court agrees with \nthis conclusion. Therefore, in the event of a delay in the fulfillment of an obligation, in \nparticular with regard to the return of unjustly acquired or preserved money, 3% per annum \nis charged on the overdue amount in accordance with Article 625(2) of the Ukrainian Civil \nCode. \n42. The argument of the City Council that the prescription of the Article 625(2) of the \nUkrainian Civil Code can be applied by the commercial court only if there is a violation by \nthe debtor of a monetary obligation is not taken into account, because it exactly violated the \nnon-contractual monetary obligation arising on the basis of Article 1212 of the Ukrainian Civil \nCode ”102. \n See also the Resolution of Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court dated 22 September 2020, \nin case No. 918/631/19, LLC “Ukrainska Burshtynova Kompania” to the State Enterprise \n“Burshtyn Ukrainy”:  \n“77.

I consider that this would accord with: \n the principle of full compensation reflected in Article 1166(1): “ harm caused to the \nproperty of a natural or legal person, shall be compensated in full by the person who \ninflicted the harm ” (see also Articles 1191(1) and 22(3) of the Civil Code, discussed at \nparagraph 69 above); and \n the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court’s conclusion that interest payable under \nArticle 625 of the Civil Code “ has a compensatory, not a penalty nature, since it is a \nway to protect property rights and interests, which consists in obtaining compensation \nfrom the debtor”105. \n I also consider that in a case involving misappropriation of funds, it would be open to a \nclaimant to seek an award of compound interest on the basis that this represents a fair \nquantification of the claimant’s lost profit, which is a type of loss that is recoverable under \nArticle 22(2)(2) of the Civil Code.

OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OFUKRAINIAN ENTITIES \nK1. During the period from April 2013 to the Bank’s nationalisation, in what \ncircumstances could a natural person (or persons) be said as a matter of Ukrainian \nlaw to own and/or control a bank? \n In my view, only persons meeting the statutory definition of ‘controller’ of a bank, a term \ndefined in the Law on Banks, would be considered as a matter of Ukrainian law to control \nthat bank. (As I explain at the end of my response below, in my view it does not take matters \nany further to consider separately who might be said, as a matter of Ukrainian law, to ‘own’ \nas opposed to ‘control’ a bank.) \n Article 2 of the Law on Banks (version as of 1 January 2013) contained the following \ndefinition of “ controller” , which remained unchanged through the Bank’s nationalisation at \nthe end of 2016: \n“an individual or legal entity that is not under the control of individuals and that is able to \nexercise decisive influence on the management or business of a legal entity through the \ndirect and/or indirect ownership (whether alone or jointly with others) of a shareholding in \nsuch legal entity that is equivalent to 50 per cent or more of the authorised capital and/or \nvotes in such legal entity or that is able to exercise such"}

I consider that, properly construed, this \ndefinition further means that a person will be found to have such ability to exercise decisive \ninfluence if that person: \n directly or indirectly owns (alone or jointly with others) a shareholding in the bank that \nrepresents 50% or more of the bank’s authorised capital;  \nC1/1/110\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 111 -  directly or indirectly owns (alone or jointly with others) a shareholding in the bank that \ncarries with it the ability to vote more than 50% of the votes at a general meeting of the \nbank’s members; or \n regardless of that person’s formal ownership of the bank’s authorised capital and/or \nvoting rights, is able to exercise the influence that a person falling in category (a) or (b) \nabove could exercise either: \n as a matter of contract; or \n “otherwise ”, i.e. as a result of any other circumstances. \n I consider that the word “ otherwise ” in the above definition of ‘controller’ isbroad enough to \nencompass circumstances where: \n a person, when acting together with one or more other persons, is able to exercise \ndecisive influence over a bank’s management or business regardless of their formal \nownership of the bank’s authorised capital or voting rights; and/or \n a person, as a matter of practice, can exercise decisive influence over other persons \nas a result of nominee, trust or other contractual or non-contractual arrangements \nbetween them, as a result of which that (first) person can exercise decisive influence \non the management or business of a bank (as I explain further below, the definition of \n‘indirect ownership’ under Ukrainian law also supports this conclusion). \n Owner of a significant participation. Before considering the definition of “ controller ” further, I \nshould first explain that Article 2 of the Law on Banks defines another term that is relevant \nto consider for purposes of responding to this question: owner of a “ significant participation ” \nin a bank. That term means: \n“(i) the direct and/or indirect ownership by a person, whether alone or jointly with others, of \n10 per cent or more of the authorised capital and/or the voting rights attached to shares or \nstakes in a legal entity, or (ii) an ability to exercise significant influence on the management \nor business of a legal entity, regardless of formal ownership.

A person could simultaneously satisfy both definitions, but \nin my view, as a matter of Ukrainian law a person could be said to control a bank only if such \nperson met the statutory definition of ‘controller’ (and not merely the statutory definition of \n‘owner of a significant participation’). Nevertheless, in my view certain regulations made by \nthe NBU to elaborate upon the meaning of “ significant participation ” are also relevant to \ninterpreting the definition of “ controller ” set out above. \n Indirect ownership. As set out above, the definition of “ controller ” includes circumstances in \nwhich a person owns (alone or jointly with others) 50% or more of a bank’s authorised capital \nor voting rights indirectly. I consider that guidance as to the meaning of indirect ownership \nfor purposes of this definition can be taken from NBU Resolution No. 306, dated 8 \nSeptember 2011, approving a “Regulation on the procedure for registration and licensing of \nbanks, opening of separate divisions” (“ Regulation 306 ”), which provided at paragraph 4.2 \nof Chapter 4 of Section II: \n“Indirect ownership of participation in a bank arises if a person, whether alone or jointly with \nothers, inter alia: \n(a) controls the direct owner of a participation in a bank; and/or \n(b) controls a group of direct owners of a legal entity; and/or \n(c) controls a person that controls the persons mentioned above; and/or … ”107. \n From 6 June 2015 until the Bank’s nationalisation, the above language was amended to \nread: \n“3.

NBU Resolution No. 368 of 28 August 2001, approving an “Instruction on \nBanking Regulation Procedures in Ukraine”109, identified the following circumstances in \nwhich two or more persons will be deemed to jointly own shares in a bank: \n“1.12. Significant participation in a bank or another legal entity means that an individual or \nlegal entity, directly and/or indirectly, and whether alone or jointly with others, holds:  \n(a) a participation/shareholding in a bank or another legal entity (and/or the voting rights \nattached to shares, stakes or interests) that constitutes 10 per cent or more of its authorised \ncapital.\nFurther, two or more persons shall be deemed to jointly own shares \n(stakes/interests) in a bank or another legal entity if they own shares \n(stakes/interests) in such bank or such other legal entity and, at the same time: \n1) are members of the board or the management board (board of directors) of, own \na significant participation in, or are the legal representatives of, the same legal entity; \nor \n108  Paragraph 3 of Chapter 4 of Section II of Regulation 306. \n109  Version as of 1 January 2013. \nC1/1/113\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 114 - 2) either of those persons has provided a loan to the other to purchase shares \n(stakes/interests) in the bank or such other legal entity; or \n3) they are associates of each other; or \nb) regardless of formal ownership, the ability to exercise significant influence on the \nmanagement or business of the bank or such other legal entity and, in particular, the ability \nto influence any lending, investment and accounting policies, or decision making as regards \nthe key areas of business, of the bank or such other legal entity contractually or \notherwise ”110. \n Factors relevant to the exercise of decisive/significant influence. As also set out above, the \ndefinition of “ controller ” includes circumstances in which a person, regardless of formal \nownership rights (i.e. of a bank’s authorised capital or voting rights) is “ otherwise ” able to \nexercise decisive influence over a bank’s management or business.

That definition indicates that decisive influence can be found to exist on the basis \nof: \n110  Paragraph 1.12 of sub-chapter 1 of Chapter 6 of Instruction 368, excluded in version as of 15 June 2015. \nC1/1/114\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 115 -  rights to own or use all of an entity’s assets or their significant part;  \n rights that provide decisive influence as to the formation, voting results and decisions \nof an entity’s governing bodies; \n the conclusion of agreements and contracts that make it possible to determine the \nentity’s conditions of commercial activity; or \n an ability to give binding instructions to or perform the functions of an entity’s \nmanagement body. \n ‘Ownership’ of a bank. Lastly in relation to this question, I do not consider that it progresses \nmy analysis above any further to consider who, as a matter of Ukrainian law, can be said to \n‘own’ (as opposed to ‘control’) a bank. Whilst in layman’s terms one might refer in Ukraine \nto a particular person (or group of persons) as ‘owning’ a particular bank, that is not a \nconcept that is defined in the Law on Banks or anywhere else in relation to banks. The \nconcept of ownership is instead defined only in broad and general terms, in particular by \nArticle 316(1) of the Civil Code, which states that a right of ownership is a person’s right to \na thing (property) that is exercised in accordance with the law, at that person’s own will and \nregardless of the will of others. If one were to apply these criteria in an attempt to identify \nwho ‘owns’ a bank, I do not consider that this would point to any different person(s) than \nthose identified by applying the criteria set out in the definition of “ controller ”.  \nK2. During the period from April 2013 to the Bank’s nationalisation, in what \ncircumstances could a natural person (or persons) be said as a matter of Ukrainian \nlaw to control any and all: \na) material decisions in relation to the Bank’s management and affairs, in particular \nmaterial decisions which were contrary to the best interests of the Bank and/or \ncontrary to Ukrainian law and/or contrary to the Bank’s internal policies; and/or \nb) of the types of decisions listed in paragraph 2 of the Bank’s Response to the First \nDefendant’s Fourth Request for Further Information dated 30 July 2021 (“RFI \nResponse”) ? \n I am aware that the Bank alleges at paragraph 5 of its Particulars of Claim (as amended) \nthat the First and Second Defendants “ together controlled all significant decisions made by \nthe Bank ”. Ukrainian banking law does not define the term ‘significant decision’, but I \nunderstand from the RFI Response, a copy of which has been provided to me by Hogan \nLovells, that by this term the Bank refers to the types of decision referred to at (a) and (b) in \nC1/1/115\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 116 - the question above.

I note that Ukrainian banking law also does not define the term ‘material \ndecision’ as used in the RFI Response (and in the question above), and so I consider that \nwhether or not a particular decision falls within this definition is a question of fact that will be \ndetermined with reference to the ordinary English meaning of the word ‘material’. \n In view of the above, the identity of the person(s) who could control any particular decision \nfalling within the categories identified above will vary, depending on which body of the Bank \nwas authorised during the relevant period to take that particular decision. I understand, \nhowever, that the question seeks my opinion as to which person(s) could be said to control \nevery one of the decisions in these categories. \n According to Article 38(1) of the Law on Banks111, general meetings of a bank’s shareholders \nwere a bank’s supreme management body during the relevant period. Under Article 33(1) \nof the JSC Law112, such general meetings could resolve any issues related to the activities \nof the joint stock company. Under Article 33(2),(17)-(18) of the JSC Law113, such general \nmeetings could, inter alia , appoint and dismiss members of a bank’s supervisory board. \nAccording to Article 42(3) of the JSC Law114, any matter put to a vote at a general meeting \nof a joint stock company’s shareholders was to be decided by a simple majority of votes cast \nby the attending shareholders who had registered for the general meeting, unless otherwise \nprescribed by the JSC Law. \n Therefore, if a person, whether alone or jointly with other shareholders, held (or otherwise \nhad the ability to control the vote of) more than 50% of the voting shares in a bank, such \nshareholder(s) would be able to pass (or procure the passage of) any decision at a general \nmeeting of that bank’s shareholders115 (save for certain decisions for which a three-fourths \n111  In a version as of 1 January 2013.

After said amendments and through the \nend of the relevant period, a general meeting was quorate if the shareholders who had \nregistered for the meeting held 50% or more of the company’s voting shares.  \n I consider, therefore, that a person (or persons acting together) could be said as a matter of \nUkrainian Law to control any and all of the decisions identified in the question above if they \nheld or otherwise had the ability to control the vote of at least 60% of the Bank’s voting \nshares, falling to more than 50% after 27 March 2015. \nK3. During the period from April 2013 to the Bank’s nationalisation, in what \ncircumstances could a natural person (or persons) be said as a matter of Ukrainian \nlaw to ultimately own and/or control a Ukrainian public joint stock company (other \nthan a bank)? \n Under Article 1(1)(20) of Ukrainian Law on Anti-Money Laundering or Terrorist Financing of \n28 November 2002 (“ Law 249-IV ”) (in effect until 24 November 2014), “ control of a legal \nentity ” was defined as (i) direct or indirect ownership by a natural person, alone or jointly \nwith close relatives, of a share in a legal entity corresponding to the equivalent of 50% or \nmore of the authorised capital or votes of that entity, or (ii) the ability to exercise decisive \ninfluence over the management or business of that entity, independent of formal ownership.  \n116  Under Article 42(5) of the JSC Law, decisions taken at a general meeting of members on the issues \nidentified at paragraphs 2 to 7 and 23 of Article 33(2) of the JSC Law required more than three-fourths of \nthe attending shareholders’ votes to pass. These included decisions to: “ 2) make amendments to the \ncharter of the company; 3) decide on cancellations of shares repurchased; 4) decide to change the type \nof the company; 5) pass a resolution to offer shares; 6) decide on an increase in the authorised capital of \nthe company; 7) decide on a reduction in the authorised capital of the company; 23) pass a resolution on \na spin-off and dissolution of the company … ”. \nC1/1/117\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 118 -  Amongst other things, the Law on the Identification of Ultimate Beneficiaries of Legal Entities \nand Publicly Exposed Persons (Legislative Amendments) of 14 October 2014, which came \ninto effect on 25 November 2014 (“ Law 1701-VII ”), amended Law 249-IV to introduce a new \nterm, “ ultimate beneficiary ” in respect of a legal entity, defined as: \n“an individual (i) who is able to exercise decisive influence on the management or business \nof a legal entity, regardless of formal ownership, and whether directly or through others, \nwhich influence is, inter alia, exercised through the right to own or use all or substantially all \nassets and/or the right to exercise decisive influence on a constitution, voting results and \nthe execution of transactions, which make it possible to determine conditions for its \nbusiness, to give binding instructions or to act as its management body, or (ii) who was able \nto exercise influence117 through the ownership, whether direct or indirect (through another \nin"}

From that date, the term “ ultimate beneficiary ” as used in \nrespect of a legal entity was replaced with “ ultimate beneficial owner (controller) ”, the \ndefinition of which matched the prior definition of ‘ultimate beneficiary’ as set out above. \n At no point has the JSC Law been amended to introduce a definition of “ ultimate beneficiary ” \nor “ultimate beneficial owner (controller) ” that is specific to joint stock companies, and so the \ngeneral definition set out above applies to such companies as well as all other legal entities. \nConsistent with that definition, in my view a natural person (or persons) can be said as a \nmatter of Ukrainian law to ultimately own and/or control a Ukrainian public joint stock \ncompany (other than a bank), if such person:  \n is able to exercise decisive influence on the management or business of that legal \nentity, regardless of formal ownership, and whether directly or through others (which \ninfluence is, inter alia , exercised through the right to own or use all or substantially all \nof the entity’s assets and/or the right to exercise decisive influence on the entity’s \nconstitution, voting results and the execution of transactions, which made it possible to \n117  Unlike in the first part of the definition, which refers to “decisive influence”, this second part of the definition \nrefers only to “influence”. \nC1/1/118\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 119 - determine conditions for its business, to give binding instructions or to act as its \nmanagement body); or  \n is able to exercise influence through the ownership, whether direct or indirect (through \nanother individual or legal entity), and whether alone or jointly with other related \nindividuals and/or legal entities, of a shareholding in such legal entity that constitutes \n25% or more of the authorised capital and/or voting rights in such legal entity. \nK4.

In the \ncircumstances of this case, therefore, the (non-resident) Suppliers’ failure to return \nprepayments to the (resident) Borrowers would expose the Borrowers to potential liability.  \n Resident’s liability for daily interest charge. In particular, under Article 4(1) of the Foreign \nCurrency Payments Law128 a failure to comply with the deadlines discussed above would \nresult in the imposition of a daily interest charge of 0.3% of the value of the non-delivered \ngoods for each day of non-performance by the non-resident:  \n“Article 4.

Proceeds of the sale were then credited to the \nresident’s UAH account.\n The above rules applied to foreign currency receipts arising from a non-resident supplier’s \nrefund of a resident’s advance payment following non-delivery of purchased goods. This is \nreflected in, for example, paragraph 7 of the Regulation on Foreign Currency Trading \nProcedures and Conditions as approved by NBU Resolution No. 281 dated 10 August \n2005142, which provided: “ a market entity shall, without any instruction from its resident \ncustomer, and on or before the business day immediately following the date when they are \ncredited to the distribution account, sell foreign currency funds purchased and transferred \nto a non-resident, which were refunded to a resident due to complete or partial failure to \nperform any mutual obligations ”.\nL3.

The \nparagraph also makes clear that, in addition to information and explanations, original or \ncopy documents must be provided upon request, and that the scope of such requests \nextends to compliance with financial monitoring, banking legislation and NBU \nregulations, and the bank’s operations. \n Resolution 561/BT did not specifically refer to the above paragraphs of Regulation 346, but \ndid state in general terms, at paragraph 1, that the Curator was appointed “ to ensure the \nperformance of functions in accordance with the powers defined by Regulation No. 346 ”.

Any such \nadditional powers would have to have been granted by way of a further NBU resolution, and \nI am not aware of any such resolution having been made in respect of the Curator at the \nBank. \n From 19 January 2015 onwards, the NBU was empowered by paragraph 9.4153 of Section \nII of Regulation 346 to impose fines on banks for ( inter alia )failing to comply properly with a \ncurator’s authorised requests, preventing (in whole or in part) a curator from carrying out \ntheir duties, failing to give a curator written notice of certain meetings, or failing to attend on \nthe curator. Depending on the nature of the bank’s conduct, the fine varied from 0.01% to \n1% of the registered authorised capital of the bank154. Under paragraph 12.2(3) of Section \nII of Regulation 346, the NBU was also entitled to declare a bank a “problem” bank (i.e. \nproblematic/troubled) if it failed to provide information, explanations or documents in respect \nof the bank’s operations as requested by a curator (or by the NBU or other person(s) \nauthorised by the NBU to inspect/audit the bank)155.\n I shall now consider whether the Bank’s Curator had the particular powers as identified in \nthe body of the question.  \n Alleged broad power of control.

Inaccurate information is information that is not confirmed or \ncontradicts these initial documents ”. \n155  Sub-paragraph 12.2(3) in Chapter 12 of Section II Regulation 346 (as in effect as of 19 January 2015)). \nC1/1/132\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 133 - paragraph 5.7 of Section I of Regulation 346 uses the Ukrainian word ‘ контроль’ in several \nplaces, which translates literally to ‘control’, when describing the powers of a curator (most \nnotably, paragraph 5.7(a), which describes a curator’s power “ to carry out constant control \nover any bank transactions ”)156, there is a significant difference in the meaning of the English \nword ‘control’ and the Ukrainian word ‘ контроль’.  \n I understand the English word ‘control’ to denote an ability to direct or dictate an action or \ndecision. For example, Merriam-Webster’s English Dictionary online identifies the essential \nmeaning of control as: “ 1: to direct the behaviour of (a person or animal): to cause (a person \nor animal) to do what you want … 2: to have power over (something) … 3: to direct the \nactions or function of (something): to cause (something) to act or function in a certain \nway”157.  \n The Ukrainian word ‘ контроль’ has a much broader range of meaning. Its principal meaning \nis to check, monitor or verify an action or decision, in the manner of oversight. While the \nword can have meaning akin to ‘control’ in English (i.e. to direct or dictate action), this is a \nless common, and more recently developed, usage. In the 11-volume SUM-11 dictionary, \npublished from 1970 to 1980, the word ‘ контроль’ was defined to have the following three \nmeanings: \n“1. Checking (verification), recording (accounting) the activities of someone/something, \nsupervising someone/something; \n2. An institution or organization that oversees or verifies someone, something; or \n3. [A group of controllers or a group of people/organisations exercising control]”158. \n In the updated 20-volume SUM-20 dictionary published from 2016 to 2020, the same three \nbranches of the definition of ‘ контроль’ appear, followed by a fourth meaning: \n“4. Power, the ability to dispose of something, to regulate something”159.  \n156  The Ukrainian word ‘ контроль’ is used in Regulation 346 at ( inter alia ) paragraphs 5.7(a), (h), (j) and (m).  \n157  https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/control \n158http://sum.in.ua/s/kontrolj . \n159https://1677.slovaronline.com/44163-\n%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C . For the avoidance of \ndoubt, in other laws or regulations where the word ‘ контроль’ is used, it has this fourth, less common \nmeaning. For example, in the legislation I discussed in section K above, the word ‘ контроль’ is used in \nC1/1/133\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 134 -  In the context of Regulation 346, in my view the word ‘ контроль’ must be understood to \n"}

For example, in the legislation I discussed in section K above, the word ‘ контроль’ is used in \nC1/1/133\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 134 -  In the context of Regulation 346, in my view the word ‘ контроль’ must be understood to \nhave its principal meaning of checking, monitoring or verifying. First, I consider this to be the \nordinary and principal meaning of the word in Ukrainian. Secondly, when one considers the \nparameters of the powers granted to a curator, as I have described above, it is clear (in my \nview) that they are consistent with a curator monitoring, rather than directing or dictating, the \nactions of a bank. So, for example, a curator can attend certain meetings and is entitled to \ncast an advisory vote at some of those, but cannot affect the decision-making process.  \n As Regulation 346 grants curators broad powers to monitor bank operations, but not to \n‘control’ them (in the English sense of the word), I conclude that the Curator had no such \nbroad power of control as the First Defendant alleges. \n Powers alleged at subparagraphs 32(1) to (4) of D1’s Defence. In these subparagraphs, the \nFirst Defendant describes four specific powers that he alleges are granted to curators \n(including the Curator) by Regulation 346. I consider these descriptions to be only partly \ncorrect, as I shall explain below, taking each in turn. \n First, it is alleged that Regulation 346 granted the Curator the power of “ being given access \nto the documents and electronic systems of a bank ”. At a high level, I would agree with this \nstatement, on the basis that it appears to me to be a fair shorthand description of the powers \ngranted to curators by paragraphs 5.6, 5.7(b) and 5.10 of Section I of Regulation 346. For \nthe avoidance of doubt, though, reference must be had to the actual wording of those \nparagraphs (which I have quoted above) to understand the limits of the rights of access that \nthe Curator enjoyed. For example, the rights of access granted by paragraph 5.6 are \ndelimited by the requirement that they relate to “ viewing in real time all operations of the \nbank and its clients on all accounts ”.\n Secondly, it is alleged that Regulation 346 granted the Curator the power of “ participating in \nthe Bank’s internal meetings, and an entitlement to demand clarifications from the Bank of \ndecisions taken ”. Again, I would agree with this statement only at a high-level and to the \nextent it accords with the actual wording of the Curator’s powers as set out in Regulation \n346. \nconnection with determining the circumstances in which someone can be said to have an ownership \ninterest in a company, or an ability to influence (decisively or significantly) a company’s management or \nbusiness. In those contexts, I consider the word means ‘control’ (in the fourth sense). \nC1/1/134\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 135 -  As regards the first part of this statement (meeting participation), whilst I agree that pursuant \nto paragraph 5.7(g) of Section I of Regulation 346 the Curator had certain rights to participate \nin certain internal meetings of a bank, that right was defined and limited by the wording of \nthat paragraph. Thus, the Curator had the right to attend meetings of the Bank’s general \nmeeting of shareholders, supervisory board, management board, credit committee, asset \nand liability management committee, tariff committee and management meetings, but had \nno rights of active participation save for the right to cast an “ advisory vote ” at meetings of \nthe Bank’s general meeting of shareholders, supervisory board and management board.

I \nam not aware of the term “ advisory vote ” being defined in banking law or regulation, but I \nconsider that this implies a right held by the Curator to join in discussions on an equal footing \nwith those entitled to vote at a meeting, to inform the meeting of the Curator’s own views as \nto which way an issue should be voted, and to cast a vote. But such a vote would not be \ncounted when reaching a decision. \n As regards the second part of the statement (entitlement to demand clarifications), again I \nconsider that, at a high level, the Curator did have such a power, but only to the extent \ndescribed in those paragraphs of Section I of Regulation 346 defining a curator’s rights to \ndemand, access and receive information, notably: \n paragraph 5.7(b), describing curators’ power to “ receive information, including in \nwriting, and review the documents (originals and their copies) regarding any bank \ntransactions … ”); \n paragraph 5.7(f), describing curators’ power to “ initiate meetings with the bank's \nmanagement to obtain explanations, including written, and information on the \nimplementation of measures by the bank to eliminate violations and shortcomings and \nensure its financial stability ”; and \n paragraph 5.10, describing curators’ power to demand from the Bank’s managers \n“information and explanations about the bank activities, including elimination of \nviolations of banking legislation and regulations of the [NBU], including on financial \nmonitoring ”. \n Thirdly, it is alleged that Regulation 346 granted curators the power of “ controlling the \nmanner in which funds from the NBU’s refinancing were used ”. Whilst I agree that this \nallegation substantially mirrors the wording of paragraph 5.7(j) of Section I of Regulation \nC1/1/135\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 136 - 346, for the reasons stated above, to the extent D1’s Defence uses ‘control’ or ‘controlling’ \nin its English sense (as I have explained above), I do not agree that the Curator had any \nsuch power. In my view, the Curator had only the power to monitor the manner in which \nfunds from the NBU’s refinancing were used. \n Fourthly, it is alleged that Regulation 346 grants curators the power of “ requiring compliance \nwith any financial rehabilitation plan ”. This appears to be an attempt to paraphrase the power \ngranted to the Curator by paragraph 5.7(h), quoted above, but to the extent the words \n‘requiring compliance’ are intended to suggest that the Curator herself had the power to \nenforce the Bank’s compliance with any financial rehabilitation plan, the statement is \nincorrect, since paragraph 5.7(h) only granted the Curator a power to monitor the bank’s \ncompliance with such plans. Again, paragraph 5.7(h) uses the word ‘контроль’, which does \nnot amount to “control” in the English sense of the term. As Regulation 346 makes clear \n(see for example paragraphs 2.1 and 3.1 of Section I), the power to enforce such compliance \nlies with the NBU, via the imposition of measures of influence (i.e. sanctions) as provided \nfor in Section II of Regulation 346.  \n Power to act as alleged at paragraphs 33 and 48 of D1’s Defence. Paragraph 33 of D1’s \nDefence alleges that the Curator “ supervised all of the Bank’s operations, in particular its \nloan portfolio ”, and paragraph 48 alleges that the Curator (as well as “ other NBU staff \noperating within the Bank ”): \n “supervised and controlled ” the implementation of the Transformation Plan; and \n took the following specific actions: \n“(1) reviewed the legal and credit files of all borrowers;  \n(2) determin"}

The ultimate purpose of the appointment of the curator is to exercise \nbanking supervision by the NBU over the activity of an operating bank, not to replace the \nbank’s management or permit the curator to interfere in the bank’s decision-making process. \nC1/1/137\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 138 - A curator's function is limited to the monitoring of a bank’s operations and reporting on those \noperations, including in particular regulatory and legal violations, to the NBU. \n Effect of curator’s misconduct on tort liability of bank executives.

The Supreme Court rejected this argument, stating: \n“7.64. The defendants note that the legitimacy of their actions is confirmed by the fact that \nfrom the second quarter of 2014 to the day of declaring the bank’s insolvency, the NBU \ncurator worked in the bank, who approved the execution of the relevant transactions, which \nindicates their legitimacy and absence of risks. … \n7.67. The Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court believes that any violations by the regulator \n(a curator appointed by the NBU as its representative), improper performance by the bank \ncurator of its official duties (the curator's reports did not reflect at all the information on the \nbank's management’s approval of decisions on purchasing bonds and information on the \nbank's expenditures for payment of purchased bonds) cannot serve as a basis for exemption \nfrom liability of bank officials. In fact, they, not the regulator, made the relevant decisions \nand were responsible for the activities of the bank ”.  \nM2.  During the period between the NBU’s appointment of an unscheduled inspection \nteam on 17 October 2016 and the Bank’s nationalisation on 18 December 2016, what \npowers did the inspection team have as a matter of Ukrainian law? In particular, did \nthe inspection team have the power to take the actions attributed to “ other NBU staff \noperating within the Bank ” at paragraph 48 of D1’s Defence?\n NBU Board Resolution No. 276 of 17 July 2001 approving a “Regulation on Planning and \nProcedure for Conducting Inspections” (“ Regulation 276 ”) allows the NBU to carry out both \nscheduled and unscheduled inspections of Ukrainian banks in certain specified \ncircumstances and defines the powers of inspectors (i.e. members of the inspection team). \n In particular, paragraph 4.1 of Regulation 276160 provides for inspectors to have the following \nrights and powers during an inspection: \n“4.1.

The decision to take enforcement action is not within the \ncompetence of the inspectors. \n Power to act as alleged at paragraph 48 of D1’s Defence. Paragraph 48 alleges that “ NBU \nstaff operating within the Bank ”161: \n “supervised and controlled ” implementation of the Transformation Plan; and \n took the following specific actions: \n“(1) reviewed the legal and credit files of all borrowers;  \n(2) determined whether potential new borrowers were “related parties” of the Bank;  \n(3) directed the Bank to use 36 borrowers (“the New Borrowers”) who would be granted \nnew loans which were used to repay the loans which had been made to the 193 \nBorrowers;  \n(4) oversaw the repayment by the New Borrowers of the loans outstanding to the 193 \nBorrowers; and  \n(5) were aware of the arrangements to be made to secure the loans to the New \nBorrowers ”.\n Whether or not the inspectors took these actions is a question of fact that is outside the \nscope of my evidence, but to the extent it is suggested that the inspectors had the power to \ntake these actions, then to a significant extent I would disagree.  \n As can be seen from paragraph 4.1 of Regulation 276, quoted above, the authority of \ninspectors is limited to obtaining information and documents from the bank for the purposes \nof inspecting the same and reporting to the NBU.

Paragraph 34 states that “ the Bank operated in accordance with \ninstructions from NBU’s representatives ” and refers to “ instructions given by the NBU and \nits representatives, the Curator and other officials ”. Paragraph 54 refers generally to the \nBank as “ acting under the control of the NBU ” (an allegation repeated at paragraph 55) and \nby way of example claims that “ the NBU caused the Bank to grant loans to the New \nBorrowers ” and “ the NBU caused the New Borrowers to use the funds advanced [under the \nNew Loans] to repay all the outstanding loans of the 193 Borrowers (other than the Tamersa \nLoan) ”. \n As regards the Curator and inspection team, my responses to questions M1 and M2 above \nmake clear that they had no such power to give binding instructions to and/or control the \nBank as the above paragraphs of D1’s Defence suggest. Nor did they have the power to \ninstruct the Bank to issue the New Loans or to instruct the New Borrowers in the use of the \nborrowed funds. The limited extent to which the Bank was required to act in accordance with \ninstructions given by the Curator or inspectors is defined by the powers granted to them by, \nrespectively, Regulation 346 and Regulation 276. For example, pursuant to paragraph 5.10 \nof Section I of Regulation 346, the Curator could instruct the bank to provide “ information \nand explanations about the bank activities, including elimination of violations of banking \nlegislation and regulations of the [NBU], including on financial monitoring ”. \n As regards the NBU more generally, as Ukraine’s central bank and the regulator of Ukraine’s \nbanking industry, it is of course in a position to give binding instructions to and otherwise \nexert control over banks in a variety of circumstances as provided for by law. The Law on \nthe National Bank of Ukraine (the “ NBU Law ”) and the Law on Banks grant the NBU broad \nregulatory powers including as regards the application of measures of influence (i.e. \nsanctions) upon banks (see paragraph 410 above for examples of available measures of \ninfluence). \nC1/1/142\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 143 -  The Law on Banks also grants the NBU the authority to prevent the reorganisation of a bank \nif (inter alia) “there are sufficient grounds to believe that the reorganisation threatens the \ninterests of depositors and other creditors and the bank” (Article 27(5)) and to establish \nadditional requirements for a bank, including requirements to increase the level of the bank's \nregulatory capital or other economic standards (Article 47(11))162. \n The taking of such actions in my view can be regarded as the exertion of control over a bank \nand its operations by the NBU, but the NBU can only impose sanctions on a bank in the \nevent of a violation of banking law and can only take the above actions by way of formal \nresolution.

During the period 1 January 2015 to 18 December 2016, what capital adequacy ratios \napplied to the Bank? To what extent did these capital adequacy ratios change in that \nperiod? \n Under the NBU Law and the Law on Banks, the NBU is responsible for establishing (i) \nprocedures for determining the regulatory capital of a bank, and (ii) economic standards that \nare binding on all banks, such as the standard regulatory capital adequacy ratio (N2). \n NBU Board Resolution No. 368 of 28 August 2001 approving the Instruction on Banking \nRegulation Procedures in Ukraine (“ Regulation 368 ”) establishes the procedure for \ndetermining the regulatory capital of a bank and economic standards, which is mandatory \nfor all banks. In particular, those standards include the minimum regulatory capital ratio (N1 \nunder Regulation 368)163, the regulatory capital adequacy ratio (CAR or N2 ratio under \n162  Version in effect as of 1 April 2016. \n163 The minimum amount of the regulatory capital of a bank (N1) that obtained a banking license after 11 July \n2014 must be UAH 500 million. The minimum amount of the regulatory capital of a bank (N1) that received \na banking license before 11 July 2014 must be: UAH 120 million - until 17 June 2016; UAH 200 million - \nfrom 11 July 2017; UAH 300 million – from 11  July 2018; UAH 400 million - from 11 July 11 2019; UAH \n450 million - from 11 July 2020; UAH 500 million - from 11 July 2024 (see Paragraph 2.1-2.2 of Chapter 2 \nof Section II of Regulation 368 (as in effect as of 4 June 2016). \nC1/1/143\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 144 - Regulation 368) and the core capital adequacy ratio (CCR or N3 ratio under Regulation \n368). \n Regulation 368 establishes that the regulatory capital of a bank is the aggregate of equity \ncapital164 and additional capital165 ,166. Regulatory capital is one of the most important \nindicators of banks’ performance, the main purpose of which is to ensure the protection of \ndeposits, financial stability and stable operations of banks, and therefore to ensure that the \nnegative consequences of risks are adequately covered.  \n The components of the N2 ratio are described in Regulation 368. In summary, it is the ratio \nof a bank’s regulatory capital to its total assets (and certain off-balance sheet instruments), \nweighted by the degree of credit risk, and taking into account the effect of certain additional \nfactors such as the reserves already formed for active banking operations and the bank’s \nopen currency position. The precise methodology for calculating the N2 ratio is a question \nof accounting and/or finance. \n In effect, as stated in Regulation 368, the N2 ratio reflects the bank's ability to fully and in a \ntimely manner pay off its obligations arising from trade, credit or other transactions of a \nmonetary nature.

Paragraph 1.5, \nChapter 1, Section IV of Regulation 368 specifies that the standard level of N2 must be at \nleast 10% for active banks.  \n The N3 ratio is defined as the ratio of the equity capital to the sum of assets and off-balance \nsheet liabilities weighted by the corresponding credit risk ratios.

Until that time, Resolution 260 established a schedule for bringing the N3 ratio up \nto at least 7%. \n As I will now explain, following the economic crisis in Ukraine in 2014, changes were made \nto the law to make certain allowances for banks that were unable to meet the required capital \nadequacy ratios, on the condition that they subsequently improved their capital adequacy \nratios to gradually meet the required levels, through restructuring, recapitalisation or \nreorganisation.  \n First, on 30 December 2014, the Law on Measures Aimed at Promoting Capitalization and \nRestructuring of Banks (“ Law 78 ”) was adopted with the aim of ensuring the stable operation \nof Ukrainian banks, strengthening the financial capacity of the banking system of Ukraine \nand minimizing the negative impact of the occupation of Crimea.  \n As of its enactment date, Law 78 prescribed that a bank that required additional capital (as \nidentified by a diagnostic study) was required to carry out recapitalisation, restructuring \nand/or reorganisation to ensure that the bank satisfied the Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio (i.e. \nN3) of at least 7%, while it was to satisfy the standard regulatory capital adequacy ratio (i.e. \nN2) of at least 10% and the Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio calculated based on baseline and \npessimistic macroeconomic scenarios (i.e. stress tests) of at least 4.5%, respectively, for \nthe period of 2014 to 2016.

According to Article 1(3) of Law 78, \nif the bank failed to submit a bank capitalisation programme/restructuring plan that would \nsatisfy the NBU’s requirements, or if the bank’s members were unable to procure the \nappropriate capitalisation level, the NBU should: \n provide the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers with a proposal to ensure the capitalization \nof the bank by the state (i.e., propose a solvent nationalisation); or\n declare the bank insolvent, either resulting in the re-organisation of the bank (e.g. \nthrough merger with a solvent bank); the liquidation of the bank; or the insolvent \nnationalisation of the bank.\n Furthermore, as I mentioned above, under paragraph 9-1 of Article 8 of Law 78, the NBU \nshould not classify the bank as problematic or insolvent on certain grounds of Article 75 \n(1)176 and Article 76 (1)177 of the Law on Banks, subject to (a) the submission by the bank to \nthe NBU of a capitalization programme / restructuring plan, drawn up, inter alia , based on \nthe results of a diagnostic study, as well as an action plan to bring the bank's activities into \ncompliance with the requirements of the legislation on transactions with persons related to \nthe bank; and (b) the implementation of these programmes / plans within the time frame \nspecified by them. Thus, it is only if a bank fails to ensure the timely implementation of these \nprogrammes / plans that the NBU should classify the bank as problematic or insolvent.  \n As I have explained above, Appendix 2 to Resolution 260 set out the NBU’s deadlines for \n20 banks to reach certain N2 and N3 ratios (the remaining Ukrainian banks being subject to \nthe deadlines in Resolution 129).

Further, under \nparagraph 7(1) of the Resolution 260 the Banking Supervision Department of the NBU \nshould submit proposals to the Board of the NBU/Commission as regards taking adequate \nactions against banks if the banks fail to comply with the requirements of Resolution 260, or \nsubmit capitalisation programmes / restructuring plans that do not comply with the \nrequirements of the NBU, or if they fail to perform (or perform improperly) the planned \nmeasures within the time established by Resolution 260 or by the capitalization programmes \n/ restructuring plans approved by the Board of the NBU. \n Thus, if a bank failed to comply with the restructuring plan or capitalisation programme, the \nNBU was entitled to apply measures of influence to the bank. The applicable list of measures \nof influence is contained in Article 73 of the Law on Banks (see paragraph 410 above); these \nmeasures include the classification of a bank as insolvent). The NBU has the right to apply \nmeasures of influence proportionate to the committed violation180. As such, I believe that in \ncase of the Bank’s failure to comply with the restructuring plan (including by breaching \ndeadlines set out in the plan), and/or in the case of a breach of the deadlines under \nResolution 260, the NBU had the right to apply any measures of influence provided for in \nArticle 73 of the Banking Law, at its discretion, assessing the adequacy of such measures \nof influence in each specific case up to the declaration of Bank’s insolvency. \nM7.  During the period 2013 to 2016, what limits did Regulation 368 place on banks’ lending \nto certain counterparties or groups of counterparties, including related parties? \n The bank's regulatory capital is the basis for calculating not only the economic ratio N2, but \nalso the ratio of the maximum amount of credit risk per counterparty (N7), the ratio of large \ncredit risks (N8) and the ratio of the maximum amount of credit risk for related party \n178  Section I of Appendix 3 to Resolution 260. \n179  Section I of Appendix 3 to Resolution 260. \n180  Article 73 of the Law on Banks. \nC1/1/151\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 152 - transactions (N9).

During the period 2013 to 2016, what criteria did pledges over contractual rights to \nreceive goods have to meet (both as a specific category of collateral and more \ngenerally) in order to be considered eligible for the purpose of calculating credit risk \nand required loan provisions pursuant to applicable NBU regulations? \n As I have explained above, the calculation of a bank’s N2 ratio is the ratio of its regulatory \ncapital to its total assets (and certain off-balance sheet instruments), weighted by the degree \nof credit risk, and taking into account the effect of certain additional factors. Since loans are \nrelated to the bank's assets, the quality of collateral for any lending affects the valuation of \nsuch loans for the purposes of calculating the Bank’s total assets.

In other words, the lower \nthe value or quality of collateral, the higher a bank’s credit risks and the lower its N2 ratio. \nWhere a bank’s N2 ratio is low, as I have already explained, credit risks are shifted on to \ndepositors/creditors of the bank rather than on its shareholders. That is why the NBU, in its \nresolutions, established requirements for collateral for credit operations that were \nconsidered acceptable. \n184  See paragraph 3.9 of Chapter 3 of Section VI of Regulation 368 (as in effect as of 4 June 2016). \n185  See Paragraph 1-2 of Chapter 4 of Section VI of Regulation 368 (as in effect as of 4 June 2016). \n186  See paragraph 9 of Chapter 4 of Section VI of Regulation 368 (as in effect as of 4 June 2016). Please note \nthat the normative value of the N9 ratio in the amount of 25% is in effect as of 14 June 2015 (as amended \nby Resolutions of the National Bank No 312 of 12 May 2015).  Prior to 14 June 2015, the N9 ratio related \nto the maximum claims of the bank against / all financial liabilities provided by the bank in relation to a \nsingle related party, and the limit on that ratio was 5%. Prior to 14 June 2015, it was the N10 ratio that \nrelated to the maximum claims of the bank to / all financial liabilities provided by the bank in relation to all \nrelated parties, and the limit on that ratio was 30%. \nC1/1/153\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 154 -  On 25 January 2012, the NBU Board approved Regulation 23 (I have introduced and \ndiscussed Regulation 23 in response to question E7 above). Regulation 23 set down \nrequirements for security that was eligible for the purpose of calculating credit risk. \n Regulation 23 listed certain types of collateral that could in principle be the subject of eligible \nsecurity for the purpose of calculating credit risk (subject to the requirements noted below). \nThis list excluded some forms of security altogether, for example pledges over corporate \nrights, but did include pledges over rights to receive goods, albeit only in the lowest liquidity \ngroup, as I explain below.  \n Under Regulation 23, eligible types of security for a bank were subdivided into five groups, \ndepending on liquidity levels. The forms of collateral with the lowest acceptable liquidity level \nwere in Group V. Group V included rights187 in other property (e.g. products, goods, and \nreceipts of cash (proceeds of sale) under agreements made to sell goods/perform \nworks/provide services) that would become the property of a pledgor after the execution of \nthe pledge agreement (except for rights to services, processes, works, intellectual property, \nequity interests, unextracted minerals, or options)”188. Thus, Regulation 23 recognised rights \nto other property (eg rights to receive goods), within Group V.  \n Regulation 23 also specified further requirements that all potentially eligible security was \nrequired to satisfy, in order to be factored in to calculations of credit risk: \n“a) the pledge agreement defines the right of the bank to sell the pledge or acquire its \nownership in case of default of the debtor under the loan agreement and / or initiation of \nbankruptcy proceedings of the [pledgor]; \nb) the pledge is not valued higher than the market (fair) value, which should provide the \npossibility of selling the pledge to a third party buyer; \nc) the bank reviews the value of collateral taking into account changes in market conditions \nand the state of their preservation at least once every twelve months for real estate, \nequipment and vehicles, or once every six months - for other property; \nd) the presence in the bank of documents indicating th"}

What this actually refers to is \na right to receive property, such as pursuant to a contract. \n188  Paragraph 4.2.5 in Chapter 4 of Section II of Regulation 23 (as in effect as of 29 December 2012)). Until \n29 December 2012, rights to other property were included in Group IV.  \nC1/1/154\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 155 - e) the bank has documentary evidence of the grounds for expecting cash flows from \ncollateral ”189. \n Further, Regulation 23 provided that security should not be considered for the calculation of \ncredit risk if, inter alia : \n“a credit operation, the collateral for which belongs to groups II - V in accordance with clause \n4.2 of this chapter, is assigned to the V (the lowest) quality category190 for more than three \nconsecutive years”; \n“the bank does not have documents certifying the registration of the encumbrance on the \ncollateral in favour of the bank”; \n“the right of the creditor bank to recover the collateral is challenged in court”; \n“a bankruptcy case has been initiated against the [pledgor] (debtor/property guarantor) or \nhe has been declared bankrupt in accordance with the procedure established by the \nlegislation of Ukraine”; \n“the bank does not check the condition of the collateral or does not have documents \nconfirming the availability and current status of collateral” ; or\n“the bank does not fulfill other collateral [related] requirements specified in the \nRegulations ”191. \n The quality of security (in particular, the liquidity of the collateral) also affects the provisions \nthat banks must make for credit operations, as determined by the security liquidity ratio \nspecified in Regulation 23. As I have explained above, collateral that is of an eligible type is \ndivided into five groups192, depending on the level of liquidity. The liquidity ratio for Security \nGroup V (which includes rights to other property) is 0.4, which is the lowest of the ratios for \nthe five eligible groups of security. The security liquidity ratio is the highest for Security Group \nI, at 1; for Group II it is 0.8; for Group III it is 0.7; and for Group IV it is 0.5193.  \n In summary, the required provisions for loans under Regulation 23 amount to the excess of \nthe book value of the loan over the present value of the estimated future cash flows on the \n189  Sub-paragraph (e) of Paragraph 4.1 in Chapter 4 of Section II of Regulation 23 “ the bank has documentary \nevidence of the grounds for expecting cash flows from collatera l” was in effect since 30 January 2016.  \n190  A bank classifies a loan (made available to a debtor) within the quality classes based on both the class \nassigned to the (corporate or individual) debtor and the debt service status. Quality depends on the risk \nlevel for the loan. \n191  Paragraph 4.13 in Chapter 4 of Section II of Regulation 23 (as in effect as of 29 December 2012). \n192  Paragraph 4.2 in Chapter 4 of Section II of Regulation 23 (as in effect as of 29 December 2012). \n193  Paragraph 4.14 in Chapter 4 of Section II of Regulation 23 (as in effect as of 29 December 2012). \nC1/1/155\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 156 - loan.

The present value of the estimated future cash flows on the loan is determined by a \ncalculation that involves (among other things) multiplying the liquidity ratio of the collateral \nby the future cash flow from the sale of collateral194. In effect, the more liquid the form of \nsecurity, the higher the security liquidity ratio, and the lower the provision that a bank is \nrequired to make for the secured loan.  \nM9.  What was the effect of the guidance issued by the Coordination Committee on Bank \nDiagnostics Monitoring and Control regarding rights to goods as collateral on 29 \nSeptember 2015?\n The 29 September 2015 minutes (the “ Minutes ”) of the Coordination Committee on Bank \nDiagnostics Monitoring and Control specified that, in accordance with the requirements of \nRegulation 23, rights to other goods may constitute eligible loan security only if the future \ncash flows expected from the security of that type are supported by a prepayment for those \ngoods. Similarly, rights to future proceeds may be eligible security only to the extent of the \namounts comparable to the income earned by the business entity borrowers in the previous \ncalendar year, i.e. the bank’s expectations of such cash flows are supported by historical \ndata195. \n Considering the wording of the Minutes, I believe that they are clarifications and guidance \nand do not seek either to change the wording of Regulation 23, nor to establish any new \nobligations on banks for the purposes of calculating credit risk under it. In reaching this \nconclusion, I rely on the wording of the Minutes, from which it is apparent that the meeting \nwas held with the purpose of optimising the diagnostics process, and the resolution of the \nCoordination Committee on Bank Diagnostics Monitoring and Control, which was set out in \nthe Minutes, was specifically related to the diagnostic studies on banks conducted by the \nNBU. In other words, I believe that the Minutes provided practical guidance as to how the \nNBU, during the diagnostic studies of banks, should assess the eligibility of security for the \npurpose of those studies, according to Resolutions 129 and 260. As set out in Resolution \n260, the purpose of the diagnostic studies was to determine the necessary scope of \nadditional capitalization for banks, to increase the stability of Ukraine’s banking system and \nprotect the interests of creditors and depositors. \n194  Paragraph 1.3 of Chapter 1 of Section II of Regulation 23 (as in effect as of 29 December 2012). \n195  The 29 September 2015 minutes of the Coordination Committee on Bank Diagnostics Monitoring and \nControl. \nC1/1/156\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 157 - M10.

Paragraph 7 of Resolution 351, which declared \nRegulation 23 no longer in effect, came into force on 3 January 2017, from which point banks \nwere obliged to calculate credit risk only in accordance with the new Regulation 351.  \n As such, the abovementioned provisions set a so-called transition period during which banks \nwere supposed to make a gradual transition from the Regulation 23 requirements to those \nof Regulation 351. Both Regulation 23 and Regulation 351 could therefore be used by banks \nfor credit risk measurement until 3 January 2017. \n In general, Regulation 351 was based on the principles and recommendations offered by \nthe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, for example requiring that banks look at \n“substance over form ” with respect to banking transactions196, and that they consider a wide \nrange of objective factors when conducting credit risk assessment. Departing from the \nposition under Regulation 23, Regulation 351 excluded pledges over rights to receive goods \nfrom the list of acceptable security entirely (although pledges over rights to receive funds \nand pledges over goods were still treated as acceptable security, subject to their satisfaction \nof the remaining criteria in Regulation 351). As of today, pledges over rights to receive goods \nremain excluded from the list of acceptable collateral under Regulation 351. \n196  It stipulates that a bank must ensure the full and adequate assessment of credit risk in its calculation of \nthe credit risk of an asset on both an individual and consolidated basis; it must set economically reasonable \nintervals and amounts for a debtor/counterparty to pay his debt. \nC1/1/157\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 158 - N.

Both \nthe rulings granting the Injunctions197 and the rulings discharging them were appealed in \nseparate appeal proceedings, with the First Defendant taking the position that the \nInjunctions remained in effect during the pendency of the respondents’ appeals from the \nrulings granting the Injunctions.

Each case was then remanded \nto the respective District Court to consider the First Defendant’s underlying substantive \nclaims (as opposed to the Injunctions themselves); those proceedings have yet to be finally \nresolved. \n On the basis of my review of the Statements of Claim and the Injunctions, I consider the \nclaims underlying the Injunctions to be without merit and the Injunctions themselves to have \nbeen contrary to Ukrainian law in a number of respects, as follows.  \n Illegal restraint of the NBU.

The Injunctions purported to restrain the Bank \nfrom giving instructions to the law firms Hogan Lovells and Asters, and purported to restrain \nthose firms from taking action pursuant to their respective engagement agreements with the \nBank199. In my view, this also clearly contradicted Ukrainian law. \n According to Article 55 of the Constitution of Ukraine, a person’s rights and legitimate \ninterests are to be protected by the courts. Under Article 4 of the Civil Procedure Code, \nArticle 4 of the Code of Commercial Procedure and Article 5 of the Code of Administrative \nJustice, no one may be deprived of his right to apply to the court to seek protection of his \nrights and legitimate interests. Any waiver of one’s right to apply to the court is invalid. These \nprovisions of the Constitution and Codes are in line with Article 6 of the ECHR, to which \nUkraine is a party and which therefore forms part of Ukrainian law (as I explained in section \nC above).  \n Under Articles 2, 6 and 7 of the Law of Ukraine “On Court System and Status of Judges”, \nUkrainian courts must uphold the principle of the rule of law and must uphold the right to a \n198  See also Article 74 of the NBU Law: “ An appeal against a decision, act or action of the National Bank of \nUkraine shall not suspend its execution. Securing a claim by suspending decisions, acts of the National \nBank of Ukraine, as well as establishing a ban or obligation for the National Bank of Ukraine to perform \ncertain actions is not allowed ”. \n199  I note that the prohibition was not absolute, but rather caught only actions that “ directly and/or indirectly \nconcern and/or in any manner influence and/or will influence the rights and/or lawful interests of [the First \nDefendant] ”. This proviso, however, does not affect my view that such a restraint is contrary to Ukrainian \nlaw. \nC1/1/160\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 161 - fair trial guaranteed by the Constitution and legislation of Ukraine, as well as by international \ntreaties ratified by Ukraine.  \n The Supreme Court in its Resolution No. 9, dated 1 November 1996, “ On application of the \nConstitution of Ukraine in the course of administration of justice ”, held that:  \n“Since the Constitution of Ukraine, as it is stated in its Article 8, has the highest legal force \nand its norms are the rules of direct action, the courts while considering specific cases shall \nevaluate the content of any law or another regulative act in the context of its compliance with \nthe Constitution and in all necessary cases shall apply the Constitution as an act of direct \naction. Judicial decisions shall be based on the Constitution, as well as on the current \nlegislation, which does not contradict it”.\n In my view, the above provisions of Ukrainian law and court practice between them make \nclear that any injunction, or other judgment, issued by a Ukrainian court must be consistent \nwith the provisions of the Ukrainian Constitution, Ukrainian legislation, and the ECHR. To \nthe extent that the Injunctions purported to restrict the ability of the Bank to instruct lawyers \nto bring claims to court to protect the Bank’s rights and legitimate interests, in my view they \nwere contrary to the Bank’s fundamental rights as guaranteed by the above-mentioned laws. \nIn particular, the Injunctions purported to prevent the Bank from exercising its right to bring \na c"}

To \nthe extent that the Injunctions purported to restrict the ability of the Bank to instruct lawyers \nto bring claims to court to protect the Bank’s rights and legitimate interests, in my view they \nwere contrary to the Bank’s fundamental rights as guaranteed by the above-mentioned laws. \nIn particular, the Injunctions purported to prevent the Bank from exercising its right to bring \na claim against the First Defendant in any jurisdiction (and did not merely, for example, \nrestrain the Bank from bringing duplicative proceedings against the First Defendant in \nmultiple jurisdictions, which itself would be contrary to Ukrainian law). \n Reliance on obsolete law. At several places, each Injunction refers to the version of the Law \nof Ukraine “On State Procurement” that is said to have been “ in force at the time of drawing \nup of the disputed contracts ”. However, I am instructed that the Bank’s engagement \nagreement with Hogan Lovells is dated 7 August 2017, whereas the Law on State \nProcurement referenced in the Injunctions was repealed and ceased to have effect on 1 \nAugust 2016, after which it was replaced by a new Law on Public Procurement (the “ Public\nProcurement Law ”) (Section IX(1),(5) of the Public Procurement Law). So, to the extent \nthat the Injunctions were based on the claim that the Bank’s engagement agreement with \nHogan Lovells (or any other agreement between the respondents post-dating 1 August \n2016) was entered into in breach of the Law on State Procurement, each of them relied on \nobsolete law.  \nC1/1/161\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 162 -  Bank not subject to Public Procurement Law. The Preamble to the Public Procurement Law \nstates that it establishes the legal and economic principles for procuring goods, works and \nservices to satisfy the demands of the state or a local community. Article 1(9) of the Public \nProcurement law defines “ customers ” (i.e. those buying services for which a procurement \nprocess is required) to mean state authorities, local authorities and social insurance bodies \nformed in accordance with the law, as well as legal entities that satisfy the demand of the \nstate or a local community, unless such activities are carried out on an industrial or \ncommercial basis.  \n The 2017 Charters show that the Bank carries out its activities on a commercial basis, i.e. \nin order to earn a profit. For example, Article 2.3 states that the Bank “ shall own: monetary \nfunds transferred to it by the founders and shareholders of the Bank as contributions to its \nauthorized capital; ... income and property received by the Bank as a result of financial, \nbusiness and banking activities in Ukraine and abroad ...” , and Article states “ [t]he purposes \n(objectives) of the Bank shall include the conduct of banking activities aimed at earning \nprofits for its own development and in the interests of the owner ”.  \n As such, even if the Injunctions had referred to the Public Procurement Law (rather than the \nobsolete Law on State Procurement), the Public Procurement Law was not applicable to the \nBank. The allegation that the Bank breached that Law could not, therefore, provide a proper \nbasis for the Injunctions. \n Lack of standing to seek injunctive relief. Each of the Injunctions recites that the First \nDefendant, by his underlying substantive claims, seeks to invalidate a number of \nagreements entered into between the respondents, including the engagement agreement \nentered into between the Bank and Hogan Lovells. I am instructed that the First Defendant \nis not a party to any of those agreements.  \n The Injunctions refer to only two bases upon which the First Defendant seeks to invalidate \nthese agreements: (i) that the Ukrainian parties to the agreements did not follow proper \nprocurement procedures, and (ii) that performance of the agreements will lead to the \n“unlaw"}

The Statements of Claim \nrefer to a third possible basis for invaliding these agreements, namely (iii) that “ State \nsecrets ”, which are not identified, were provided by the Bank, NBU or Ministry of Finance to \nthe counterparties to those agreements, including Hogan Lovells. \nC1/1/162\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 163 -  Under Ukrainian law, a third party to an agreement can bring an action to invalidate it \nprovided that they show a sufficient legal interest in that agreement (Article 215(3) of the \nCivil Code). Here, even assuming that the agreements that the First Defendant seeks to \ninvalidate did in fact violate applicable procurement procedures, I do not see that this fact \nalone would provide the First Defendant with any interest in the agreements or standing to \nchallenge their validity. I reach the same conclusion in respect of the allegation in the \nStatement of Claim that there has been a dissemination of State secrets; the First Defendant \nis a private citizen who, in my view, is in no position to say what is or is not a State secret or \nwhat if anything is to be done about an alleged dissemination by some other party. \n Accordingly, the only basis upon which it appears that the First Defendant might have \nstanding to invalidate the identified agreements and restrain their performance by injunction, \nappears to be his alleged concern that performance of the agreements would lead to the \nunlawful processing of his personal data.  \n From this premise, the Injunctions are highly unsatisfactory. Nowhere is there any recitation \nor finding by either court that indicates what personal data (or type of personal data) the \nFirst Defendant believes was at risk of being processed, nor how such processing would be \nunlawful. Whilst the First Injunction refers to media articles speculating that personal data of \nthe Bank’s clients was transferred to Kroll Associates UK Limited, and from there allegedly \nto Russia, it does not indicate that the First Defendant himself was a client of the Bank, and \nmakes no reference to any evidence of personal data being transferred to Hogan Lovells. \nThe Injunctions, therefore, fail to refer to any facts substantiating the First Defendant’s \nalleged concern that his personal data had been transferred to Hogan Lovells or was at risk \nof being used, nor do they at least prima facie establish that the alleged (but unidentified) \nuse of the First Defendant’s personal data was or risked being unlawful. Thus, in my view, \nno good basis was presented for the court to have concluded that the First Defendant had \nstanding to seek to invalidate the engagement agreement between the Bank and Hogan \nLovells (or, indeed, any of the other agreements between the respondents), or to seek \ninjunctive relief in relation thereto. \n Injunctive relief disproportionate to claims advanced. Under Article 150(3) of the Code of \nCivil Procedure, the types of security ordered by a court in respect of a claim, including \ninjunctive relief, must be proportionate to the claims advanced. Under Article 12(3) of the \nC1/1/163\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 164 - Code of Civil Procedure, the applicant seeking an injunction is obligated to furnish evidence \nshowing that the relief sought is proportionate to the claims advanced. \n Once the apparent basis for the First Defendant’s injunction requests is clear, in my view it \n"}

Whilst the last branch of each Injunction, which aims to restrain the \nrespondents from using the First Defendant’s personal data, at least bears some relation to \nthe basis of the First Defendant’s complaint, the remainder of each Injunction does not.  \n Instead, in very wide terms, the Injunctions purported to prohibit any performance of the \nrespondents’ agreements, which “ directly and/or indirectly concern[s] and/or in any manner \ninfluence[s] and/or will influence the rights and/or lawful interests of [the First Defendant] ”, \nand to prohibit the making of any payment in relation to such performance. This relief seems \nto me to be clearly disproportionate, and indeed unrelated, to any concern about personal \ndata.  \n Furthermore, the fact that the Injunctions purported to restrain not only the respondent law \nfirms and service providers from providing services to the Bank, NBU or Ministry of Finance, \nbut also “ any other persons ” from doing so, further illustrates their wholly disproportionate \nnature, especially as the First Defendant’s claims do not articulate any purported basis for \nenjoining any person other than the named respondents.  \n I also believe that the restraint on use of the First Defendant’s personal data envisaged by \nthe Injunctions was in any event overbroad and disproportionate, because no exception or \ncarve-out for uses of personal data that are clearly lawful under Ukrainian law was provided \nfor. In particular, Article 11(1)(6) of the Law on Personal Data Protection states that the \naccepted grounds for use of personal data include “ the need to protect the legitimate \ninterests of… a third person to whom personal data is transmitted, except when the \nprotection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the subject of personal data in \nconnection with the processing of his data outweigh such interests ”. Indeed, even in the \ncase of certain sensitive personal data (such as data about one’s ethnic origin, religious \nbeliefs, criminal convictions, sex life and the like), Article 7(5) of the Law of Personal Data \nProtection permits its use where this is “ required to substantiate a legal claim ”, without \nqualification. Accordingly, there was no lawful basis for the injunctions to limit, whether \nexpressly or impliedly, the Bank’s use of the First Defendant’s personal data for the purpose \nof protecting its legitimate interests and substantiating its legal claims. Yet the injunctions \nC1/1/164\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 165 - purported to restrict the use of personal data by the Bank’s lawyers, which suggests that it \nwas directed at limiting the Bank’s ability to take legal action to protect its interests, contrary \nto the express provisions of the Law on Personal Data Protection. \n No fortification of First Injunction. Under Article 159(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, \nrespondents to an interim relief order are entitled to damages caused by that order if the \nclaim is subsequently dismissed or proceedings on the claim are subsequently discontinued. \nUnder Article 154(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, when issuing an order for interim relief, \nthe court may require that the applicant fortify its duty to compensate the respondents of the \ninterim relief order by depositing an amount by way of countersecurity with the court. \nMoreover, the court is required to order s"}

The amount of \nthe deposit shall be determined by the court taking into consideration all the circumstances \nof the case, but shall be proportionate to the interim relief imposed and the loss that the \nrespondents of the interim relief could suffer as a result of the order (Article 154(5) of the \nCode of Civil Procedure). \n Here, however, the Solomyanskiy District Court did not order the First Defendant to provide \nany countersecurity notwithstanding (i) the wide scope and onerous effect of the First \nInjunction, (ii) the fact that the First Defendant gave a Swiss address as his only residence \nin his Statement of Claim. Indeed, the First Injunction contains no indication that the issue \nof fortification was considered by the judge at all. \n In relation to the Second Injunction, fortification was ordered but in the amount of only UAH \n100,000 (c. USD 3,500).  \n Misrepresentation to the Odesa court. In relation to the Second Injunction, the First \nDefendant appears to have seriously misled the court when making his claim. As noted \nabove, save for a discrete defamation claim against ARS TV, the First Defendant’s \nStatement of Claim in the Kyivskiy District Court essentially repeats the very same claims \nand the very same requested relief that he earlier made (and is still pursuing) in the \nSolomyanskiy District Court of Kyiv. Yet the First Defendant stated in his claim to the \nKyivskiy District Court of Odesa that: “ The Claimant confirms that he has not filed any other \nclaim(s) against the Respondents on the same subject matter and the same grounds which \nexist in this case ”. \nC1/1/165\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 166 -  The First Defendant was required by law to provide this statement as part of his Statement \nof Claim (Article 175(3)(10) of the Code of Civil Procedure); however, insofar as it relates to \nall of the respondents save ARS TV, it was untrue, since nearly a month earlier he had \nalready submitted the same claims seeking the same relief to the Solomyanskiy District \nCourt in Kyiv. This was not an immaterial omission. If the Kyivskiy District Court of Odesa \nhad not been misled, but had instead been told that the First Defendant had made identical \nclaims against all but one of the defendants, seeking identical relief, just a few weeks earlier \nin Kyiv, it would have been bound to refuse to accept the First Defendant’s Statement of \nClaim as against all defendants (except ARS TV) pursuant to Article 186(1)(3) of the Code \nof Civil Procedure, which requires a court to refuse to initiate proceedings on a claim if the \nclaimant has already submitted a claim against the same parties on the same subject matter \nand grounds to a different court. This would, of course, have prevented the Odesa court \nfrom granting the Second Injunction. \n Abuse of process. Not only did the First Defendant seriously mislead the Odesa court, the \nvery fact of submitting such a claim was an abuse of process. Articles 44(2)(2) and (3) of \nthe Code of Civil Procedure expressly prohibit, as an abuse of process, the submission of \nseveral duplicative (identical or analogous) claims to the court and/or otherwise manifestly \nunfounded or artificial claims. \n In addition, the claim brought against ARS TV i"}

The story continues … ”, and it bears no relationship to the claims brought \nagainst the other defendants (which as noted above relate to the provision of legal and other \nservices to the Bank, NBU and Ministry of Finance by various professional advisors). ARS \nTV is the only one of the defendants identified as being located in Odesa and I consider it \nlikely that it was named as a defendant by Mr Kolomoisky solely to create a purported basis \nfor bringing these proceedings in Odesa. This provides a further reason for concluding that \nthis claim constitutes an abuse of process under Articles 44(2)(2) and (3) of the Code of Civil \nProcedure. Indeed, on 18 October 2018, the Kyivskiy District Court of Odesa struck out the \nFirst Defendant’s Statement of Claim on this basis, although on 14 April 2021 this ruling was \noverturned by the Odesa Court of Appeal on procedural grounds. I am instructed that the \nBank’s cassation appeal of this ruling remains pending before the Supreme Court.  \nC1/1/166\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 167 - b) do any other reasons exist for doubting the bona fides  of the Injunctions? \n In my opinion, the provisions of Ukrainian law that I have referred to above would be well \nknown to any Ukrainian judge. Moreover, even if these provisions of law were not specifically \nreferred to the judge by the party seeking the injunctions, in a civil law system such as exists \nin Ukraine, judges are not constrained to consider and apply only the provisions of law to \nwhich they are referred. Yet the rulings granting the Injunctions did not refer to these laws, \nnor explain on what basis each of the judges felt able to grant an injunction that, for example, \npurported to enjoin the NBU and to restrict the Bank’s ability to instruct lawyers to bring \nclaims to court aimed at protecting its rights and interests. I am unable to conceive of \ncircumstances in which a Ukrainian judge acting bona fide would regard themselves as able \nto grant an injunction contrary to the laws that I have set out above.  \n In addition to the apparent (in my view, clear) illegality of the Injunctions, I consider that the \nfollowing further matters provide additional reason for doubting the bona fides of the \nInjunctions. \n Judge Kizyun’s prior record. The First Injunction was granted by Judge Lyudmila Ivanova \nKizyun of the Solomyanskiy District Court of Kyiv. When I first received and read the First \nInjunction, in December 2017, the identity of the judge stood out to me. It was well known \nwithin the Kyiv litigation community at the time that Judge Kizyun recently had been found \nby the Public Integrity Council200 not to have met judicial standards of integrity and \nprofessional ethics. The Public Integrity Council’s conclusions about Judge Kizyun were \nreached in the context of considering her for a seat on the Supreme Court and were based \non a number of incidents of dishonest or unethical behaviour: \n In June 2015, a ruling by Judge Kizyun in a pre-trial detention case was found to contain \n“elements of oath-breaking ” and a disciplinary case was opened against her as a result \nof which it was recommended that she be removed as a judge.

More specifically, as found by the Public Integrity Council, \nin 2011 Judge Kizyun declared property maintenance expenses whilst at the same time \nfailing to declare ownership of any property, and then in later declarations she referred \nto properties which she claimed to have owned since 2006. Judge Kizyun also failed to \ndeclare a vehicle owned by her husband. \n Judge Kizyun claimed that her international travel during 2014-2017 was partly financed \nby “help from her parents ”, but the Public Integrity Council compared her parents’ \nannual income against her travel costs and found this claim dubious; moreover, it \nreferred to the Judge’s statement that during this time most of her income was being \nused to repay a loan, and concluded that “ the Candidate’s lifestyle did not correspond \nto her income ”. \n As a result of these matters, the Public Integrity Council concluded that Judge Kizyun did \n“not meet the criteria of integrity and professional ethics ”. \n Judge Kizyun’s subsequent removal from office. Following the First Injunction, a disciplinary \ninvestigation was opened into Judge Kizyun’s decision to grant the same and, on 1 August \n2018, the Third Disciplinary Chamber of the High Justice Council ruled that Judge Kizyun \nshould be removed from her position as a judge201. The ruling included findings that the First \nInjunction was unlawful and obviously so, that it had interfered with the protection of the \nBank’s interests in these proceedings in England, and that the judge had acted “ intentionally ” \nwhen granting it. Following unsuccessful attempts to appeal this ruling, Judge Kizyun was \nremoved from office on 2 April 2019. Judge Kizyun has since petitioned the Supreme Court \nto reverse her removal from office; her claim remains pending.  \n Judge Kurylenko’s judicial record.

In relation to the loan enforcement claims initiated in December 2017 by the Ukrainian \nGeneral Prosecutor’s Office (“GPO”) against five of the New Borrowers, was there \nany justification in Ukrainian law or procedure for the joinder of the English Suppliers \nas third parties to the proceedings? \n By way of background, in December 2017, prior to the Bank’s initiation of these proceedings, \nthe GPO, acting on behalf of the Bank purportedly pursuant to the GPO’s authority to act in \nthe interests of the Ukrainian State, commenced five separate proceedings in the Ukrainian \ncourts seeking to enforce the loan agreements entered into between the Bank and five of \nthe New Borrowers (Dream Company LLC, Business Prom Innovation LLC, Like City LLC, \nBorand Trade LLC and Khromiia LLC) as part of the Transformation (the “ GPO \nProceedings ”). I am familiar with the GPO Proceedings, having considered them for \n202     http://Odesamedia.net/news/sudya-kurilenko-prinyala-besprecedentnoe-reshenie-ob-annulirovanii-\ndogovora-kupli-prodaji/. \nC1/1/169\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 170 - purposes of my prior expert reports in these proceedings, and I am aware that the Bank \nobjected to these claims and eventually they were withdrawn by the GPO.  \n Ukrainian procedural law allows third parties, i.e. persons other than the claimant(s) and \ndefendant(s), to be added to proceedings in circumstances where judgment in the \nproceedings may affect their rights or obligations. Any party to proceedings can seek to add \nthird parties to the claim. In summary, there are two types of third parties to a claim: \n third parties who have their own independent claims in relation to the subject matter of \nthe proceedings. If these claims are acknowledged or accepted by the court, the third \nparties become claimants in their own right and they enjoy the rights and obligations of \nclaimants in the proceedings; and  \n third parties who do not have their own claims but whose rights might be affected by \nthe court’s judgment on the parties’ claims. These passive third parties must still be \njoined to the proceedings and are entitled to file objections or defences.

On the basis of \nmy review of each of the Statements of Claim in the GPO Proceedings, however, in my view \nthere was no reason in Ukrainian law or procedure for the English Suppliers to be added as \nthird parties to those proceedings. The relief sought in the GPO Proceedings was limited to \ntermination of the five New Borrowers’ loan agreements and the recovery by the Bank of the \nsums borrowed by the five New Borrowers. But the determination of the issues raised in the \nGPO Proceedings (i.e. whether the relevant New Borrowers’ loan agreements should be \nterminated and whether they should be required to repay the sums transferred to them by \nthe Bank) could not, in my opinion, affect any of the rights or obligations of the English \nSuppliers.

Would the provision of the Bank’s transactional data to the First Defendant (or his \nrepresentatives), post-nationalisation, by employees of the Bank, have violated \nUkrainian law? \n The short answer is yes: the provision of the Bank’s transactional data to the First Defendant \nafter he left the Bank, by employees of the Bank (whether current or former), would appear \nto have involved very serious breaches of Ukrainian banking secrecy and data protection \nlaws by both the First Defendant and those employees. \n Banking secrecy law. According to Article 60 of the Law on Banks, any information about \nthe activities or financial position of a bank’s client, which has become known to the bank in \nthe course of servicing and maintaining a relationship with that client, or which has become \nknown to a third party through rendering services to the bank, constitutes a banking secret. \nBanking secrets are expressly stated to include inter alia information about a client’s \naccounts and transactions in those accounts. Under Ukrainian law, the disclosure of banking \nsecrets is generally prohibited save where the disclosure falls within an established \nexception, such as where disclosure is made pursuant to court order or where necessary to \nprotect a bank’s legitimate interests (Article 62(1), (3) of the Law on Banks). I consider that \nnone of these exceptions would apply in the posited scenario. \n Article 61 of the Law on Banks imposes an obligation on bank employees to sign a non-\ndisclosure agreement (“ NDA ”) to keep banking secrets confidential. It also prohibits bank \nemployees from disclosing confidential information that has become known to them during \nthe exercise of their official duties, or to use it for their own benefit or for the benefit of any \nthird parties.  \n The same obligations appear in NBU Resolution No. 267 “On Approval of the Rules for the \nStorage, Protection, Use and Disclosure of Banking Secrets”. In 2012, this Resolution was \namended to provide that the required NDA must contain a term according to which the \nobligation not to disclose banking secrets will survive termination of employment. In July \n2013, this provision was amended such that it currently provides that:"}

In 2012, this Resolution was \namended to provide that the required NDA must contain a term according to which the \nobligation not to disclose banking secrets will survive termination of employment. In July \n2013, this provision was amended such that it currently provides that: “ Employees of the \nbank, when hired, shall sign a commitment to keep the banking secrets confidential ”.  \n I have been provided by Hogan Lovells with template forms of employment agreement that \nI am instructed were used by the Bank from 2010 to 2018 (inclusive). These template \nC1/1/171\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 172 - agreements each contain the following (or materially identical) NDA provisions, stating that \nthe Bank’s employee shall: \n “Not disclose any information covered by trade or bank secrecy rules or other \nconfidential information relating, directly or indirectly, to the Bank’s operations ” (clause \n2.6)203; and \n “Not disclose any information that is for official use only or covered by trade and bank \nsecrecy rules or other confidential information that the Bank will entrust to the Employee \nor that will become known to the Employee in the performance of the Employee’s official \nduties ” (clause 3.1). \n Clause 3.7 addresses the position of former employees: “ After termination of the Employee’s \nemployment with the Bank, the Employee shall not disclose the Bank’s information that is \nfor official use only or covered by trade or bank secrecy rules, within 30 years from the \ntermination of this Contract ” (from 2017 onwards, the referenced 30 year period was reduced \nto 10 years). \n In view of the above, I would conclude that in the posited scenario a breach of Ukraine \nbanking secrecy law has occurred. Depending on the relevant facts, this could potentially \nexpose any employee of the Bank who provided the Bank’s transactional data to the First \nDefendant (whether during or after their employment) to liability for breach of any \nemployment contract and/or, if harm was caused to the Bank, liability under Article 1166 of \nthe Civil Code (the general tort liability). \n Furthermore, the unauthorised disclosure of banking secrets is criminalised in Ukraine under \nArticle 232 of the Criminal Code, violation of which is punishable by an order prohibiting the \ndefendant from occupying certain positions or carrying out certain activities for up to three \nyears and a criminal fine of up to UAH 51,000 (approximately USD 2,000). The Code does \nnot restrict liability to current employees; former employees may also be held liable204. \n If the First Defendant procured current or former employees of the Bank to take actions \namounting to a crime under the above provision, he could himself be found to be criminally \n203  In the template employment agreements that I am instructed were in use from 2012 to 2016, this clause \nwas numbered 2.7 (not 2.6) and the word ‘confidential’ was missing. \n204  Scientific and Practical Commentary to the Criminal Code of Ukraine Volume 2, 2009 by Stasysh V.V. and \nTatsiy V.A.  \nC1/1/172\nEighth Expert Report of Oleh Beketov, 23 November 2021 \n- 173 - liable as an accomplice.

Disclosure of the Bank’s transactional data would also have entailed \ndisclosure of the personal data205 of the Bank’s clients.

Such liability shall be valid after termination of their activity related to \npersonal data, except for cases established by the law”. \n Disclosure by a bank of its clients’ personal data will be permitted in certain circumstances \nspecified in the Data Protection Law, such as where it is necessary in order to protect that \nbank’s legitimate interests (Article 11(6) of the Data Protection Law), but I do not consider \nthat any such exceptions would permit disclosure of such personal data by the bank’s \nemployees in the posited scenario. \n For the reasons set out above, in the posited scenario a breach of Ukrainian data protection \nlaw also appears to have occurred. This would further expose those employees who \nprovided the Bank’s transactional data to the First Defendant to potential liability for breach \nof contract and/or (if harm was caused to the Bank) liability under Article 1166 of the Civil \nCode. \nO2.
